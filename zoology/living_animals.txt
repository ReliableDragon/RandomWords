NEGRO BOY AND APES.

An interesting picture of a Negro boy, with a young Chimpanzee (left side
of figure) and young Orang-utan (right side of figure).]

The welcome accorded to "The Living Races of Mankind," of which the present
work is the natural extension, would be a practical encouragement, if such
were needed, to treat of the Living Races of Animals in like fashion. But
the interest now taken in Natural History is of a kind and calibre never
previously known, and any work which presents the wonders of the Animal
World in a new or clearer form may make some claim to the approval of the
public. The means at the disposal of those responsible for the following
pages are, by mere lapse of time, greater than those of their predecessors.
Every year not only adds to the stock of knowledge of the denizens of earth
and ocean, but increases the facilities for presenting their forms and
surroundings pictorially. Photography applied to the illustration of the
life of beasts, birds, fishes, insects, corals, and plants is at once the
most attractive and the most correct form of illustration. In the following
pages it will be used on a scale never equalled in any previous
publication. Without straining words, it may be said that the subjects
photographed have been obtained from every part of the world, many of them
from the most distant islands of the Southern Ocean, the great barrier reef
of Australia, the New Zealand hills, the Indian jungle, the South African
veldt, and the rivers of British Columbia. Photographs of swimming fish,
the flying bird, and of the leaping salmon will be reproduced as accurately
as those of the large carnivora or the giant ungulates. In accordance with
the example now being set by the Museum of Natural History, the living
breeds of domesticated animals will also find a place.

SKELETONS OF MAN AND GORILLA.

This photograph shows the remarkable similarity in the structure of the
human frame (left) and that of the gorilla (right). This gorilla happened
to be a particularly large specimen; the man was of ordinary height.]

The time and expenditure employed in illustration will be equalled by the
attention given to the descriptive portion of the work. The Editor will
have the assistance of specialists, eminent alike in the world of science
and practical discovery. Mr. F. C. Selous, for example, will deal with the
African Lion and the Elephants, and other sportsmen with the big game of
the Dark Continent. Mr. W. Saville-Kent, the author of "The Great Barrier
Reef of Australia," will treat of the Marsupials of Australia and the
Reptilia; Sir Herbert Maxwell will write on the Salmonidæ, and Mr. F. G.
Aflalo on the Whales and other Cetacea of the deep seas; while Mr. R.
Lydekker, Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, Mr. W. F. Kirby, and other specialists have
kindly agreed to supervise the work. Where possible the illustrations will
show the creatures in their natural surroundings, and in all cases the
photographic portraits of the animals will, by the nature of things,
present true and living pictures, in place of the often curiously incorrect
and distorted objects, the product of illustrators' fancy rather than the
record of facts, not infrequently seen in previous illustrated natural
histories.

AFRICAN LEOPARD.

An example of the black-spotted type of coloration so prevalent in
Carnivora.]

It is possible that while these pages are in the press discoveries of new
animals may be made, or living representatives of creatures supposed to be
extinct may be discovered.[1] One band of explorers is engaged in seeking
on the plains of South America for recent remains and possible survivors of
the giant ground-sloths. Another expedition is engaged, in the island of
Java, in an even more interesting quest. Great as is the difference between
even the lowest human intelligence and the mind of the man-like apes, the
likeness both in form and action of the latter to man has never failed to
suggest that there may have existed, or may even still exist, a higher
anthropoid ape nearer to the human being than those now known. The idea has
taken shape in the term "the missing link." The phrase is misleading in
itself. Such a creature would be no more a link in the descent of man than
one imperfectly developed limb of a tree is a link between the other
branches and the stem. But it was always possible that we might find
another branch which had attained a higher type than those terminating in
the gorilla or chimpanzee. Recent search seems to have discovered the
remains of such a creature.

This photograph was taken in the wilds of Africa by Lord Delamere, and
shows the animal at home. The tree is a mimosa, on the top shoots of which
the giraffe habitually feeds.]

FLYING-FOX.

This bat, which is a native of Australia (where it was photographed), is
commonly called the Flying-fox. Great flocks set out at sunset from the
forest to feed upon the indigenous fruits, such as that of the native fig.]

DOLPHINS.

This photograph was taken in mid-ocean, and shows a couple of dolphins
following a ship across the Atlantic.]

In the island of Java, near one of the homes of the man-like apes of
to-day, a naturalist, M. Dubois, employed by the Dutch Government,
excavated some fossil-bearing gravels on a river called the Solo. These
gravels belong to a period when civilised man, at any rate, did not exist.
In them he found a great quantity of bones of mammals and of prehistoric
crocodiles. There were no perfect skeletons, and it was fairly plain that
the bodies of the creatures had been floated down the river, and there
pulled to pieces by the crocodiles, just as they are in India to-day. In
this place, lying within a distance of about fifteen yards from each other,
he made an extraordinary discovery of animal remains. This was no less than
the top of the skull of a creature much higher in development than the
chimpanzee or gorilla, but lower than the lowest type of human skull. Near
it were also found two of the teeth and one of the bones of the thigh. The
thigh bone resembles very nearly that of a man, though Dr. Virchow, whom
Englishmen remember in connection with the fatal illness of the German
Emperor Frederick, considered it did not differ from that of one of the
gibbons. The inference is that the creature _walked upright_; and this fact
is recorded in its scientific name.

A HAPPY FAMILY.

Hyæna, tiger, and lions living in amity--a remarkable proof of their
tamer's power. In the same park at Hamburg, belonging to Herr Hagenbeck,
are also bears, dogs, leopards, and pumas, all loose together.]

As regards the skull, some specialists in anthropology said that it was
that of a large ape, of a kind of gibbon (a long-armed, upright-walking
ape, described later), of a "higher anthropoid ape," and of a low type of
man. Finally, Dr. Cunningham, the able secretary of the Royal Irish
Zoological Society, said it resembled that of a "microcephalous idiot." It
is rather strange if the remains of the first and only man found in the
Lower Pleistocene should happen to be those of a microcephalous idiot, for
out of many millions of men born there are perhaps only one or two of this
type. Compared with the head of any of the living apes, it is very large.
Its brain-holding power is about five to three compared with the skull of a
gorilla, and two to one compared with that of a chimpanzee.

There is a tradition in Sumatra that man-like apes exist, of a higher
character than the orang-utan. Pending the discovery of more remains, the
following extract is worth quoting, as giving shape to current ideas about
such creatures both here and among the Malays. They take form in a very
curious and interesting book, called "The Prison of Weltevreden," written
by Walter M. Gibson in the middle of the last century. His story is that he
was kept in prison at Weltevreden, in Java, by the Dutch, after leading a
life of adventure and enquiry among the islands of the South Atlantic and
Indian Ocean; that he came in his own small vessel to the Malay
Archipelago, and spent some time in the interior of Sumatra, _where he saw
apparent evidences of semi-human beings_. He saw the orang-utans in their
native forest, and noted that they were covered with red hair, and was
surprised at the slowness of their movements. Among some men engaged in
building a stable for the raja, he saw "a dark form, tall as a middle-sized
man, covered with hair, that looked soft and flowing; the arms, hands,
legs, and feet seemed well formed, like the Malays'; the body was straight,
and easily bore, on the right shoulder, the yoke of two heavy panniers
filled with material for the building which was going on." Gibson says that
"the eyes were clearer, the nose fuller, and the lips thinner than those of
the common Malay, but the mouth was wide, the lips protruding, and a chin
formed no part of its hairy face; yet it was pleasantly human in
expression," much more so than the dirty, mottle-faced coolies and lascars
he had seen. We quote the account, as showing, if true, that Gibson saw an
anthropoid ape _taught to work_.

[Illustration: SOMALI ZEBRAS.

This is a photograph of a group of zebras taken in Africa by Lord Delamere,

freedom.]

It may be a mere coincidence, but it is nevertheless somewhat remarkable
that the two great black man-like apes, the chimpanzee and the gorilla,
inhabit the same continent as some of the blackest races of mankind, while
the red orang-utan is found in countries where the yellow-skinned Malay
races of man are indigenous.

THE CHIMPANZEE.

Of all the great apes the CHIMPANZEE most closely approaches man in bodily
structure and appearance, although in height it is less near the human
standard than the gorilla, 5 feet being probably that of an adult male.

Several races of this ape are known, among them the TRUE CHIMPANZEE and the
BALD CHIMPANZEE. The varieties also include the Kulo-kamba, described by Du
Chaillu, and the Soko, discovered by Livingstone, who confounded it with
the gorilla. But the variations in neither of these are sufficiently
important to justify their being ranked as species.

The first authentic mention of the chimpanzee is found in "The Strange
Adventures of Andrew Battell." an English sailor taken prisoner by the
Portuguese in 1590, who lived eighteen years near Angola. He speaks of two
apes, the Pongo and the Enjocko, of which the former is the gorilla, the
latter the chimpanzee. The animal was first seen in Europe in 1641, and
described scientifically fifty-eight years later, but we are indebted to
Dr. Savage, a missionary, for our first account of its habits, in 1847.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

"JENNY," THE WELL-KNOWN CHIMPANZEE AT THE ZOO.
A VERY CHARACTERISTIC POSE.

In this picture the rounded ear, human-like wrinkles on the forehead, and
length of the toes should be noted.]

The chimpanzee, like the gorilla, is found only in Africa. The range
includes West and Central Equatorial Africa, from the Gambia in the north
to near Angola in the south, while it occurs in the Niam-Niam country to
the north-west of the great lakes, and has been discovered recently in
Uganda. The new Uganda Railway, which will open out the great lakes to the
east, will bring English travellers well within reach of the nearest haunt
of these great apes. It is on the likeness and difference of their form and
shape to those of man that the attention of the world has been mainly
fixed.

The chimpanzee is a heavily built animal, with chest and arms of great
power. The male is slightly taller than the female. The crown is depressed,
the chin receding, the ridges which overhang the eye-sockets more prominent
than in man, less so than in the gorilla. The nose has a short bridge, and
a flat extremity. The ear is large, and less human than that of the
gorilla. The hands and feet are comparatively long; the digits are, except
the thumb and great toe, joined by a web. The arms are short for an ape,
reaching only to the knees. The teeth are similar to those of man, and the
canines of only moderate size. The chimpanzee has thirteen pairs of ribs,
and, like man, has a suggestion at the end of the vertebræ of a rudimentary
tail. It walks on all-fours, with the backs of its closed fingers on the
ground, and can only stand upright by clasping its hands above its head.
The skin is of a reddish or brown flesh-colour, the hair black, with white
patches on the lower part of the face. The bald chimpanzee has the top
front, and sides of the face bare, exceedingly large ears, thick lips, and
black or brown hands and feet.

The chimpanzee's natural home is the thick forest, where tropical
vegetation ensures almost total gloom. But near Loango it frequents the
mountains near the coast. It is a fruit-feeding animal, said to do much
damage to plantations, but the bald race, at all events in captivity, takes
readily to flesh, and the famous "Sally" which lived in the Zoo for over
six years used to kill and eat pigeons, and caught and killed rats. The
male chimpanzee builds a nest in a tree for his family, and sleeps under
its shelter; when food becomes scarce in the vicinity, a move is made, and
a new nest built. This ape lives either in separate families or communities
not exceeding ten in number, and is monogamous.

As to the animal's courage, it is difficult to get accurate information, as
the sins of the gorilla and baboon have often been laid on its shoulders,
and information derived from natives is usually untrustworthy. Apparently
the chimpanzee avoids coming into collision with man, although, when
attacked, it is a formidable antagonist. Tales of chimpanzees kidnapping
women and children need stronger evidence than they have yet obtained. The
natives kill this ape by spearing it in the back, or by driving it into
nets, where it is entangled and easily dispatched. According to
Livingstone, the soko, as the chimpanzee is called in East Central Africa,
kills the leopard by biting its paws, but falls an easy prey to the lion.

A YOUNG CHIMPANZEE.

This excellent photograph, by Major Nott, F.Z.S., is particularly good, as
showing the manner in which these animals use their hands and feet.]

In captivity it is docile and intelligent, but usually fails to stand a
northern climate for more than a few months. It is easily taught to wear
clothes, to eat and drink in civilised fashion, to understand what is said
to it, and reply with a limited vocabulary of grunts. Sally learnt to count
perfectly up to six, and less perfectly to ten; she could also distinguish
white from any colour, but if other colours were presented her she failed,
apparently from colour-blindness. Of this ape the late Dr. G. J. Romanes
wrote with something more than the enthusiasm of a clever man pursuing a
favourite theme: "Her intelligence was conspicuously displayed by the
remarkable degree in which she was able to understand the meaning of spoken
language--a degree fully equal to that presented by an infant a few months
before emerging from infancy, and therefore higher than that which is
presented by any brute, so far at least as I have evidence to show."
Romanes here speaks _only_, be it noticed, of ability to understand human
speech--not to think and act. But this is in itself a great mark of
intelligence _on human lines_. "Having enlisted the co-operation of the
keepers, I requested them to ask the ape repeatedly for one straw, two
straws, three straws. These she was to pick up and hand out from among the
litter of her cage. No constant order was to be observed in making these
requests; but whenever she handed a number not asked for her offer was to
be refused, while if she gave the proper number her offer was to be
accepted, and she was to receive a piece of fruit in payment. In this way
the ape had learnt to associate these three numbers with the names. As soon
as the animal understood what was required, she never failed to give the
number of straws asked for. Her education was then completed in a similar
manner from three to four, and from four to five straws. Sally rarely made
mistakes up to that number; but above five, and up to ten, to which one of
the keepers endeavoured to advance her education, the result is uncertain.
It is evident that she understands the words seven, eight, nine, and ten to
betoken numbers higher than those below them. When she was asked for any
number above six, she always gave some number over six and under ten. She
sometimes doubled over a straw to make it present two ends, and was
supposed (thus) to hasten the attainment of her task." By no means all the
chimpanzees are so patient as Sally. One kept in the Zoological Gardens for
some time made an incessant noise by stamping on the back of the box in
which it was confined. It struck this with the flat of its foot while
hanging to the cross-bar or perch, and made a prodigious din. This seems to
bear out the stories of chimpanzees assembling and drumming on logs in the
Central African forests.

HEAD OF MALE GORILLA.

This is a photograph of one of the first gorillas ever brought to England.
It was sent by the famous M. du Chaillu.]


THE GORILLA.

The name of this enormous ape has been known since 450 B.C. Hanno the
Carthaginian, when off Sierra Leone, met with wild men and women whom the
interpreter called GORILLAS. The males escaped and flung stones from the
rocks, but several females were captured. These animals could not have been
gorillas, but were probably baboons. Andrew Battell, already mentioned,
described the gorilla under the name of Pongo. He says it is like a man,
but without understanding even to put a log on a fire; it kills Negroes,
and drives off the elephant with clubs; it is never taken alive, but its
young are killed with poisoned arrows; it covers its dead with boughs. Dr.
Savage described it in 1847. Later Du Chaillu visited its haunts, and his
well-known book relates how he met and killed several specimens. But Mr.
Winwood Reade, who also went in quest of it, declared that Du Chaillu, like
himself, never saw a live gorilla. Von Koppenfels, however, saw a family of
four feeding, besides shooting others. The late Miss Kingsley met several,
one of which was killed by her elephant-men.

The gorilla has a limited range, extending from 2° north to 5° south
latitude in West Africa, a moist overgrown region including the mouth of
the Gaboon River. How far east it is found is uncertain, but it is known in
the Sierra del Cristal. In 1851-52 it was seen in considerable numbers on
the coast.

The gorilla is the largest, strongest, and most formidable of the Primates.
An adult male is from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet high, heavily built, with
arms and chest of extraordinary power. The arms reach to the middle of the
legs. The hands are clumsy, the thumb short, and the fingers joined by a
web. The neck scarcely exists. The leg has a slight calf. The toes are
stumpy and thick; the great toe moves like a thumb. The head is large and
receding, with enormous ridges above the eyes, which give it a diabolical
appearance. The canine teeth are developed into huge tusks. The nose has a
long bridge, and the nostrils look downwards. The ear is small and
man-like.

In colour the gorilla varies from deep black to iron-grey, with a reddish
tinge on the head; old animals become grizzled. The outer hair is ringed
grey and brown; beneath it is a woolly growth. The female is smaller--not
exceeding 4 feet 6 inches--and less hideous, as the canines are much
smaller, and the ridges above the eyes are not noticeable, a feature common
also to the young.

Timid, superstitious natives and credulous or untrustworthy travellers have
left still wrapped in mystery many of the habits of this mighty ape, whose
fever-stricken, forest-clad haunts render investigation always difficult,
often impossible. Many tales of its ferocity and strength are obviously
untrue, but we think that too much has been disbelieved. That a huge arm
descends from a tree, draws up and chokes the wayfarer, must be false, for
intelligent natives have confessed to knowing no instance of the gorilla
attacking man. That it vanquishes the leopard is probable; that it has
driven the lion from its haunts requires proof. Nor can we accept tales of
the carrying-off of Negro women; and the defeat of the elephants, too, must
be considered a fiction.

But we must believe that this ape, if provoked or wounded, is a terrible
foe, capable of ripping open a man with one stroke of its paw, or of
cracking the skull of a hunter as easily as a squirrel cracks a nut. There
is a tale of a tribe that kept an enormous gorilla as executioner, which
tore its victims to pieces, until an Englishman, doomed to meet it,
noticing a large swelling near its ribs, killed it with a heavy blow or two
on the weak spot.

Gorillas live mainly in the trees on whose fruit they subsist; they
construct a shelter in the lower boughs for the family, and as a lying-in
place for the female. The male is said to sleep below, with his back
against the tree--a favourite attitude with both sexes--to keep off
leopards. On the ground it moves on all-fours, with a curious swinging
action, caused by putting its hands with fingers extended on the ground,
and bringing its body forward by a half-jump. Having a heel, it can stand
better than other apes; but this attitude is not common, and Du Chaillu
appears to have been mistaken when he describes the gorilla as attacking
upright.

In captivity only immature specimens have been seen--Barnum's great ape
being one of the larger forms of chimpanzee. Accounts vary as to the temper
of the gorilla, some describing it as untamable, while others say it is
docile and playful when young. There is an American tale that a gorilla
over 6 feet high was captured near Tanganyika, but nothing more has reached
us about it.

When enraged, a gorilla beats its breast, as the writer was informed by a
keeper, who thus confirmed Du Chaillu's account. Its usual voice is a
grunt, which, when the animal is excited, becomes a roar.

[Illustration: _By permission of Herr Umlauff_]     [_Hamburg._

A MALE GORILLA.

This photograph of the largest gorilla known was taken immediately after
death by Herr Paschen at Yaunde, and gives an excellent idea of the size of
these animals as compared with Negroes. The animal weighed 400 lbs.]


THE ORANG-UTAN.

This great red ape was mentioned by Linnæus in 1766, and at the beginning
of the last century a specimen living in the Prince of Orange's collection
was described by Vosmaer.

There are three varieties of the ORANG, called by the Dyaks MIAS-PAPPAN,
MIAS-RAMBI, and MIAS-KASSU, the third of which is smaller, has no
cheek-excrescences, and very large teeth. Some naturalists recognise a pale
and a dark race.

Most of our information is due to Raja Brooke and Dr. Wallace. The species
is confined to Borneo and Sumatra, but fossils have been found in India of
this genus, as well as of a chimpanzee. The orang is less man-like than the
chimpanzee and gorilla. In height the male varies from 3 feet 10 inches to
4 feet 6 inches, the female being a few inches shorter. It is a heavy
creature, with large head--often a foot in breadth--thick neck, powerful
arms, which reach nearly to the ankles, and protuberant abdomen. Its legs
are short and bowed. The forehead is high, the nose fairly large, the ears
very human. The throat is ornamented with large pouches, and there are
often callosities on the cheeks. The fingers are webbed, the thumb small,
the foot long and narrow, the great toe small and often without a nail. The
brain is man-like, and the ribs agree in number with those of man; but
there are nine bones in the wrist, whereas man, the gorilla, and the
chimpanzee have but eight. The canine teeth are enormous in the male. The
hair, a foot or more long on the shoulders and thighs, is yellowish red:
there is a slight beard. The skin is grey or brown, and often, in adults,
black.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

YOUNG ORANG-UTANS.

It will be seen here, from the profile, that the young anthropoid ape has
only the upper part of the head at all approaching the human type.]

The orang is entirely a tree-living animal, and is only found in moist
districts where there is much virgin forest. On the ground it progresses
clumsily on all-fours, using its arms as crutches, and with the side only
of its feet on the ground. In trees it travels deliberately but with
perfect ease, swinging along underneath the branches, although it also
walks along them semi-erect. It lives alone with mate and young, and builds
a sleeping-place sufficiently low to avoid the wind. Its food is leaves and
fruit, especially the durian; its feeding-time, midday.

No animal molests the mias save--so say the Dyaks--the python and
crocodile, both of which it kills by tearing with its hands. It never
attacks man, but has been known to bite savagely when brought to bay, and
it is very tenacious of life, one being found by Mr. Wallace still alive
after a fall from a tree, when "both legs had been broken, its hip-joint
and the root of the spine shattered, and two bullets flattened in neck and
jaws."

In captivity young orangs are playful and docile, but passionate. Less
intelligent than chimpanzees, they may be taught to eat and drink nicely,
and to obey simple commands. One in the Zoo at present has acquired the
rudiments of drill. They will eat meat and eggs, and drink wine, beer,
spirits, and tea. An orang described years ago by Dr. Clarke Abel was
allowed the run of the ship on the voyage to England, and would play with
the sailors in the rigging. When refused food he pretended to commit
suicide, and rushed over the side, only to be found under the chains.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

BABY ORANG-UTANS AT PLAY.]

The orang is the least interesting of the three great apes; he lacks the
power and brutality of the gorilla and the intelligence of the chimpanzee.
"The orang," said its keeper to the writer, "is a buffoon; the chimpanzee,
a gentleman."

It is worth remark that, although all these apes soon die in our
menageries, in Calcutta, where they are kept in the open, orangs thrive
well.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

TWO BABY ORANG-UTANS. THE TUG-OF-WAR.]


THE GIBBONS.

Next after the great apes in man-like characters come a few long-armed,
tailless apes, known as the GIBBONS. Like the orang-utan, they live in the
great tropical forests of Asia, especially the Indian Archipelago; like the
latter, they are gentle, affectionate creatures; and they have also a
natural affection for man. But it is in mind and temperament, rather than
in skeleton, that the links and differences between men and monkeys must be
sought. It will be found that these forest apes differ from other animals
and from the true monkeys mainly in this--that they are predisposed to be
friendly to man and to obey him, and that they have no bias towards
mischief, or "monkey tricks." They are thoughtful, well behaved, and
sedate.

[Illustration: _By permission of Herr Umlauff._

THE LARGEST GORILLA EVER CAPTURED.

This huge ape, 5 feet 5 inches high, measures a distance of over 8 feet
from finger to finger.]

The SIAMANG, one of the largest of the long-armed, tailless gibbons, lives
in the Malay Archipelago. The arms of a specimen only 3 feet high measured
5 feet 6 inches across. This, like all the gibbons, makes its way from tree
to tree mainly by swinging itself by its arms. But the siamang can _walk_
upright and run. One kept on board ship would walk down the cabin
breakfast-table without upsetting the china. The WHITE-HANDED GIBBON is
found in Tenasserim, south-west of Burma. This ape has a musical howl,
which the whole flock utters in the early mornings on the tree-tops. In
Northern India, in the hills beyond the Brahmaputra, lives another gibbon,
the HULOCK. One of these kept in captivity soon learnt to eat properly at
meals, and to drink out of a cup instead of dipping his fingers in the tea
and milk and then sucking them. The SILVERY GIBBON kept at the Zoological
Gardens was a most amiable pet, and had all the agility of the other
gibbons. It is very seldom seen in this country, being a native of Java,
where it is said to show the most astonishing activity among the tall
cane-groves. One of the first ever brought to England belonged to the great
Lord Clive. The AGILE GIBBON is another and darker ape of this group.

The list of the man-like apes closes with this group. All the gibbons are
highly specialised for tree-climbing and an entirely arboreal life; but it
is undeniable that, apart from the modifications necessary for this, such
as the abnormal length of the arms, the skeleton closely resembles that of
a human being. In their habits, when wild, none of these apes show any
remarkable degree of intelligence; but their living is gained in so simple
a way, by plucking fruits and leaves, that there is nothing in their
surroundings to stimulate thought. They do not need even to think of a time
of famine or winter, or to lay up a stock of food for such a season,
because they live in the forests under the Equator.

The great length of arm in comparison with the body and head should here be
noted.]


MONKEYS.

THE DOG-SHAPED MONKEYS.

After the gibbons come a vast number of monkeys of every conceivable size,
shape, and variety, which naturalists have arranged in consecutive order
with fair success. Until we reach the Baboons, and go on to the South
American Monkeys and the Lemurs, it is not easy to give any idea of what
these monkeys do or look like merely by referring to their scientific
groups. The usual order of natural histories will here be followed, and the
descriptions will, so far as possible, present the habits and appearance of
the monkeys specially noticed.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

HEAD OF PROBOSCIS MONKEY.

A native of Borneo. Next to the orang-utan, the most striking monkey in the
Malay Archipelago.]

This great family of true monkeys contains the Sacred Monkeys, or Langurs,
of India, the Guerezas and Guenons of Africa, the Mangabeys, Macaques, and
Baboons. Most of them have naked, hard patches of skin on the hindquarters,
and the partition between the nostrils is narrow. Some have tails, some
none, and they exhibit the most astonishing differences of size and shape.
Perhaps the most grotesque and astonishing of them all is the PROBOSCIS
MONKEY. It is allied to the langurs, and is a native of the island of
Borneo, to which it is confined; its home is the west bank of the Sarawak
River. It is an arboreal creature, living in small companies. Mr. Hose, who
saw them in their native haunts, says that the proboscis monkeys kept in
the trees overhanging the river, and were most difficult to shoot. "I saw
altogether about 150 of these monkeys, and without a single exception all
were in trees over the water, either lake, river, or in submerged forest.
As long as they are in sight, they are very conspicuous objects, choosing
the most commanding positions on open tree-tops. Once I saw thirteen in one
tree, sitting lazily on the branches, as is their habit, sunning
themselves, and enjoying the scenery." They are very striking animals in
colour, as well as in form. The face is cinnamon-brown, the sides marked
with reddish brown and white, the belly white, the back red-brown and dark
brown. Next to the orang-utan, these are the most striking monkeys in the
Malay Archipelago.

The greater number of the species intermediate between the gibbons and the
New World species are called "DOG-SHAPED" MONKEYS. We wonder why? Only the
baboon and a few others are in the least like dogs. The various SACRED
MONKEYS of India are often seen in this country, and are quite
representative of the "miscellaneous" monkeys in general. Most of them have
cheek-pouches, a useful monkey-pocket. They poke food into their pouches,
which unfold to be filled, or lie flat when not wanted; and with a
pocketful of nuts or rice on either side of their faces, they can scream,
eat, bite, or scold quite comfortably, which they could not do with their
mouths full. The pouchless monkeys have only their big stomachs to rely on.

The ENTELLUS MONKEY is the most sacred of all in India. It is grey above
and nutty brown below, long-legged and active, a thief and an impudent
robber. In one of the Indian cities they became such a nuisance that the
faithful determined to catch and send away some hundreds. This was done,
and the holy monkeys were deported in covered carts, and released many
miles off. But the monkeys were too clever. Having thoroughly enjoyed their
ride, they all refused to part with the carts, and, hopping and grimacing,
came leaping all the way back beside them to the city, grateful for their
outing. One city obtained leave to kill the monkeys; but the next city then
sued them for "killing their deceased ancestors." In these monkey-infested
cities, if one man wishes to spite another, he throws a few handfuls of
rice on to the roof of his house about the rainy season. The monkeys come,
find the rice, and quietly lift off many of the tiles and throw them away,
seeking more rice in the interstices.

CROSS-BEARING LANGUR AND YOUNG.

A forest monkey of Borneo.]

This is not the monkey commonly seen in the hills and at Simla. The large
long-tailed monkey there is the HIMALAYAN LANGUR, one of the common animals
of the hills. "The langur," says Mr. Lockwood Kipling in his "Beast and Man
in India," "is, in his way, a king of the jungle, nor is he often met with
in captivity. In some parts of India troops of langurs come bounding with a
mighty air of interest and curiosity to look at passing trains, their long
tails lifted like notes of interrogation; but frequently, when fairly
perched on a wall or tree alongside, they seem to forget all about it, and
avert their heads with an affectation of languid indifference."

In India no distinction is made between monkeys. It is an abominable act of
sacrilege to kill one of any kind. In the streets holy bulls, calves,
parrakeets, sparrows, and monkeys all rob the shops. One monkey-ridden
municipality sent off its inconvenient but holy guests by rail, advising
the stationmaster to let them loose at the place to which they were
consigned. The station, Saharanpur, was a kind of Indian Crewe, and the
monkeys got into the engine-sheds and workshops among the driving-wheels
and bands. One got in the double roof of an inspection-car, and thence
stole mutton, corkscrews, camp-glasses, and dusters. Among many other
interesting and correct monkey stories of Mr. Kipling's is the following:
"The chief confectioner of Simla had prepared a most splendid bride-cake,
which was safely put by in a locked room, that, like most back rooms in
Simla, looked out on the mountain-side. It is little use locking the door
when the window is left open. When they came to fetch the bride-cake, the
last piece of it was being handed out of the window by a chain of monkeys,
who whitened the hill-side with its fragments."

From India to Ceylon is no great way, yet in the latter island different
monkeys are found. The two best known are the WHITE-BEARDED WANDEROO MONKEY
and the GREAT WANDEROO. Both are grave, well-behaved monkeys. The former
has white whiskers and a white beard, and looks so wise he is called in
Latin _Nestor_, after the ancient counsellor of the Greeks. Nice, clean
little monkeys are these, and pretty pets. The great wanderoo is rarer. It
lives in the hills. "A flock of them," says Mr. Dallas, "will take
possession of a palm-grove, and so well can they conceal themselves in the
leaves that the whole party become invisible. The presence of a dog excites
their irresistible curiosity, and in order to watch his movements they
never fail to betray themselves. They may be seen congregated on the roof
of a native hut. Some years ago the child of a European clergyman, having
been left on the ground by a nurse, was bitten and teased to death by them.
These monkeys have only one wife." Near relatives of the langurs are the
two species of SNUB-NOSED MONKEYS, one of which (see figure on page 18)
inhabits Eastern Tibet and North-western China, and the other the valley of
the Mekong.

[Illustration: GELADA BABOONS AT HOME

This photograph is probably unique, as a gelada baboon has been rarely
seen. It shows them at home looking for food on the ground under the
bamboos and palms. It was taken by Lord Delamere in the East African
jungle.]

Among the ordinary monkeys of the Old World are some with very striking
hair and colours. The GUEREZA of Abyssinia has bright white-and-black fur,
with long white fringes on the sides. This is the black-and-white skin
fastened by the Abyssinians to their shields, and, if we are not wrong, by
the Kaffirs also. Among the GUENONS, a large tribe of monkeys living in the
African forests, many of which find their way here as "organ monkeys," is
the DIANA, a most beautiful creature, living on the Guinea Coast. It has a
white crescent on its forehead, bluish-grey fur, a white beard, and a patch
of brilliant chestnut on the back, the belly white and orange. A lady, Mrs.
Bowditch, gives the following account of a Diana monkey on board ship. It
jumped on to her shoulder, stared into her face, and then made friends,
seated itself on her knees, and carefully examined her hands. "He then
tried to pull off my rings, when I gave him some biscuits, and making a bed
for him with my handkerchief he then settled himself comfortably to sleep;
and from that moment we were sworn allies. When mischievous, he was often
banished to a hen-coop. Much more effect was produced by taking him in
sight of the panther, who always seemed most willing to devour him. On
these occasions I held him by the tail before the cage; but long before I
reached it, knowing where he was going, he pretended to be dead. His eyes
were closed quite fast, and every limb was as stiff as though there were no
life in him. When taken away, he would open one eye a little, to see
whereabouts he might be; but if he caught sight of the panther's cage it
was instantly closed, and he became as stiff as before." This monkey stole
the men's knives, tools, and handkerchiefs, and even their caps, which he
threw into the sea. He would carefully feed the parrots, chewing up biscuit
and presenting them the bits; and he caught another small monkey and
painted it black! Altogether, he must have enlivened the voyage. The GRIVET
MONKEY, the GREEN MONKEY, the MONA MONKEY, and the MANGABEY are other
commonly seen African species.

THE MACAQUES.

The MACAQUES, of which there are many kinds, from the Rock of Gibraltar to
far Japan, occupy the catalogue between the guenon and the baboon. The
COMMON MACAQUE and many others have tails. Those of Japan, and some of
those of China, notably the TCHELI MONKEY, kept outside the monkey-house at
the Zoo, and the JAPANESE MACAQUE, at the other entrance, are tailless, and
much more like anthropoid apes. The Tcheli monkey is large and powerful,
but other macaques are of all sizes down to little creatures no bigger than
a kitten. Some live in the hottest plains, others in the mountains. The
COMMON MACAQUE, found in the Malay Archipelago, is a strong, medium-sized
monkey. The FORMOSAN MACAQUE is a rock-living creature; those of Japan
inhabit the pine-groves, and are fond of pelting any one who passes with
stones and fir-cones. The BONNET MACAQUE is an amusing little beast, very
fond of hugging and nursing others in captivity. The BANDAR or RHESUS
MONKEY, a common species, also belongs to this group. But the most
interesting to Europeans is the MAGOT, or BARBARY APE. It is the last
monkey left in Europe. There it only lives on the Rock of Gibraltar. It was
the monkey which Galen is said to have dissected, because he was not
permitted to dissect a human body. These monkeys are carefully preserved
upon the Rock. Formerly, when they were more common, they were very
mischievous. The following story was told by Mr. Bidcup: "The apes of the
Rock, led by one particular monkey, were always stealing from the kit of a
certain regiment encamped there. At last the soldiers caught the leader,
shaved his head and face, and turned him loose. His friends, who had been
watching, received him with a shower of sticks and stones. In these
desperate circumstances the ape sneaked back to his old enemies, the
soldiers, with whom he remained." Lord Heathfield, a former Governor of the
Rock, would never let them be hurt; and on one occasion, when the Spaniards
were attempting a surprise, the noise made by the apes gave notice of their
attempt.

THE BABOONS.

Far the most interesting of the apes in the wild state are the BABOONS.
Their dog-like heads (which in some are so large and hideous that they look
like a cross between an ill-tempered dog and a pig), short bodies,
enormously strong arms, and loud barking cry distinguish them from all
other creatures. The greater number--for there are many kinds--live in the
hot, dry, stony parts of Africa. They are familiar figures from the cliffs
of Abyssinia to the Cape, where their bold and predatory bands still occupy
Table Mountain. They are almost the only animals which the high-contracting
Powers of Africa have resolved not to protect at any season, so mischievous
are they to crops, and recently to the flocks. They kill the suckling
lambs, and tear them to pieces for the sake of the milk contained in their
bodies.

BARBARY APE.

One of the best-known baboons is the CHACMA of South Africa. The old males
grow to a great size, and are most formidable creatures. Naturally, they
are very seldom caught; but one very large one is in the Zoological
Gardens, Regent's Park, at the time of writing. The keeper declares he
would rather go into a lion's cage than into the den of this beast when
angry. Its head is nearly one-third of its total length from nose to the
root of the tail. Its jaw-power is immense, and its forearm looks as strong
as Sandow's. Like all monkeys, this creature has the power of springing
instantaneously from a sitting position; and its bite would cripple
anything from a man to a leopard. The chacmas live in companies in the
kopjes, whence they descend to forage the mealie-grounds, river-beds, and
bush. Thence they come down to steal fruit and pumpkins or corn, turn over
the stones and catch beetles, or eat locusts. Their robbing expeditions are
organised. Scouts keep a look-out, the females and young are put in the
centre, and the retreat is protected by the old males. Children in the Cape
Colony are always warned not to go out when the baboons are near. When
irritated--and they are very touchy in their tempers--the whole of the
males will sometimes charge and attack. The possibility of this is very
unpleasant, and renders people cautious.

RHESUS MONKEY.

A young specimen of the common Bengal monkey.]

Not many years ago a well-known sportsman was shooting in Somaliland. On
the other side of a rocky ravine was a troop of baboons of a species of
which no examples were in the British Museum. Though he knew the danger, he
was tempted to shoot and to secure a skin. At 200 yards he killed one dead,
which the rest did not notice. Then he hit another and wounded it. The
baboon screamed, and instantly the others sat up, saw the malefactor, and
charged straight for him. Most fortunately, they had to scramble down the
ravine and up again, by which time the sportsman and his servant had put
such a distance between them, making "very good time over the flat," that
the baboons contented themselves by barking defiance at them when they
reached the level ground.

RHESUS MONKEY AND SOOTY MANGABEY.

The sooty mangabey (to the right of the picture) is gentle and
companionable, but petulant and active.]

They are the only mammals which _thoroughly_ understand combination for
defence as well as attack. But Brehm, the German traveller, gives a
charming story of genuine courage and self-sacrifice shown by one. His
hunting dogs gave chase to a troop which was retreating to some cliffs, and
cut off a very young one, which ran up on to a rock, only just out of reach
of the dogs. An old male baboon saw this, and came alone to the rescue.
Slowly and deliberately he descended, crossed the open space, and stamping
his hands on the ground, showing his teeth, and backed by the furious barks
of the rest of the baboons, he disconcerted and cowed these savage dogs,
climbed on to the rock, picked up the baby, and carried him back safely. If
the dogs had attacked the old patriarch, his tribe would probably have
helped him. Burchell, the naturalist after whom Burchell's zebra is named,
let his dogs chase a troop. The baboons turned on them, killed one on the
spot by biting through the great blood-vessels of the neck, and laid bare
the ribs of another. The Cape Dutch in the Old Colony would rather let
their dogs bait a lion than a troop of baboons. The rescue of the infant
chacma which Brehm saw himself is a remarkable, and indeed the most
incontestable, instance of the exhibition of courage and self-sacrifice by
a _male_ animal.

If the baboons were not generally liable to become bad-tempered when they
grow old, they could probably be trained to be among the most useful of
animal helpers and servers; but they are so formidable, and so uncertain in
temper, that they are almost too dangerous for attempts at
semi-domestication. When experiments have been made, they have had
remarkable results. Le Vaillant, one of the early explorers in South
Africa, had a chacma baboon which was a better watch than any of his dogs.
It gave warning of any creature approaching the camp at night long before
the dogs could hear or smell it. He took it out with him when he was
shooting, and used to let it collect edible roots for him. The latest
example of a trained baboon only died a few years ago. It belonged to a
railway signalman at Uitenhage station, about 200 miles up-country from
Port Elizabeth, in Cape Colony. The man had the misfortune to undergo an
operation in which both his feet were amputated, after being crushed by the
wheels of a train. Being an ingenious fellow, he taught his baboon, which
was a full-grown one, to pull him along the line on a trolly to the
"distant" signal. There the baboon stopped at the word of command, and the
man would work the lever himself. But in time he taught the baboon to do
it, while he sat on the trolly, ready to help if any mistake were made.

BONNET MONKEY, AND ARABIAN BABOON (ON THE RIGHT).]

The chacmas have for relations a number of other baboons in the rocky parts
of the African Continent, most of which have almost the same habits, and
are not very different in appearance. Among them is the GELADA BABOON, a
species very common in the rocky highlands of Abyssinia; another is the
ANUBIS BABOON of the West Coast of Africa. The latter is numerous round the
Portuguese settlement of Angola. Whether the so-called COMMON BABOON of the
menageries is a separate species or only the young of some one of the
above-mentioned is not very clear. But about another variety there can be
no doubt. It has been separated from the rest since the days of the
Pharaohs. It does not differ in habits from the other baboons, but inhabits
the rocky parts of the Nile Valley. It appears in Egyptian mythology under
the name of Thoth, and is constantly seen in the sculptures and
hieroglyphs.

RHESUS MONKEYS.

This photograph is particularly interesting. It was actually taken by
another monkey, which pressed the button of Mr. Medland's camera.]

Equally strong and far more repulsive are the two baboons of West
Africa--the DRILL and the MANDRILL. As young specimens of these beasts are
the only ones at all easily caught, and these nearly always die when
cutting their second teeth when in captivity, large adult mandrills are
seldom seen in Europe. They grow to a great size, and are probably the most
hideous of all beasts. The frightful nose, high cheekbones, and pig-like
eyes are the basis of the horrible heads of devils and goblins which Albert
Dürer and other German or Dutch mediæval painters sometimes put on canvas.
Add to the figure the misplaced bright colours--cobalt-blue on the cheeks,
which are scarred, as if by a rake, with scarlet furrows, and scarlet on
the buttocks--and it will be admitted that nature has invested this
massive, powerful, and ferocious baboon with a repulsiveness equalling in
completeness the extremes of grace and beauty manifested in the roe-deer or
the bird of paradise.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

ORANGE SNUB-NOSED MONKEY.

This should be contrasted with the Proboscis Monkey.]

The natives of Guinea and other parts of West Africa have consistent
accounts that the mandrills have tried to carry off females and children.
They live in troops like the chacmas, plunder the fields, and, like all
baboons, spend much time on the ground walking on all-fours. When doing
this, they are quite unlike any other creatures. They walk slowly, with the
head bent downwards, like a person walking on hands and knees looking for a
pin. With the right hand (usually) they turn over every stick and stone,
looking for insects, scorpions, or snails, and these they seize and eat.
The writer has seen baboons picking up sand, and straining it through their
fingers, to see if there were ants in it. He has also seen one hold up sand
in the palm of its hand, and blow the dust away with its breath, and then
look again to see if anything edible were left. Mandrills kept in captivity
until adult become very savage. One in Wombwell's menagerie killed another
monkey and a beagle. Mr. Cross owned one which would sit in an armchair,
smoke, and drink porter; but these convivial accomplishments were
accompanied by a most ferocious temper.

One of the earliest accounts of the habits of the Abyssinian baboons was
given by Ludolf in his "History of Ethiopia." It was translated into
quaint, but excellent old English: "Of Apes," he says, "there are infinite
flocks up and down in the mountains, a thousand and more together, and they
leave no stone unturned. If they meet with one that two or three cannot
lift they call for more aid, and all for the sake of the Worms that lye
under, a sort of dyet which they relish exceedingly. They are very greedy
after Emmets. So that having found an emmet hill, they presently surround
it, and laying their fore paws with the hollow downward upon the ant heap,
as soon as the Emmets creep into their treacherous palms they lick 'em off,
with great comfort to their stomachs. And there they will lye till there is
not an Emmet left. They are also pernicious to fruits and apples, and will
destroy whole fields and gardens unless they be looked after. For they are
very cunning, and will never venture in till the return of their spies,
which they send always before, who, giving all information that it is safe,
in they rush with their whole body and make a quick despatch. Therefore
they go very quiet and silent to their prey; and if their young ones chance
to make a noise, they chastise them with their fists; but if the coast is
clear, then every one has a different noise to express his joy." Ludolf
clearly means the baboons by this description.

A more ancient story deals with Alexander's campaigns. He encamped on a
mountain on which were numerous bands of monkeys (probably baboons). On the
following morning the sentries saw what looked like troops coming to offer
them battle. As they had just won a victory, they were at a loss to guess
who these new foes might he. The alarm was given, and the Macedonian troops
set out in battle-array. Then through the morning mists they saw that the
enemy was an immense troop of monkeys. Their prisoners, who knew what the
alarm was caused by, made no small sport of the Macedonians.

THE SPEECH OF MONKEYS.

Something should be said of the alleged "speech of monkeys" which Professor
Garner believed himself to have discovered. He rightly excluded mere sounds
showing joy, desire, or sorrow from the faculty of speech, but claimed to
have detected special words, one meaning "food," another "drink," another
"give me that," another meaning "monkey," or an identification of a second
animal or monkey. He used a phonograph to keep permanent record of the
sounds, and made an expedition to the West African forests in the hope that
he might induce the large anthropoid apes to answer the sounds which are so
often uttered by their kind in our menageries. The enterprise ended, as
might have been expected, in failure. Nor was it in the least necessary to
go and sit in a cage in an African forest in the hope of striking up an
acquaintance with the native chimpanzees. The little Capuchin monkeys,
whose voices and sounds he had ample opportunity of observing here, give
sufficient material for trying experiments in the meaning of monkey sounds.
The writer believes that it is highly probable that the cleverer monkeys
have a great many notes or sounds which the others do understand, if only
because they make the same under similar circumstances, otherwise they
would not utter them. They are like the sounds which an intelligent but
nearly dumb person might make. Also they have very sharp ears, and some of
them can understand musical sounds, so far as to show a very marked
attention to them. The following account of an experiment of this kind,
when a violin was being played, is related in "Life at the Zoo": "The
Capuchin monkeys, the species selected by Professor Garner for his
experiments in monkey language, showed the strangest and most amusing
excitement. These pretty little creatures have very expressive and
intelligent faces, and the play and mobility of their faces and voices
while listening to the music were extraordinarily rapid. The three in the
first cage at once rushed up into their box, and then all peeped out,
chattering and excited. One by one they came down, and listened to the
music with intense curiosity, shrieking and making faces at a crescendo,
shaking the wires angrily at a discord, and putting their heads almost
upside-down in efforts at acute criticism at low and musical passages.
Every change of note was marked by some alteration of expression in the
faces of the excited little monkeys, and a series of discordant notes
roused them to a passion of rage." At the same time a big baboon, chained
up near, evidently disliked it. He walked off in the opposite direction to
the farthest limits of his chain.

THE NEW WORLD MONKEYS.

Mention of the Capuchins takes us to the whole group of the New World
Monkeys. Nearly all of these live in the tropical forests of Brazil,
Guiana, Venezuela, and Mexico. They are all different from the Old World
monkeys, and many are far more beautiful. The most attractive of the
hardier kinds are the Capuchins; but there are many kinds of rare and
delicate little monkeys more beautiful than any squirrel, which would make
the most delightful pets in the world, if they were not so delicate. To try
to describe the Old World monkeys in separate groups from end to end is
rather a hopeless task. But the American monkeys are more manageable by the
puzzled amateur. Most of them have a broad and marked division between the
nostrils, which are not mere slits close together, but like the nostrils of
men. They also have human-looking rounded heads. Their noses are of the
"cogitative" order, instead of being snouts or snubs with narrow openings
in them; and the whole face is in many ways human and intelligent. The
HOWLER MONKEYS, which utter the most hideous sounds ever heard in the
forests, and the SPIDER MONKEYS are the largest. The latter have the most
wonderfully developed limbs and tails for catching and climbing of any
living animals. As highly specialised creatures are always interesting,
visitors to any zoological garden will find it worth while to watch a
spider monkey climbing, just as it is always worth while to watch a great
snake on the move. The tail is used as a fifth hand: the Indians of Brazil
say they catch fish with it, which is not true. But if you watch a spider
monkey moving from tree to tree, his limbs and tail move like the five
fingers of a star-fish. Each of the extremities is as sensitive as a hand,
far longer in proportion than an ordinary man's arm, and apparently able to
work independently of joints. The monkey can do so many things at once that
no juggler can equal it. It will hold fruit in one hand, pick more with one
foot, place food to the mouth with another hand, and walk and swing from
branch to branch with the other foot and tail, all simultaneously. These
monkeys have no visible thumb, though dissection shows that they have a
rudimentary one; but the limbs are so flexible that they can put one arm
round behind their heads over on to the opposite shoulder, and brush the
fur on their upper arm. The end of the tail seems always "feeling" the air
or surroundings, and has hairs, thin and long, at the end, which aid it in
knowing when it is near a leaf or branch. It is almost like the tentacle of
some sea zoophyte. Gentle creatures, all of them, are these spider monkeys.
One of them, of the species called Waita, when kept in captivity, wore the
fur off its forehead by rubbing its long gaunt arms continually over its
brow whenever it was scolded. The spider monkeys differ only in the degree
of spidery slenderness in their limbs. In disposition they are always
amiable, and in habits tree-climbers and fruit-eaters.

This monkey is specially adapted for arboreal life. The tail acts as a

The CAPUCHINS are, in the writer's opinion, the nicest of all monkeys. Many
species are known, but all have the same round merry faces, bright eyes,
pretty fur, and long tails. There is always a fair number at the Zoological
Gardens. They are merry, but full of fads. One hates children and loves
ladies; another adores one or two other monkeys, and screams at the rest.
All are fond of insects as well as of fruit. A friend of the writer kept
one in a large house in Leicestershire. It was not very good-tempered, but
most amusing, climbing up the blind-cord first, and catching and eating the
flies on the window-panes most dexterously, always avoiding the wasps. This
monkey was taught to put out a lighted paper (a useful accomplishment) by
dashing its hands on to the burning part, or, if the paper were twisted up,
by taking the unlighted end and beating the burning part on the ground; and
it was very fond of turning the leaves of any large book. This it did not
only by vigorous use of both arms and hands, but by putting its head under
too, and "heaving" the leaves over.

In the private room behind the monkey-house at the Zoo there are always a
number of the rare and delicate monkeys from the New World, which cannot
stand the draughts of the outer house, like the Capuchins and spider
monkeys. The greater number of these come from tropical America. There, in
the mighty forests, so lofty that no man can climb the trees, so dense that
there is a kind of upper storey on the interlaced tree-tops, where nearly
all the birds and many mammals live without descending to earth, forests in
which there is neither summer nor winter, but only the changes from hour to
hour of the equatorial day, the exquisite MARMOSETS, whose fur looks like
the plumage and whose twittering voices imitate the notes of birds, live
and have their being. They are all much alike in shape, except that the
LION MARMOSET'S mane is like that of a little lion clad in floss silk; and
they all have sharp little claws, and feed on insects. The PINCHÉ MARMOSET
from the Guiana forests has a face like a black Indian chief, with white
plumes over his head and neck like those worn by a "brave" in full
war-paint. Merchants who do business with Brazil very frequently import
marmosets and the closely allied tamarins as presents for friends in
England; the Brazilians themselves like to have them as pets also; so there
is to some extent a trade demand for them.

WANDEROO MONKEY.

The number of monkeys which have leonine manes is large. The manes act as
capes to keep the dew and wet from their chests and shoulders.]

Among the most delicate of American monkeys are the OUKARIS, which have
somewhat human faces, exquisite soft fur, and are as gentle as most of
these forest creatures. They seldom live long in captivity, a few months
being as much as they will generally endure, even in Brazil. Perhaps the
rarest of all is the white-haired SCARLET-FACED OUKARI. This monkey has
long white hair from neck to tail, sandy whiskers, and a bright scarlet
face. It lives in a district of partly flooded forest, and is only obtained
by the Indians using blow-pipes and arrows dipped in very diluted urari
poison. The WHITE-HEADED SAKI is a rare and very pretty little monkey of
Brazil; and there are a very large number of other species of this group
whose names it would be mere weariness to mention. All these small monkeys
are very quick and intelligent, while the rapidity of their movements,
their ever-changing expression, and sharp, eager cries heighten the idea of
cleverness given by their general appearance. Other little imps of these
forests are the SQUIRREL MONKEYS. In the common species the face is like a
little furry man's, its arms brilliant yellow (as if dipped in gamboge
dye), the cheeks pink, and eyes black. In habits it is a quick-tempered,
imperious little creature, carnivorous, and a great devourer of butterflies
and beetles.

COMMON SQUIRREL MONKEY.

The squirrel monkeys have soft, bright-coloured fur, and long, hairy tails.
They are found from Mexico to Paraguay.]

The most beautiful and entertaining of all monkeys are these New World
species. No person clever at interpreting the ways of animals would fail to
consider them far more clever and sympathetic than the melancholy
anthropoid apes, while for appearance they have no equals. Probably the
most attractive monkey in Europe is a South American one now in the London
Zoological Gardens. It was first mentioned to Europeans by Baron von
Humboldt, who saw it in the cabin of an Indian on the Orinoco. These forest
Indians of South America are gentle creatures themselves. Among other
amiable qualities, they have a passion for keeping pets. One who worked for
a friend of the writer, with others of his tribe, was asked what he would
take in payment, which was given in kind. The others chose cloth, axes,
etc. This Indian said that he did not care for any of these things. He said
he wanted a "poosa." No one knew what he meant. He signed that he wished to
go to the house and would show them. Arrived there, he pointed to the cat!
"Pussy," to the Arawak Indian, was a "poosa," and that was what he wanted
as a month's wages. Humboldt's Indian had something better than a "poosa."
It was a monkey, as black as coal, with a round head, long thickly furred
tail, and bright vivacious eyes. The explorer called it the LAGOTHRIX,
which means Hare-skin Monkey. The fur is not the least like a hare's, but
much resembles that of an opossum. The more suitable name is the WOOLLY
MONKEY. The one kept at the Gardens is a most friendly and vivacious
creature, ready to embrace, play and make friends with any well-dressed
person. It dislikes people in working-clothes which are dirty or soiled--a
not uncommon aversion of clever animals.

HUMBOLDT'S WOOLLY MONKEY.

This is the most popular monkey in England. He looks for all the world like
a Negro, and has a most beautiful, soft, woolly coat. He is very tame, and
loves nothing better than being petted.]

In spite of all the varieties of _temperament_ in the monkey tribe, from
the genial little Capuchins to the morose old baboon, they nearly all have
one thing in common--that is, the monkey brain. The same curious
restlessness, levity, and want of concentration mark them all, except the
large anthropoid apes. Some of these have without doubt power of reflection
and concentration which the other monkeys do not possess. But in all the
rest, though the capacity for understanding exists, the wish to please, as
a dog does, and the desire to remember and to retain what it has learnt,
seem almost entirely wanting. Egoism, which is a sign of human dementia, is
a very leading characteristic of all monkeys. There is no doubt that the
baboons might be trained to be useful animals if they always served one
master. Le Vaillant and many other travellers have noted this. But they are
_too clever_, and at the bottom too ill-tempered ever to be trustworthy,
even regarded as "watches," or to help in minor manual labour. Baboons
would make an excellent substitute for dogs as used in Belgium for light
draught; but no one could ever rely on their behaving themselves when their
master's eye was elsewhere.

Taken as a family, the monkeys are a feeble and by no means likeable race.
They are "undeveloped" as a class, full of promise, but with no
performance.

Most of the smaller monkeys, as well as the baboons, are fond of eating

THE LEMURS.

The South American monkeys, with their squirrel-like forms and fur, are
followed by a beautiful and interesting group of creatures, called the
LEMURS, with their cousins the Lorises, Maholis, and Pottos. Their
resemblance to monkeys is mainly in their hands and feet. These are real
and very highly developed hands, with proper thumbs. The second toe on the
hind foot nearly always terminates in a long, sharp claw. "Elia," the
Indian naturalist, who kept them as pets, noticed that they used this to
scratch themselves with. Some of them have the finger-tips expanded into a
sensitive disk, full of extra nerves. Lemur means "ghost." Unlike the
lively squirrels and monkeys, they do not leave their hiding-places till
the tropical darkness has fallen on the forest, when they seek their food,
not by descending to the ground, but by ascending to the upper surface of
the ocean of trees, and again, at the first approach of dawn, seek refuge
from the light in the recesses of some dark and hollow trunk. The
RING-TAILED LEMUR is as lively by day as night; but most of the race are so
entirely creatures of darkness that the light seems to stupefy them. When
wakened, they turn over like sleeping children, with the same inarticulate
cries and deep, uneasy sighs. But at night most are astonishingly active;
they fly from tree to tree, heard, but invisible; so that the natives of
Madagascar doubt whether they are not true _lemures_, the unquiet ghosts of
their departed dead.

Though the lemurs are here treated apart from the other animals of
Madagascar, it will be obvious that they are a curious and abnormal tribe.
This is true of most of the animals of that great island, which has a fauna
differing both from that of the adjacent coast of Africa and from that of
India or Australia. In the FOSSA, a large representative of the Civets, it
possesses a species absolutely unlike any other. The Aye-aye is also an
abnormal creature. Nor must it be forgotten that Madagascar was until
recently the home of some of the gigantic ground-living birds. But, after
all, none of its inhabitants are more remarkable than its hosts of lemurs,
some of which are to be met with in almost every coppice in the island.
There are also many extinct kinds.

Exquisite fur, soft and beautifully tinted, eyes of extraordinary size and
colour (for the pupil shuts up to a mere black line by day, and the rest of
the eye shows like a polished stone of rich brown or yellow or
marble-grey), are the marks of most of the lemurs. But there are other
lemur-like creatures, or "lemuroids," which, though endowed with the same
lovely fur, like softest moss, have no tails. The strangest of all are two
creatures called the SLENDER LORIS and the SLOW LORIS. The slender loris,
which has the ordinary furry coat of the lemurs, and no tail, moves on the
branches exactly as does a chameleon. Each hand or foot is slowly raised,
brought forward, and set down again. The fingers then as slowly close on
the branch till its grasp is secure. It is like a slow-working mechanical
toy. Probably this is a habit, now instinctive, gained by ages of
cautiously approaching insects. But the result is to give the impression
that the creature is almost an automaton.

A DWARF LEMUR.

These tiny animals take the place of the dormouse in Madagascar.]

Madagascar is the main home of the lemurs, though some of the related
animals are also found in Africa and in the East Indies. But the dense
forests of the great island are full of these curious nocturnal beasts, of
which there are so many varieties presenting very slight differences of
form and habit, that naturalists have some difficulty in giving even a
complete list of their species. Add to this that nearly all of them are
intensely and entirely nocturnal, and the scarcity of data as to their
habits is easily accounted for. When seen by us, their faces all lack
expression--that is to say, the eyes, which mainly give expression, seem
entirely vacant and meaningless. But this is due to their special
adaptation to seeing in the dark tropical night. By day the pupil of the
eye almost disappears. If only we could also see in the dark, the eyes of
the lemur might have as much expression as those of a faithful dog. The
change which night makes in their general demeanour is simply miraculous.
By day many of them are like hibernating animals, almost incapable of
movement. When once the curtain of night has fallen, they are as active as
squirrels, and as full of play as a family of kittens. The RING-TAILED
LEMUR is often kept as a pet, both in Madagascar and in the Mauritius. It
is one of the very few which are diurnal in their habits. When in a hurry
it jumps along, standing on its hind feet, like a little kangaroo, but
holding its tail upright behind its back. It will follow people upstairs in
this way, jumping from step to step, with its front paws outstretched, as
if it were addressing an audience. The French call these day lemurs MAKIS.
The ring-tailed lemur lives largely among rocks and precipices. Most of
these creatures live upon fruit, the shoots and leaves of trees, and other
vegetable food. But, like the squirrel, they have no objection to eggs and
nestlings, and also kill and eat any small birds and insects. Some of the
smaller kinds are almost entirely insect-feeders. The largest kind of lemur
belongs to the group known as the INDRIS. The BLACK-AND-WHITE INDRI
measures about 2 feet in length. It has only a rudimentary tail, large
ears, and a sharp-pointed nose. The amount of white colouring varies much
in different individuals. This variation in colouring--a very rare feature
among wild mammalia, though one of the first changes shown when animals are
domesticated--is also found in the next three species, called SIFAKAS. The
DIADEMED SIFAKA, the WOOLLY INDRI, and the BLACK INDRI all belong to this
group. The SIFAKAS, as some of these and the allied forms are called, are
venerated by the Malagasys, who never kill one intentionally. Mr. Foster
observes that "they live in companies of six or eight, and are very gentle
and inoffensive animals, wearing a very melancholy expression, and being as
a rule morose, inactive, and more silent than the other lemurs. They rarely
live long in captivity. In their native state they are most alert in the
morning and evening, as during the day they conceal themselves under the
foliage of trees. When asleep or in repose, the head is dropped on the
chest and buried between the arms, the tail rolled up on itself and
disposed between the hind legs. The sifakas live exclusively on vegetable
substances, fruits, leaves, and flowers, their diet not being varied, as in
the other lemurs, by small birds, eggs, or insects. Their life is almost
entirely arboreal, for which the muscles of their hands and feet, as well
as the parachute-like folds between their arms and bodies, and their
peculiar hooked fingers, are well fitted. The young one is carried by the
mother on its back, its hands grasping her armpits tightly."

This is not the universal way of carrying the young among lemurs. The
CROWNED LEMUR, a beautiful grey-and-white species, often breeds at the Zoo.
The female carries its young one partly on its side. The infant clings
tightly with arms and tail round the very slender waist of the lemur, and
pushes out its sharp little face just above the thigh of the mother. The
WOOLLY INDRI has more woolly fur than the others of its tribe, a shorter
nose, and a longer tail.

THE TRUE LEMURS

Of these there are several species, all confined to Madagascar and the
Comoro Islands. One of the best known is the RING-TAILED LEMUR, mentioned
above. It is called LEMUR CATTA, the Cat Lemur, from being so often kept in
domestication. The WEASEL LEMUR, the GREY LEMUR, the MOUSE LEMUR, the
GENTLE LEMUR, the SPORTIVE LEMUR, the CROWNED LEMUR, and COQUEREL'S LEMUR,
all represent various small, pretty, and interesting varieties of the
group. The BLACK-AND-WHITE LEMUR, one of the larger kinds, is capable of
domestication. A specimen kept in a London house, where the present writer
saw it, was always called "Pussy" by the children. The other small kinds
are very like squirrels, mice, weasels, and other creatures, with which
they have no connection. It seems as though the curiously limited and
primitive fauna of Madagascar tried to make up for its want of variety by
mimicking the forms of other animals, and something of the same kind is
seen in Australia, where the marsupials take the place of all kinds of
ordinary mammals. There are marsupial rats, marsupial wolves, marsupial
squirrels, and even marsupial moles. The small squirrel and rat-like lemurs
are called CHIROGALES. COQUEREL'S LEMUR is really a chirogale. It is a
quaint and by no means amiable little animal, sleeping obstinately all day,
and always ready to growl and bite if disturbed. Its colour is brownish
grey and cream-colour. A pair of these, rolled up tightly into balls in a
box of hay, will absolutely refuse to move, even when handled. They only
feed by night.


THE GALAGOS.

MAHOLI GALAGO

This little animal is a native of East Africa. It has very large eyes, and
fur as soft as the chinchilla's.]

An allied group, confined to tropical Africa, is that of the GALAGOS. They
are most beautiful little creatures, whose nearest relatives are the
Malagasy lemurs. Generally speaking, they have even more exquisite fur than
the lemurs. It is almost as soft as floss silk, and so close that the hand
sinks into it as into a bed of moss. The colour of the fur is rich and
pleasing, generally some shade of brown. The head is small, the nose
pointed, and the ears thin, hairless, and capable of being folded up, like
the wings of a beetle. But the most beautiful feature of the galagos is
their eyes. These are of immense size, compared with the head. The eye is
of the richest and most beautiful brown, like a cairngorm stone, but not
glassy or clear. Though quite translucent, the eye is marked with minute
dividing-lines, like the grain in an agate--a truly exquisite object. When
handled or taken in the arms, the little galago clasps the fingers or
sleeve tightly, as if it thought it was holding a tree, and shows no
disposition to escape. A family of three or four young ones, no larger than
mice, with their large-eyed mother attending to them, forms an exquisitely
dainty little group. The galagos vary from the size of a squirrel to that
of a small cat. The kind most often seen in England is the Maholi GALAGO
from East Africa. Another species comes from Senegal, and others from
Calabar and the forests of the Gold Coast. GARNETT'S GALAGO, another
species, is shown above. They may be regarded as nocturnal tropical
lemuroids, analogous to the chirogales of Madagascar. It has been
suggested, with great probability, that the intensely drowsy sleep of many
of the lemuroid animals corresponds to the hibernation of many northern
mammals. Tropical animals often become torpid to avoid the famine caused by
the hot season, just as creatures in cold countries hibernate to avoid the
hunger which would otherwise come with winter.


THE SLOW LEMURS OR LORISES, AND TARSIERS.

Another group of lemuroids is distinguished from the foregoing by having
the second finger of the fore paws either very short or rudimentary. The
thumb and great toe are also set very widely apart from the other fingers
and toes. A far more striking distinction to the non-scientific eye is
their astonishingly deliberate and slow movements. They have no tails,
enormous eyes, and very long, slender legs.

The SLOW LORIS is found in Eastern India and the Malay countries, where it
is fairly common in the forests. The Bengali natives call it _sharmindi
billi_ ("bashful cat"), from its slow, solemn, hesitating movements when in
pursuit of insects. Of a slow loris kept by him, Sir William Jones, in the
"Asiatic Researches," wrote: "At all times he seemed pleased at being
stroked on the head and throat, and he frequently allowed me to touch his
extremely sharp teeth. But his temper was always quick, and when he was
unseasonably disturbed he expressed a little resentment, by an obscure
murmur, like that of a squirrel.... When a grasshopper or any insect
alighted within his reach, his eyes, as he fixed them on his prey, glowed
with uncommon fire; and having drawn himself back to spring on his prey
with greater force, he seized it with both his fore paws, and held it till
he had devoured it. He never could have enough grasshoppers, and spent the
whole night in prowling for them."

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

SLENDER LORIS.

This extraordinary creature has the habits of a chameleon when seeking
insects for food. The photograph is unique.]

The SLENDER LORIS, an equally curious creature, is only found in Southern
India and Ceylon. Its food consists entirely of insects, which it captures
by gradual, almost paralysed approach. It has been described as a
"furry-coated chameleon." A group of slow lemurs, living in Western Africa,
are known as Pottos. They are odd little quadrupeds, in which the
"forefinger" never grows to be more than a stump. The tail is also either
sharp or rudimentary. They are as slow as the lorises in their movements.

In the Malay islands a distant relative, even more curiously formed, is
found in the TARSIER. It has the huge eyes, pointed ears, and beautiful fur
of the galagos, but the tail is long, thin, and tufted. The fingers are
flattened out into disks, like a tree-frog's. These creatures hop from
bough to bough in a frog-like manner in search of insects. They are not so
large as a good-sized rat. Our photograph does not give an adequate idea of
the size of the eyes.

SLOW LORIS.

Another of the slow-moving loris group. These animals are not shown to the
general public at the Zoo, but kept in a specially warmed room.]


THE AYE-AYE.

Last, and most remarkable of all these weird lemuroids, is the AYE-AYE. It
is placed in a group by itself, and has teeth like those of the Rodents, a
large bushy tail, and most extraordinarily long, slender fingers, which it
probably uses for picking caterpillars and grubs out of rotten wood. It is
nearly as large as an Arctic fox, but its habits are those of a lemur. In
Madagascar it haunts the bamboo forests, feeding on the juice of
sugar-cane, grubs, and insects. The fingers of its hands are of different
sizes and lengths, though all are abnormally long and slender. The second
finger seems to have "wasted," but is said to be of the utmost value to its
owner in extracting grubs and insects from the burrows in which they dwell,
or the crannies in which they may have taken refuge. Very seldom is this
animal seen alive in captivity. Although commonly called Aye-aye in this
country, it is doubtful if this is really its native name. The aye-aye was
long a puzzle to naturalists, but is now classed as a lemuroid.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

These little animals hop about in the trees like frogs. They are nocturnal,
and seldom seen.]



THE living races of animals have thus far been reviewed along the completed
list of the first great order--the Primates. Even in that circumscribed
group how great is the tendency to depart from the main type, and how
wonderful the adaptation to meet the various needs of the creatures'
environment! The skeletons, the frames on which these various beings are
built up, remain the same in character; but the differences of proportion
in the limbs, of the muscles with which they are equipped, and of the
weight of the bodies to be moved are astonishing. Compare, for instance,
the head of the male Gorilla, with its great ridges of bone, to which are
attached the muscles which enable it to devour hard tropical fruits and
bite off young saplings and bamboos, with the rounded and delicate head of
the Insect-eating Monkeys of South Africa; or set side by side the hand of
the Chimpanzee with that of the Aye-aye, with its delicate, slender
fingers, like those of a skeleton hand. What could be more diverse than the
movements of these creatures, whose structure is nevertheless so much
alike? Some of the lemuroids are as active as squirrels, flying lightly
from branch to branch; in others, as the Slow Lorises, the power of rapid
movement has disappeared, and been replaced by a creeping gait which cannot
be accelerated. Already, in a single order, we see the rich diversity of
nature, and its steady tendency to make all existing things serviceable by
adapting other parts of creation to their use or enjoyment.

CHAPTER II.

_THE CAT TRIBE._

Though only one species is entirely domesticated, and none of the Cats have
flesh edible by man, except perhaps the puma, no group of animals has
attracted more interest than this. Containing more than forty species,
ranging in size from the ox-devouring tiger or lion to the small wild cats,
they are so alike in habit and structure that no one could possibly mistake
the type or go far wrong in guessing at the habits of any one of them. They
are all flesh-eaters and destroyers of living animals. All have rounded
heads, and an extraordinary equipment of teeth and of claws, and of muscles
to use them. The blow of the forearm of a lion or tiger is inconceivably
powerful, in proportion to its size. A stroke from a tiger's paw has been
known to strike off a native's arm from the shoulder and leave it hanging
by a piece of skin, and a similar blow from a lion to crush the skull of an
ox. The true cats are known by the power to draw back, or "retract," their
claws into sheaths of horn, rendering their footsteps noiseless, and
keeping these weapons always sharp. The hunting-leopard has only a partial
capacity for doing this.

[Illustration: _By permission of Herr Carl Hagenbeck, Hamburg._

AN UNWILLING PUPIL.

This is one of Herr Hagenbeck s famous performing tigers.]

The characteristics of the Cats and their allies are too well known to need
description. We will therefore only mention the chief types of the group,
and proceed to give, in the fullest detail which space allows, authentic
anecdotes of their life and habits. The tribe includes Lions, Tigers,
Leopards, Pumas, Jaguars, a large number of so-called Tiger-cats (spotted
and striped), Wild Cats, Domestic Cats, and Lynxes. The Hunting-leopard, or
Cheeta, stands in a sub-group by itself, as does the Fossa, the only large
carnivore of Madagascar. This closes the list of the most cat-like animals.
The next links in the chain are formed by the Civets and Genets, creatures
with more or less retractile claws, and long, bushy tails; the still less
cat-like Binturong, a creature with a prehensile tail; and the Mongooses
and Ichneumons, more and more nearly resembling the weasel tribe.


THE LION.

Recent intrusions for railways, sport, discovery, and war into Central and
East Africa have opened up new lion countries, and confirmed, in the most
striking manner, the stories of the power, the prowess, and the dreadful
destructiveness to man and beast of this king of the Carnivora. At present
it is found in Persia, on the same rivers where Nimrod and the Assyrian
kings made its pursuit their royal sport; in Gujerat, where it is nearly
extinct, though in General Price's work on Indian game written before the
middle of the last century it is stated that a cavalry officer killed
eighty lions in three years; and in Africa, from Algeria to the Bechuana
country. It is especially common in Somaliland, where the modern
lion-hunter mainly seeks his sport. On the Uganda Railway, from Mombasa to
Lake Victoria, lions are very numerous and dangerous. In Rhodesia and the
Northern Transvaal they have killed hunters, railway officials, and even
our soldiers near Komati Poort. It has been found that whole tracts of
country are still often deserted by their inhabitants from fear of lions,
and that the accounts of their ravages contained in the Old Testament,
telling how Samaria was almost deserted a second time from this cause,
might be paralleled to-day.

THE AFRICAN LION.

BY F. C. SELOUS.

When, in the latter half of the seventeenth century, Europeans first
settled at the Cape of Good Hope, the lion's roar was probably to be heard
almost nightly on the slopes of Table Mountain, since a quaint entry in the
Diary of Van Riebeck, the first Dutch governor of the Cape, runs thus:
"This night the lions roared as if they would take the fort by storm"--the
said fort being situated on the site of the city now known as Cape Town.

At that date there can be little doubt that, excepting in the waterless
deserts and the dense equatorial forests, lions roamed over the whole of
the vast continent of Africa from Cape Agulhas to the very shore of the
Mediterranean Sea; nor was their range very seriously curtailed until the
spread of European settlements in North and South Africa, and the
acquisition of firearms by the aboriginal inhabitants of many parts of the
country, during the latter half of the nineteenth century, steadily denuded
large areas of all wild game.

ALGERIAN LIONESS.

This lioness, sitting under an olive-tree, was actually photographed in the
Soudan by the intrepid M. Geiser.]

As the game vanished, the lions disappeared too; for although at first they
preyed to a large extent on the domestic flocks and herds which gradually
replaced the wild denizens of the once-uninhabited plains, this practice
brought them into conflict with the white colonists or native herdsmen
armed with weapons of precision, before whom they rapidly succumbed.

A PERFORMING LION.

Lions, it would seem, are capable of being taught almost anything, even
tricycle-riding.]

To-day lions are still to be found wherever game exists in any quantity,
and their numbers will be in proportion to those of the wild animals on
which they prey.

The indefinite increase of lions must be checked by some unknown law of
nature, otherwise they would have become so numerous in the sparsely
inhabited or altogether uninhabited parts of Africa, that they would first
have exterminated all the game on which they had been wont to prey, and
would then have had to starve or to have eaten one another. But such a
state of things has never been known to occur; and whenever Europeans have
entered a previously unexplored and uninhabited tract of country in Africa,
and have found it teeming with buffaloes, zebras, and antelopes, they have
always found lions in such districts very plentiful indeed, but never in
such numbers as to seriously diminish the abundance of the game upon which
they depended for food.

LIONESS AND CUB.

Lion cubs thrive both in Dublin and Amsterdam, but not so well at the
London Zoo.]

It is easy to understand that the increase of a herd of herbivorous animals
would be regulated by the amount of the food-supply available, as well as
constantly checked by the attacks of the large carnivora, such as lions,
leopards, cheetas, hyænas, and wild dogs; but I have never been able to
comprehend what has kept within bounds the inordinate increase of lions and
other carnivorous animals in countries where for ages past they have had an
abundant food-supply, and at the same time, having been almost entirely
unmolested by human beings, have had no enemies. Perhaps such a state of
things does not exist at the present day, but there are many parts of
Africa where such conditions have existed from time immemorial up to within
quite recent years.

Since lions were once to be found over the greater portion of the vast
continent of Africa, it is self-evident that these animals are able to
accommodate themselves to great variations of climate and surroundings; and
I myself have met with them, close to the sea, in the hot and sultry
coastlands of South-east Africa; on the high plateau of Mashonaland, where
at an altitude of 6,000 feet above sea-level the winter nights are cold and
frosty; amongst the stony hills to the east of the Victoria Falls of the
Zambesi; and in the swamps of the Chobi. In the great reed-beds of the
latter river a certain number of lions appeared to live constantly, preying
on buffaloes and lechwe antelopes. I often heard them roaring at nights in
these swamps, and I once saw two big male lions wading slowly across an
open space between two beds of reeds in water nearly a foot in depth.

A YOUNG LIONESS.

Although there are great individual differences in lions as regards size,
general colour of coat, and more particularly in the length, colour, and
profuseness of the mane with which the males are adorned, yet as these
differences occur in every part of Africa where lions are met with, and
since constant varieties with one fixed type of mane living by themselves
and not interbreeding with other varieties do not exist anywhere, modern
zoologists are, I think, now agreed that there is only one species of lion,
since in any large series of wild lion skins, made in any particular
district of Africa or Asia, every gradation will be found between the
finest-maned specimens and those which are destitute of any mane at all.
Several local races have, however, been recently described by German
writers.

In the hot and steamy coastlands of tropical Africa lions usually have
short manes, and never, I believe, attain the long silky black manes
sometimes met with on the high plateaux of the interior. However, there is,
I believe, no part of Africa where all or even the majority of male lions
carry heavy manes, the long hair of which does not as a rule cover more
than the neck and chest, with a tag of varying length and thickness
extending from the back of the neck to between the shoulder-blades. Lions
with very full black manes, covering the whole shoulders, are rare
anywhere, but more likely to be encountered on the high plateaux, where the
winter nights are extremely cold, than anywhere else. In such cases, in
addition to the tufts of hair always found on the elbows and in the armpits
of lions with fair-sized manes, there will probably be large tufts of hair
in each flank just where the thighs join the belly; but I have never yet
seen the skin of a lion shot within the last thirty years with the whole
belly covered with long, thick hair, as may constantly be observed in lions
kept in captivity in the menageries of Europe. There is, however, some
evidence to show that, when lions existed on the high plains of the Cape
Colony and the Orange River Colony, where the winter nights are much colder
than in the countries farther north where lions may still be encountered,
certain individuals of the species developed a growth of long hair all over
the belly, as well as an extraordinary luxuriance of mane on the neck and
shoulders.

A HAPPY FAMILY.

Here is a group of animals and their keeper from Herr Hagenbeck's
Thierpark. The animal in front is a cross between a lion and a tigress; he
lives on quite friendly terms with his keeper, and also with lions, tigers,
and leopards, as seen in the photograph.]

A CROSS BETWEEN LION AND TIGRESS.

This unique photograph shows a remarkable hybrid and its proud parents. The
father (on the right) is a lion, and the mother (on the left) a tigress.
The offspring (in the centre) is a fine, large male, now four years old; it
is bigger than an average-sized lion or tiger.]

From the foregoing remarks it will be seen that wild lions, having as a
rule much less luxuriant manes than many examples of their kind to be seen
in European menageries, are ordinarily not so majestic and dignified in
appearance as many of their caged relatives. On the other hand, the wild
lion is a much more alert and active animal than a menagerie specimen, and
when in good condition is far better built and more powerful-looking, being
free from all appearance of lankiness and weakness in the legs, and having
strong, well-formed hindquarters. The eyes of the menagerie lion, too, look
brown and usually sleepy, whilst those of the wild animal are yellow, and
extraordinarily luminous even after death. When wounded and standing at
bay, with head held low between his shoulders, growling hoarsely, and with
twitching tail, even if he is not near enough to be observed very closely,
a lion looks a very savage and dangerous animal; but should he be wounded
in such a way as to admit of a near approach--perhaps by a shot that has
paralysed his hindquarters--his flaming eyes will seem to throw out sparks
of living fire.

LIONESS AND TIGER.

Speaking generally, there is little or no danger in meeting a lion or lions
in the daytime. Even in parts of the country where firearms are unknown,
and where the natives seldom or never interfere with them, these animals
seem to have an instinctive fear of man, and even when encountered at the
carcase of an animal freshly killed, and at a time when they may be
supposed to be hungry, they will almost invariably retreat before the
unwelcome presence, sometimes slowly and sulkily, but in districts where
much hunting with firearms has been going on at a very rapid pace. However,
I have known of two cases of Europeans mounted on horseback having been
attacked by lions in broad daylight, and Dr. Livingstone mentions a third.
In one of the instances which came within my own knowledge, a lion sprang
at a Boer hunter as he was riding slowly along, carrying an elephant-gun in
his right hand and followed by a string of natives on foot. The lion
attacked from the left side, and with its right paw seized my friend from
behind by the right side of his face and neck, inflicting deep gashes with
its sharp claws, one of which cut right through his cheek and tore out one
of his teeth. My friend was pulled from his horse, but, clutching the
loosely girthed saddle tightly with his knees, it twisted round under the
horse's belly before he fell to the ground. Instead of following up its
success, the lion, probably scared by the shouting of the Kaffirs, trotted
away for a short distance, and then turned and stood looking at the
dismounted hunter, who, never having lost his presence of mind, immediately
shot it dead with his heavy old muzzle-loading elephant-gun. Besides these
three instances of Europeans having been attacked in the daytime by lions,
I have known of a certain number of natives having been killed in broad
daylight. Such incidents are, however, by no means every-day occurrences,
and, speaking generally, it may be said that the risk of molestation by
lions in Africa during daylight is very small. It is by night that lions
roam abroad with stealthy step in search of prey; and at such times they
are often, when hungry, incredibly bold and daring. I have known them upon
several occasions to enter a hunter's camp, and, regardless of fires, to
seize oxen and horses and human beings.

During the year following the first occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, a
great deal of damage was done by lions, which could not resist the
attractions of the settlers' live stock. For the first few months I kept as
accurate an account as I could of the number of horses, donkeys, oxen,
sheep, goats, and pigs which were killed by lions, and it soon mounted up
to over 200 head. During the same time several white men were also mauled
by lions, and one unfortunate man named Teale was dragged from beneath the
cart, where he was sleeping by the side of a native driver, and at once
killed and eaten. Several of the horses were killed inside rough shelters
serving as stables. In the following year (1891) over 100 pigs were killed
in one night by a single lioness. These pigs were in a series of pens,
separated one from another, but all under one low thatched roof. The
lioness forced her way in between two poles, and apparently was unable,
after having satisfied her hunger, to find her way out again, and, becoming
angry and frightened, wandered backwards and forwards through the pens,
killing almost all the pigs, each one with a bite at the back of the head
or neck. This lioness, which had only eaten portions of two young pigs,
made her escape before daylight, but was killed with a set gun the next
night by the owner of the pigs.

TIGRESS.

Were the grass seen here the normal height of that in the Indian jungles,
the upright lines would harmonize with the stripes, and render the tiger
almost invisible.]

When lions grow old, they are always liable to become man-eaters. Finding
their strength failing them, and being no longer able to hunt and pull down
large antelopes or zebras, they are driven by hunger to killing small
animals, such as porcupines, and even tortoises, or they may visit a native
village and catch a goat, or kill a child or woman going for water; and
finding a human being a very easy animal to catch and kill, an old lion
which has once tasted human flesh will in all probability continue to be a
man-eater until he is killed. On this subject, in his "Missionary Travels,"
Dr. Livingstone says: "A man-eater is invariably an old lion; and when he
overcomes his fear of man so far as to come to villages for goats, the
people remark, 'His teeth are worn; he will soon kill men.' They at once
acknowledge the necessity of instant action, and turn out to kill him." It
is the promptness with which measures are taken by the greater part of the
natives of Southern Africa to put an end to any lion which may take to
eating men that prevents these animals as a rule from becoming the
formidable pests which man-eating tigers appear to be in parts of India.
But man-eating lions in Africa are not invariably old animals. One which
killed thirty-seven human beings in 1887, on the Majili River, to the
north-west of the Victoria Falls of the Zambesi, was, when at last he was
killed, found to be an animal in the prime of life; whilst the celebrated
man-eaters of the Tsavo River, in East Africa, were also apparently strong,
healthy animals. These two man-eating lions caused such consternation
amongst the Indian workmen on the Uganda Railway that the work of
construction was considerably retarded, the helpless coolies refusing to
remain any longer in a country where they were liable to be eaten on any
night by a man-eating lion. Both these lions were at last shot by one of
the engineers on the railway (Mr. J. H. Patterson), but not before they had
killed and devoured twenty-eight Indian coolies and an unknown number of
native Africans.

THE TIGER.

TIGERS are the "type animal" of Asia. They are found nowhere else. Lions
were inhabitants, even in historic times, of Europe, and are still common
on the Euphrates and in parts of Persia, just as they were when the
Assyrian kings shot them with arrows from their hunting-chariots. They
survived in Greece far later than the days when story says that Hercules
slew the Nemean lion in the Peloponnesus, for the baggage-animals of
Xerxes' army of invasion were attacked by lions near Mount Athos. But the
tiger never comes, and never did come in historic times, nearer to Europe
than the Caucasian side of the Caspian Sea. On the other hand, they range
very far north. All our tiger-lore is Indian. There is scarcely a story of
tigers to be found in English books of sport which deals with the animal
north of the line of the Himalaya. These Chinese northern tigers and the
Siberian tigers are far larger than those of India. They have long woolly
coats, in order to resist the cold. Their skins are brought to London in
hundreds every year to the great fur-sales. But the animals themselves we
never see. The present writer was informed by a friend that in the Amur
Valley he shot three of these tigers in a day, putting them up in thick
bush-scrub by the aid of dogs.

A TIGER BEFORE SLEEPING.

Tigers, when about to sleep, sit in this position; when more drowsy, they
lie down or roll over on their backs.]

The ROYAL BENGAL TIGER, so called, and very properly called in the old
books of natural history, is a different and far more savage beast. It is
almost _invariably_ a ferocious savage, fierce by nature, never wishing to
be otherwise than a destroyer--of beasts mainly, but often of men. Compared
with the lion, it is far longer, but rather lighter, for the lion is more
massive and compact. "A well-grown tigress," says Sir Samuel Baker, "may
weigh on an average 240 lbs. live weight. A very fine tiger may weigh 440
lbs., but if fat the same tiger would weigh 500 lbs. There may be tigers
which weigh 50 lbs. more than this; but I speak according to my experience.
I have found that a tiger of 9 feet 8 inches is about 2 inches above the
average. The same skin may be _stretched_ to measure 10 feet. A tiger in
the Zoological Gardens is a long, lithe creature with little flesh. Such a
specimen affords a poor example of this grand animal in its native jungles,
with muscles in their full, ponderous development from continual exertion
in nightly travels over long distances, and in mortal struggles when
wrestling with its prey. A well-fed tiger is by no means a slim figure. On
the contrary, it is exceedingly bulky, broad in the shoulders, back, and
loins, and with an extraordinary girth of limbs, especially in the forearms
and wrists."

This ponderous, active, and formidably armed creature is, as might be
expected, able to hold its own wherever Europeans do not form part of the
regular population. In India the peasants are quite helpless even against a
cattle-killing tiger in a populous part of the country. In the large
jungles, and on the islands at the mouths of the great rivers, the tigers
have things all their own way. Things are no better in the Far East. A
large peninsula near Singapore is said to have been almost abandoned by its
cultivators lately, owing to the loss of life caused by the tigers. In the
populous parts of India the tiger is far more stealthy than in the
out-of-the-way districts. It only hunts by night; and after eating a part
of the animal killed, moves off to a distance, and does not return.
Otherwise the regular habit is to return to the kill just at or after dusk,
and finish the remainder. Its suspicions seem quite lulled to sleep after
dark. Quite recently a sportsman sat up to watch for a tiger at a
water-hole. It was in the height of the Indian hot season, when very little
water was left. All the creatures of that particular neighbourhood were in
the habit of coming to drink at one good pool still left in the rocky bed
of the river. There the tigers came too. The first night they did not come
until all the other creatures--hog, deer, peacocks, and monkeys--had been
down to drink. They then came so softly over the sand that the gunner in
waiting did not hear them pass. His first knowledge that they were there
was due to the splashing they made as they entered the water. It was quite
dark, and he felt not a little nervous, for the bush on which he was seated
on a small platform was only some 10 feet high. He heard the two tigers
pass him, not by their footsteps, but by the dripping of the water as it
ran off their bodies on to the sand. Next night they came again. This time,
though it was dark, he shot one in a very ingenious manner. The two tigers
walked into the water, and apparently lay down or sat down in it, with
their heads out. They only moved occasionally, lapping the water, but did
not greatly disturb the surface. On this was reflected a bright star from
the sky above. The sportsman put the sight of the rifle on the star, and
kept it up to his shoulder. Something obliterated the star, and he
instantly fired. The "something" was the tiger's head, which the bullet
duly hit.

TIGERS IN ITALY.

These tigers were photographed in Turin. Italy was the first European
country to which these animals were brought from the East.]

The hill-tigers of India are, or were, much more given to hunting by day
than the jungle-tigers. In the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India the late
General Douglas Hamilton said that before night the tigers were already
about hunting, and that in the shade of evening it was dangerous to ride on
a pony--not because the tigers wished to kill the rider, but because they
might mistake the pony and its rider for a sambar deer. He was stalked like
this more than once. Often, when stalking sambar deer and ibex by day, he
saw the tigers doing the same, or after other prey. "My brother Richard,"
he writes, "was out after a tiger which the hillmen reported had killed a
buffalo about an hour before. He saw the tiger on first getting to the
ground, and the tiger had seen him. It was lying out in the open watching
the buffalo, and shuffled into the wood, and would not come out again. Next
morning, when we got to the ground, the tiger was moving from rock to rock,
and had dragged the body into a nullah.... We were upon the point of
starting home when we observed a number of vultures coming down to the
carcase. The vultures began to collect in large numbers on the opposite
hill. I soon counted fifty; but they would not go near the buffalo. Then
some crows, bolder than the rest, flew down, and made a great row over
their meal. All of a sudden they all flew up, and I made certain it was the
tiger. Then my brother fired, and there he was, shot right through the
brain, lying just above the buffalo. He had been brought down by the noise
the crows were making. Upon driving the _sholas_ (small woods on these
hills), tigers were often put out. Sometimes they availed themselves of the
drive to secure food for themselves. A wood was being driven, when a
tremendous grunting was heard, and out rushed an old boar, bristling and
savage. B---- was about to raise his rifle, when a growl like thunder
stopped him, and a great tiger with one spring cleared the nullah, and
alighted on the back of the old boar. Such a battle then took place that,
what with the growls of the tiger and the squeals of the boar, one might
believe oneself in another world. I thought of nothing but of how to kill
one or the other, or both; so, as they were rolling down over and over,
about fifty yards from me on the open hillside, I let fly both barrels. For
a second or two the noise went on; then the tiger jumped off, and the boar
struggled into the nullah close by. The tiger pulled up, and coolly stared
at us without moving; but his courage seemed to fail him, and he sprang
into the nullah and disappeared."

LEOPARDS.

A pair of leopards, one spotted, the other black. Black leopards may be the
offspring of the ordinary spotted form; they are generally much more
savage.]

In most parts of India tigers are now scarce and shy, except in the
preserves of the great rajas, and the dominions of some mighty and pious
Hindu potentates, such as the Maharaja of Jeypur, who, being supposed to be
descended from a Hindu god, allows no wild animals to be killed. There the
deer and pig are so numerous that tigers are welcome to keep them down. But
the Sunderbunds, unwholesome islands at the Ganges mouth, still swarm with
them. So does the Malay Peninsula.

Mr. J. D. Cobbold shot a tiger in Central Asia in a swamp so deep in snow
and so deadly cold that he dared not stay for fear of being frozen to
death. Tigers sometimes wander as far west as the Caucasus near the
Caspian. The farther north, the larger your tiger, is the rule. The biggest
ever seen in Europe was a Siberian tiger owned by Herr Carl Hagenbeck, of
Hamburg, and the largest known skin and skull is from the Far North. The
skin is 13 feet 6 inches from the nose to the end of the tail. The largest
Indian tiger-skin, from one killed by the Maharaja of Cuch Behar, measures
11 feet 7 inches.


LEOPARDS.

Less in size, but even more ferocious, the LEOPARD has a worse character
than the tiger. Living mainly in trees, and very nocturnal, this fierce and
dangerous beast is less often seen than far rarer animals. It is widely
spread over the world, from the Cape of Good Hope to the Atlas Mountains,
and from Southern China to the Black Sea, where it is sometimes met with in
the Caucasus. There seems to be no legend of its presence in Greece, Italy,
or Spain; but it was quite common in Asia Minor; and Cicero, when governor
of Cilicia, was plagued by an aristocratic young friend in Rome to send him
leopards to exhibit in a fête he was giving.

Any one who has frequented the Zoo for any time must have noticed the
difference in size and colour between leopards from different parts of the
world. On some the ground-colour is almost white, in others a clear
nut-brown. Others are jet-black. Wherever they live, they are cattle
thieves, sheep thieves, and dog thieves. Though not formidable in
appearance, they are immensely strong. Sometimes one will turn man-eater.
Both in India and lately in Africa cases have been known where they have
"set up" in this line as deliberately as any tiger. They have four or five
young at a birth, which may often be kept tame for some time and are
amusing pets. But the following plain story shows the danger of such
experiments. At Hong-kong an English merchant had a tame leopard, which was
brought into the room by a coolie for the guests to see at a dinner party.
Excited by the smell of food, it refused to go out when one of the ladies,
who did not like its looks, wished for it to be removed. The man took hold
of its collar and began to haul it out. It seized him by the neck, bit it
through, and in a minute the coolie was dying, covered with blood, on the
dining-room floor!

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

A YOUNG LEOPARD

The leopard cub is far more cat-like in appearance than the young tiger or
lion.]

The Chinese leopard ranges as far north as the Siberian tiger, and, like
the latter, seems to grow larger the farther north it is found. The colour
of these northern leopards is very pale, the spots large, and the fur very
long. At the March fur-sales of the present year, held at the stores of Sir
Charles Lampson, there were Siberian leopard-skins as large as those of a
small tiger.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan]_     [_Highbury._

SNOW-LEOPARD, OR OUNCE.

This is a striking portrait of a very beautiful animal. Note the long bushy
tail, thick coat, and large eyes.]

Leopards are essentially tree-living and nocturnal animals. Sleeping in
trees or caves by day, they are seldom disturbed. They do an incredible
amount of mischief among cattle, calves, sheep, and dogs, being especially
fond of killing and eating the latter. They seize their prey by the throat,
and cling with their claws until they succeed in breaking the spine or in
strangling the victim. The largest leopards are popularly called PANTHERS.
In India they sometimes become man-eaters, and are always very dangerous.
They have a habit of feeding on putrid flesh; this makes wounds inflicted
by their teeth or claws liable to blood-poisoning. Nothing in the way of
prey comes amiss to them, from a cow in the pasture to a fowl up at roost.
"In every country," says Sir Samuel Baker, "the natives are unanimous in
saying that the leopard is more dangerous than the lion or tiger. Wherever
I have been in Africa, the natives have declared that they had no fear of a
lion, provided they were not hunting, for it would not attack unprovoked,
but that a leopard was never to be trusted. I remember when a native boy,
accompanied by his grown-up brother, was busily employed with others in
firing the reeds on the opposite bank of a small stream. Being thirsty and
hot, the boy stooped down to drink, when he was immediately seized by a
leopard. His brother, with admirable aim, hurled his spear at the leopard
while the boy was in his jaws. The point separated the vertebræ of the
neck, and the leopard fell stone-dead. The boy was carried to my hut, but
there was no chance of recovery. The fangs had torn open the chest and
injured the lungs. These were exposed to view through the cavity of the
ribs. He died the same night."

In the great mountain-ranges of Central Asia the beautiful SNOW-LEOPARD is
found. It is a large creature, with thick, woolly coat, and a long tail
like a fur boa. The colour is white, clouded with beautiful grey, like that
of an Angora cat. The edges of the cloudings and spots are marked with
black or darker grey. The eyes are very large, bluish grey or
smoke-coloured. It lives on the wild sheep, ibex, and other mountain
animals. In captivity it is far the tamest and gentlest of the large
carnivora, not excepting the puma. Unlike the latter, it is a sleepy, quiet
animal, like a domestic cat. The specimen shown here belonged to a lady in
India, who kept it for some time as a pet. It was then brought to the
Zoological Gardens, where it was more amiable and friendly than most cats.
The writer has entered its cage with the keeper, stroked it, and patted its
head, without in the least ruffling its good-temper. The heat of the
lion-house did not suit it, and it died of consumption.

THE NEW WORLD CATS.

The cats, great and small, of the New World resemble those of the Old,
though not quite so closely as the caribou, wapiti deer, and moose of the
northern forests resemble the reindeer, red deer, and elk of Europe. They
are like, but with a difference. The Jaguar and the Ocelot are respectively
larger and far more beautiful than their counterparts, the leopard and
serval cats. But the Puma, the one medium-sized feline animal which is
unspotted, is something unique. The jaguar and puma are found very far
south in South America; and though the jaguar is really a forest animal, it
seems to have wandered out on to the Pampas of Argentina, perhaps attracted
by the immense numbers of cattle, sheep, and horses on these plains.

THE JAGUAR.

The JAGUAR is as savage as it is formidable, but does not often attack men.
Its headquarters are the immense forests running from Central America to
Southern Brazil; and as all great forests are little inhabited, the jaguar
is seldom encountered by white men. By the banks of the great rivers it is
semi-aquatic; it swims and climbs with equal ease, and will attack animals
on board boats anchored in the rivers. As there are few animals of great
size in these forests, its great strength is not often seen exercised, as
is that of the lion; but it is the personification of concentrated force,
and its appearance is well worth studying from that point of view. The
spots are larger and squarer than in the leopard, the head ponderous, the
forearms and feet one mass of muscle, knotted under the velvet skin. On the
Amazons it draws its food alike from the highest tree-tops and the
river-bed; in the former it catches monkeys in the branches, fish in the
shallows of the rivers, and scoops out turtles' eggs from the sandbanks.
Humboldt, who visited these regions when the white population was scarce,
declared that 4,000 jaguars were killed annually, and 2,000 skins exported
from Buenos Ayres alone. It was clearly common on the Pampas in his day,
and made as great havoc among the cattle and horses as it does to-day.


THE PUMA.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

FEMALE PUMA.

This shows a puma alert and vigilant, with ears pricked forward.]

The PUMA is a far more interesting creature. It is found from the mountains
in Montana, next the Canadian boundary, to the south of Patagonia. Yankee
stories of its ferocity may have some foundation; but the writer believes
there is no recorded instance of the northern puma attacking man
unprovoked, though in the few places where it now survives it kills
cattle-calves and colts. It is relentlessly hunted with dogs, treed, and
shot. As to the puma of the southern plains and central forests, the
natives, whether Indians or Gauchos, agree with the belief, steadily handed
down from the days of the first Spanish conquest, that the puma is the one
wild cat which is naturally friendly to man. The old Spaniards called it
_amigo del Cristiano_ (the Christian's friend); and Mr. Hudson, in "The
Naturalist in La Plata," gives much evidence of this most curious and
interesting tendency: "It is notorious that where the puma is the only
large beast of prey it is perfectly safe for a small child to go out and
sleep on the plain.... The puma is always at heart a kitten, taking
unmeasured delight in its frolics; and when, as often happens, one lives
alone in the desert, it will amuse itself for hours fighting mock battles
or playing hide-and-seek with imaginary companions, or lying in wait and
putting all its wonderful strategy in practice to capture a passing
butterfly." From Azara downwards these stories have been told too often not
to be largely true; and in old natural histories, whose writers believed
the puma was a terrible man-eater, they also appear as "wonderful escapes."
One tells how a man put his _poncho_, or cloak, over his back when crawling
up to get a shot at some duck, and felt something heavy on the end of it.
He crept from under it, and there was a puma sitting on it, which did not
offer to hurt him.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

OCELOT.

Note the elongated spots, and their arrangement in chains.]

As space forbids further quotation from Mr. Hudson's experiences, which
should be read, the writer will only add one anecdote which was told him by
Mr. Everard im Thurn, C.B., formerly an official in British Guiana. He was
going up one of the big rivers in his steam-launch, and gave a passage to
an elderly and respectable Cornish miner, who wanted to go up to a
gold-mine. The visitor had his meals on the boat, but at night went ashore
with the men and slung his hammock between two trees, leaving the cabin to
his host. One morning two of the Indian crew brought the miner's hammock on
board with a good deal of laughing and talking. Their master asked what the
joke was, whereupon, pointing to the trees whence they had unslung the
hammock, one said, "Tiger sleep with old man last night." They were quite
in earnest, and pointed out a hollow and marks on the leaves, which showed
that a puma had been lying _just under the man's hammock_. When asked if he
had noticed anything in the night, he said, "Only the frogs croaking
wakened me up." The croaking of the frogs was probably the hoarse purring
of the friendly puma enjoying his proximity to a sleeping man. Mr. Hudson
quotes a case in which four pumas played round and leapt over a person
camping out on the Pampas. He watched them for some time, and then went to
sleep! Many of those brought to this country come with their tempers ruined
by ill-treatment and hardship; but a large proportion are as tame as cats.
Captain Marshall had one at Marlow which used to follow him on a chain and
watch the boats full of pleasure-seekers at the lock.

The puma is always a beautiful creature,--the fur cinnamon-coloured, tinged
with gold; the belly and chest white; the tail long, full, and round.
Though friendly to man, it is a desperate cattle-killer, and particularly
fond of horse-flesh, so much so that it has been suggested that the
indigenous wild horses of America were destroyed by the puma.

There are two other cats of the Pampas--the GRASS-CAT, not unlike our wild
cat in appearance and habits, and the WOOD-CAT, or Geoffroy's Cat. It is a
tabby, and a most elegant creature, of which there is a specimen, at the
time of writing, in the London Zoo.


THE OCELOT.

In the forest region is also found the most beautiful of the medium-sized
cats. This is the OCELOT, which corresponds somewhat to the servals, but is
not the least like a lynx, as the servals are. It is entirely a tree-cat,
and lives on birds and monkeys. The following detailed description of its
coloration appeared in "Life at the Zoo":--

"Its coat, with the exception perhaps of that of the clouded leopard of
Sumatra, marks the highest development of ornament among four-footed
animals. The Argus pheasant alone seems to offer a parallel to the beauties
of the ocelot's fur, especially in the development of the wonderful ocelli,
which, though never reaching in the beast the perfect cup-and-ball ornament
seen on the wings of the bird, can be traced in all the early stages of
spots and wavy lines, so far as the irregular shell-shaped rim and dot on
the feet, sides, and back, just as in the subsidiary ornament of the Argus
pheasant's feathers. Most of the ground-tint of the fur is smoky-pearl
colour, on which the spots develop from mere dots on the legs and speckles
on the feet and toes to large egg-shaped ocelli on the flanks. There are
also two beautiful pearl-coloured spots on the back of each ear, like those
which form the common ornaments of the wings of many moths."

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

OCELOT FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.

The ocelot can be tamed and almost domesticated if taken young, and is
occasionally kept as a pet by the forest Indians.]

The nose is pink; the eye large, convex, and translucent.

A tame ocelot described by Wilson, the American naturalist, was most
playful and affectionate, but when fed with flesh was less tractable. It
jumped on to the back of a horse in the stable, and tried to curl up on its
hindquarters. The horse threw the ocelot off and kicked it, curing it of
any disposition to ride. On seeing a horse, the ocelot always ran off to
its kennel afterwards. When sent to England, it caught hold of and threw
down a child of four years old, whom it rolled about with its paws without
hurting it.


OTHER WILD CATS.

A handsome leopard-like animal is the CLOUDED LEOPARD. It is the size of a
small common leopard, but far gentler in disposition. Its fur is not
spotted, but marked with clouded patches, outlined in grey and olive-brown.
Its skin is among the most beautiful of the Cats. It is found in the Malay
Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Formosa, and along the foot of the Himalaya
from Nepal to Assam. Writing of two which he kept, Sir Stamford Raffles
said: "No kitten could be more good-tempered. They were always courting
intercourse with persons passing by, and in the expression of their
countenance showed the greatest delight when noticed, throwing themselves
on their backs, and delighting in being tickled and rubbed. On board ship
there was a small dog, which used to play around the cage with the animal.
It was amusing to watch the tenderness and playfulness with which the
latter came in contact with its smaller-sized companion." Both specimens
were procured from the banks of the Bencoolin River, in Sumatra. They are
generally found near villages, and are not dreaded by the natives, except
in so far that they destroy their poultry.

GOLDEN CAT.

Sumatra is the home of this very beautifully coloured cat. The general tint
is that of gold-stone. Sometimes the belly is pure white.]

The number of smaller leopard-cats and tiger-cats is very great. They fall,
roughly, into three groups: those which are yellow and spotted, those which
are grey and spotted, and those which are grey and striped, or
"whole-coloured." There is no wholly grey wild cat, but several
sandy-coloured species. All live on birds and small mammals, and probably
most share the tame cat's liking for fish. Among the grey-and-spotted cats
are the MOTTLED CAT of the Eastern Himalaya and Straits Settlements and
islands; the TIBETIAN TIGER-CAT; the FISHING-CAT of India and Ceylon, which
is large enough to kill lambs, but lives much on fish and large
marsh-snails; GEOFFROY'S CAT, an American species; the LEOPARD-CAT of Java
and Japan, which seems to have grey fur in Japan and a fulvous leopard-like
skin in India, where it is also called the TIGER-CAT; and the smallest of
all wild cats, the little RUSTY-SPOTTED CAT of India. This has rusty spots
on a grey ground. "I had a kitten brought to me," says Dr. Jerdon of the
species, "when very young. It became quite tame, and was the delight and
admiration of all who saw it. When it was about eight months old, I
introduced the fawn of a gazelle into the room where it was. The little
creature flew at it the moment it saw it, seized it by the nape of the
neck, and was with difficulty taken off." Of the whole-coloured wild
cats--which include the BAY CAT, the American PAMPAS-CAT, PALLAS' CAT of
Tibet and India--the most beautiful is the GOLDEN CAT of Sumatra, one of
which is now in the Zoological Gardens. It has a coat the colour of
gold-stone. The nose is pink, the eyes large and topaz-coloured, the cheeks
striped with white, and the under-parts and lower part of the tail pure
white.

EYRA CAT.

The lowest and longest of the cats, shaped more like a civet; it is readily
tamed, and makes a charming pet.]

Four kinds of wild cats are known in South Africa, of which the largest is
the SERVAL, a short-tailed, spotted animal, with rather more woolly fur
than the leopard's. The length is about 4 feet 2 inches, of which the tail
is only 12 inches. It is found from Algeria to the Cape; but its favourite
haunts, like those of all the wild cats of hot countries, are in the reeds
by rivers. It kills hares, rats, birds, and small mammals generally.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BAY CAT.

This is an example of the completely tawny small cats.]

The BLACK-FOOTED WILD CAT is another African species. It is a beautiful
spotted-and-lined tabby, the size of a small domestic cat, and as likely as
any other to be the origin of our tabby variety, if tame cats came to
Europe from Africa. At present it is only found south in the Kalahari
Desert and Bechuanaland.

The KAFFIR CAT is the common wild cat of the Cape Colony, and a very
interesting animal. It is a whole-coloured tawny, upstanding animal, with
all the indifference to man and generally independent character of the
domestic tom-cat. It is, however, much stronger than the tame cats, with
which it interbreeds freely. In the Colony it is often difficult to keep
male tame cats, for the wild Kaffir cats come down and fight them in the
breeding-season. The Egyptian cat is really the same animal, slightly
modified by climate. A very distinct species is the JUNGLE-CAT, ranging
from India, through Baluchistan, Syria, and East Africa, and called in
Hindustani the CHAUS. The European striped wild cat extends to the
Himalaya, where the range of the lion-coloured, yellow-eyed chaus begins.
The chaus has a few black bars inside the legs, which vary in different
regions. The Indian chaus has only one distinctly marked; the Kaffir cat
has four or five. The EGYPTIAN FETTERED CAT has been said to be the origin
of the domestic and sacred cats of Egypt. A male chaus is most formidable
when "cornered." General Hamilton chased one, which had prowled into the
cantonments on the look-out for fowls, into a fence. "After a long time I
spied the cat squatting in a hedge," he writes, "and called for the dogs.
When they came, I knelt down and began clapping my hands and cheering them
on. The cat suddenly made a clean spring at my face. I had just time to
catch it as one would a cricket-ball, and, giving its ribs a strong
squeeze, threw it to the dogs; but not before it had made its teeth meet in
my arm just above the wrist. For some weeks I had to carry my arm in a
sling, and I shall carry the marks of the bite to my grave."

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

AFRICAN CHAUS, OR JUNGLE-CAT.

The chaus is the Indian and African equivalent of our wild cat. It is
equally strong and savage.]

The chaus, as will be seen from the above, wanders boldly down into the
outskirts of large towns, cantonments, and bungalows, on the look-out for
chickens and pigeons. Its favourite plan is to lie up at dawn in some piece
of thick cover near to where the poultry wander out to scratch, feed, and
bask. It then pounces on the nearest unhappy hen and rushes off with it
into cover. An acquaintance of the writer once had a number of fine Indian
game fowl, of which he was not a little proud. He noticed that one was
missing every morning for three days, and, not being able to discover the
robber, shut them up in a hen-house. Next morning he heard a great
commotion outside, and one of his bearers came running in to say that a
leopard was in the hen-house. As this was only built of bamboo or some such
light material, it did not seem probable that a leopard would stay there.
Getting his rifle, he went out into the compound, and cautiously approached
the hen-house, in which the fowls were still making loud protests and cries
of alarm. The door was shut; but some creature--certainly not a
leopard--might have squeezed in through the small entrance used by the
hens. He opened the door, and saw at the back of the hen-house a chaus
sitting, with all its fur on end, looking almost as large as a small
leopard. On the floor was one dead fowl. The impudent jungle-cat rushed for
the door, but had the coolness to seize the hen as it passed, and with this
in its mouth rushed past the owner of the hens, his servants and retainers,
and reached a piece of thick scrub near with its prize.

As the chaus is common both in India and Africa, a comparison of its habits
in both continents is somewhat interesting. Jerdon, the Indian naturalist,
writes: "It is the common wild cat from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin, and
from the level of the sea to 7,000 or 8,000 feet elevation. It frequents
alike the jungles and the open country, and is very partial to long reeds,
and grass, sugarcane-fields, and corn-fields. It does much damage to all
game, especially to hares and partridges. Quite recently I shot a pea-fowl
at the edge of a sugarcane-field. One of these cats sprang out, seized the
pea-fowl, and after a short struggle--for the bird was not quite
dead--carried it off before my astonished eyes, and, in spite of my running
up, made his escape with his booty. It must have been stalking these very
birds, so closely did its spring follow my shot. It is said to breed twice
a year, and to have three or four young at a birth. I have very often had
the young brought to me, but always failed in rearing them; and they always
showed a savage and untamable disposition. I have seen numbers of cats
about villages in various parts of the country that must have been hybrids
between this cat and the tame ones."

The late Sir Oliver St. John was more fortunate with his jungle-cat
kittens. He obtained three in Persia. These he reared till they were three
months old, by which time they became so tame that they would climb on to
his knees at breakfast-time, and behave like ordinary kittens. One was
killed by a greyhound, and another by a scorpion--a curious fate for a
kitten to meet. The survivor then became morose and ill-tempered, but grew
to be a large and strong animal. "Two English bull-terriers of mine, which
would make short work of the largest domestic cat, could do nothing against
my wild cat," says the same writer. "In their almost daily battles the dogs
always got the worst of it."

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

SERVAL.

This is a spotted cat, with long ears, but no tufts on them, as in the true
lynxes.]

In Africa the chaus haunts the thick cover bordering the rivers. There it
catches not only water-fowl, but also fish. According to Messrs. Nicolls
and Eglington, "its spoor may constantly be seen imprinted on the mud
surrounding such pools in the periodical watercourses as are constantly
being dried up, and in which fish may probably be imprisoned without chance
of escape." The chaus has for neighbour in Africa the beautiful SERVAL, a
larger wild cat. This species is reddish in colour, spotted on the body,
and striped on the legs. The ears are long, but not tufted, like those of
the lynx. The serval is more common in North and Central Africa than in the
South. But it is also found south of the Tropic of Capricorn. Messrs.
Nicolls and Eglington say of it: "Northward through South Central Africa it
is fairly common. It frequents the thick bush in the vicinity of rivers.
The _karosses_, or mantles, made from its skins are only worn by the chiefs
and very high dignitaries amongst the native tribes, and are in consequence
eagerly sought after, on which account the species runs a risk of rapid
extermination. Its usual prey consists of the young of the smaller
antelopes, francolins, and wild guinea-fowls, to the latter of which it is
a most destructive enemy in the breeding-season. When obtained young, the
serval can be tamed with little trouble; but it is difficult to rear, and
always shows a singular and almost unaccountable aversion to black men. Its
otherwise even temper is always aroused at the sight of a native. When in
anger, it is by no means a despicable antagonist, and very few dogs would
like to engage in a combat with one single-handed."

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

MALE SERVAL.

The serval is a link between the leopards and tiger-cats, quite large
enough to kill the young of the smaller antelopes.]


THE COMMON WILD CAT.

The WILD CAT was once fairly common all over England. A curious story,
obviously exaggerated, shows that traditions of its ferocity were common at
a very early date. The tale is told of the church of Barnborough, in
Yorkshire, between Doncaster and Barnsley. It is said that a man and a wild
cat met in a wood near and began to fight; that the cat drove the man out
of the wood as far as the church, where he took refuge in the porch; and
that both the man and cat were so injured that they died. According to Dr.
Pearce, the event was formerly commemorated by a rude painting in the
church.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

SERVAL CLIMBING.

Note the active, cat-like method of climbing.]

Mr. Charles St. John had an experience with a Scotch wild cat very like
that which General Douglas Hamilton tells of the jungle-cat. He heard many
stories of their attacking and wounding men when trapped or when their
escape was cut off, and before long found out that these were true. "I was
fishing in a river in Sutherland," he wrote, "and in passing from one pool
to another had to climb over some rocky ground. In doing so, I sank almost
up to my knees in some rotten heather and moss, almost upon a wild cat
which was concealed under it. I was quite as much startled as the cat
itself could be, when I saw the wild-looking beast rush so unexpectedly
from between my feet, with every hair on her body on end, making her look
twice as large as she really was. I had three small Skye terriers with me,
which immediately gave chase, and pursued her till she took refuge in a
corner of the rocks, where, perched in a kind of recess out of reach of her
enemies, she stood with her hair bristled out, spitting and growling like a
common cat. Having no weapon with me, I laid down my rod, cut a good-sized
stick, and proceeded to dislodge her. As soon as I was within six or seven
feet of the place, she sprang straight at my face over the dogs' heads. Had
I not struck her in mid-air as she leaped at me, I should probably have
received a severe wound. As it was, she fell with her back half broken
among the dogs, who with my assistance dispatched her. I never saw an
animal fight so desperately, or one which was so difficult to kill. If a
tame cat has nine lives, a wild cat must have a dozen. Sometimes one of
these animals will take up its residence at no great distance from a house,
and, entering the hen-roosts and outbuildings, will carry off fowls in the
most audacious manner, or even lambs. Like other vermin, the wild cat
haunts the shores of lakes and rivers, and it is therefore easy to know
where to set a trap for them. Having caught and killed one of the colony,
the rest of them are sure to be taken if the body of their slain relative
is left in the same place not far from their usual hunting-ground and
surrounded with traps, as every wild cat passing that way will to a
certainty come to it."

The wild cat ranges from the far north of Scotland, across Europe and
Northern Asia, to the northern slopes of the Himalaya. It has always been
known as one of the fiercest and wildest of the cats, large or small. The
continual ill-temper of these creatures is remarkable. In the experience of
the keepers of menageries there is no other so intractably savage. One
presented to the Zoological Gardens by Lord Lilford some eight years ago
still snarls and spits at any one who comes near it, even the keeper.

[Illustration: _By permission of Percy Leigh Pemberton, Esq._

EUROPEAN WILD CAT.

The British representative of this species is rapidly becoming extinct. The
specimen whose portrait is given here was caught in Argyllshire.]

The food of the wild cat is grouse, mountain-hares, rabbits, small birds,
and probably fish caught in the shallow waters when chance offers. It is
wholly nocturnal; consequently no one ever sees it hunting for prey. Though
it has long been confined to the north and north-west of Scotland, it is by
no means on the verge of extinction. The deer-forests are saving it to some
extent, as they did the golden eagle. Grouse and hares are rather in the
way when deer are being stalked; consequently the wild cat and the eagle
are not trapped or shot. The limits of its present fastnesses were recently
fixed by careful Scotch naturalists at the line of the Caledonian Canal.
Mr. Harvie Brown, in 1880, said that it only survived in Scotland north of
a line running from Oban to the junction of the three counties of Perth,
Forfar, and Aberdeen, and thence through Banffshire to Inverness. But the
conclusion of a writer in the _Edinburgh Review_ of July, 1898, in a very
interesting article on the survival of British mammals, has been happily
contradicted. He believed that it only survived in the deer-forests of
Inverness and Sutherlandshire. The wild cats shown in the illustrations of
these pages were caught a year later as far south as Argyllshire. The
father and two kittens were all secured, practically unhurt, and purchased
by Mr. Percy Leigh Pemberton for his collection of British mammals at
Ashford, in Kent. This gentleman has had great success in preserving his
wild cats. They, as well as others--martens, polecats, and other small
carnivora--are fed on fresh wild rabbits killed in a warren near;
consequently they are in splendid condition. The old "tom" wild cat,
snarling with characteristic ill-humour, was well supported by the wild and
savage little kittens, which exhibited all the family temper. Shortly
before the capture of these wild cats another family were trapped in
Aberdeenshire and brought to the Zoological Gardens. Four kittens,
beautiful little savages, with bright green eyes, and uninjured, were
safely taken to Regent's Park. But the quarters given them were very small
and cold, and they all died. Two other full-grown wild cats brought there a
few years earlier were so dreadfully injured by the abominable steel traps
in which they were caught that they both died of blood-poisoning.

[Illustration: _By permission of Percy Leigh Pemberton, Esq._

SCOTCH WILD CATS.

These wild cats, the property of Mr. P. Leigh Pemberton, though regularly
fed and well treated, show their natural bad-temper in their faces.]

The real wild cats differ in their markings on the body, some being more
clearly striped, while others are only brindled. But they are all alike in
the squareness and thickness of head and body, and in the short tail,
ringed with black, and growing larger at the tip, which ends off like a
shaving-brush.

It may well be asked, Which of the many species of wild cats mentioned
above is the ancestor of our domestic cats? Probably different species in
different countries. The African Kaffir cat, the Indian leopard-cat, the
rusty-spotted cat of India, and the European wild cat all breed with tame
cats. It is therefore probable that the spotted, striped, and brindled
varieties of tame cats are descended from wild species which had those
markings. The so-called red tame cats are doubtless descended from the
tiger-coloured wild cats. But it is a curious fact that, though the spotted
grey-tabby wild varieties are the least common, that colour is most
frequent in the tame species.


THE LYNXES.

In the LYNXES we seem to have a less specially cat-like form. They are
short-tailed, high in the leg, and broad-faced. Less active than the
leopards and tiger-cats, and able to live either in very hot or very cold
countries, they are found from the Persian deserts to the far north of
Siberia and Canada.

The CARACAL is a southern, hot-country lynx. It has a longer tail than the
others, but the same tufted ears. It seems a link between the lynxes and
the jungle-cats. It is found in India, Palestine, Persia, and Mesopotamia.
In India it was trained, like the cheeta, to catch birds, gazelles, and
hares. The COMMON LYNX is probably the same animal, whether found in
Norway, Russia, the Carpathians, Turkestan, China, or Tibet. The CANADIAN
LYNX is also very probably the same, with local differences of colour. The
NORTHERN LYNX is the largest feline animal left in Europe, and kills sheep
and goats equally with hares and squirrels. The beautiful fur, of pale
cinnamon and light grey, is much admired. In some southern districts of
America we have the RED LYNX, or so-called "wild cat," which is distinct
from the lynx of Canada. The MEDITERRANEAN or SPANISH LYNX seems likewise
entitled to rank as a distinct species.

Of the lynxes the CARACALS are perhaps the most interesting, from their
capacity for domestication. They are found in Africa in the open desert
country, whereas the SERVAL is found in the thick bush. In Africa it is
believed to be the most savage and untamable of the Cats. That is probably
because the Negro and the Kaffir never possessed the art of training
animals, from the elephant downwards. In India the caracal's natural prey
are the fawns of deer and antelope, pea-fowl, hares, and floricans. The
caracal is the quickest with its feet of any of the Cats. One of its
best-known feats is to spring up and catch birds passing over on the wing
at a height of six or eight feet from the ground. A writer, in the
Naturalist's Library, notes that, besides being tamed to catch deer,
pea-fowl, and cranes, the caracal was used in "pigeon matches." Two
caracals were backed one against the other to kill pigeons. The birds were
fed on the ground, and the caracals suddenly let loose among them, to
strike down as many as each could before the birds escaped. Each would
sometimes strike down with its fore paws ten or a dozen pigeons. "Caracal"
means in Turkish "Black Ear," in allusion to the colour of the animal's
organ of hearing.

LYNX.

This animal is a uniformly coloured specie common to India and Africa.]

The COMMON LYNX is a thick-set animal, high in the leg, with a square head
and very strong paws and forearms. It is found across the whole northern
region of Europe and Asia. Although never known in Britain in historic
times, it is still occasionally seen in parts of the Alps and in the
Carpathians; it is also common in the Caucasus. It is mainly a forest
animal, and very largely nocturnal; therefore it is seldom seen, and not
often hunted. If any enemy approaches, the lynx lies perfectly still on
some branch or rock, and generally succeeds in avoiding notice. The lynx is
extremely active; it can leap great distances, and makes its attack usually
in that way. When travelling, it trots or gallops in a very dog-like
fashion. Where sheep graze at large on mountains, as in the Balkans and in
Greece, the lynx is a great enemy of the flocks. In Norway, where the
animal is now very rare, there is a tradition that it is more mischievous
than the wolf, and a high price is set on its head.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

EUROPEAN LYNX.

The largest of the cat tribe left in Europe.]

In Siberia and North Russia most of the lynx-skins taken are sold to the
Chinese. The lynx-skins brought to London are mainly those of the Canadian
species. The fur is dyed, and used for the busbies of the officers in our
hussar regiments. These skins vary much in colour, and in length and
quality of fur. The price varies correspondingly. The Canadian lynx lives
mainly on the wood-hares and on the wood-grouse of the North American
forests. The flesh of the lynx is said to be good and tender.

Brehm says of the Siberian lynx: "It is a forest animal in the strictest
sense of the word. But in Siberia it occurs only singly, and is rarely
captured. Its true home is in the thickest parts in the interior of the
woods, and these it probably never leaves except when scarcity of food or
the calls of love tempt it to wander to the outskirts. Both immigrants and
natives hold the hunting of the lynx in high esteem. This proud cat's
activity, caution and agility, and powers of defence arouse the enthusiasm
of every sportsman, and both skin and flesh are valued, the latter not only
by the Mongolian tribes, but also by the Russian hunters. The lynx is
seldom captured in fall-traps; he often renders them useless by walking
along the beam and stepping on the lever, and he usually leaps over the
spring-traps in his path. So only the rifle and dogs are left."

CANADIAN LYNX.

Great numbers of these are trapped every year for the sake of their fur.]

The RED LYNX is a small American variety, the coat of which turns tawny in
summer, when it much resembles a large cat. It is called in some parts of
the United States the Mountain-cat. This lynx is 30 inches long in the
body, with a tail 6 inches long. It is found on the eastern or Atlantic
side of the continent, and by no means shuns the neighbourhood of
settlements.

CHEETAS.

Cheetas can be distinguished at a glance from ordinary leopards by the
solid black spots on the back instead of the "rosettes."]


THE CHEETA.

THE NON-RETRACTILE-CLAWED CAT.

The CHEETA, or Hunting-leopard, is the only example of this particular
group, though there was an extinct form, whose remains are found in the
Siwalik Hills, in the north of India. It is a very widely dispersed animal,
found in Persia, Turkestan, and the countries east of the Caspian, and in
India so far as the lower part of the centre of the peninsula. It is also
common in Africa, where until recent years it was found in Cape Colony and
Natal. Now it is banished to the Kalahari Desert, the Northern Transvaal,
and Bechuanaland.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

A CHEETA HOODED.

The cheeta is not unhooded until fairly near his quarry, when he is given a
sight of the game, and a splendid race ensues.]

The cheeta is more dog-like than any other cat. It stands high on the leg,
and has a short, rounded head. Its fur is short and rather woolly, its feet
rounded, and its claws, instead of slipping back into sheaths like a
lion's, are only partly retractile.

Mr. Lockwood Kipling gives the following account of the cheeta and its
keepers: "The only point where real skill comes into play in dealing with
the hunting-leopard is in catching the adult animal when it has already
learnt the swift, bounding onset, its one accomplishment. The young cheeta
is not worth catching, for it has not yet learnt its trade, nor can it be
taught in captivity.... There are certain trees where these great dog-cats
(for they have some oddly canine characteristics) come to play and whet
their claws. The hunters find such a tree, and arrange nooses of deer-sinew
round it, and wait the event. The animal comes and is caught by the leg,
and it is at this point that the trouble begins. It is no small achievement
for two or three naked, ill-fed men to secure so fierce a capture and carry
it home tied on a cart. Then his training begins. He is tied in all
directions, principally from a thick rope round his loins, while a hood
fitted over his head effectually blinds him. He is fastened on a strong
cot-bedstead, and the keepers and their wives and families reduce him to
submission by starving him and keeping him awake. His head is made to face
the village street, and for an hour at a time, several times a day, his
keepers make pretended rushes at him, and wave clothes, staves, and other
articles in his face. He is talked to continually, and the women's tongues
are believed to be the most effective of things to keep him awake. No
created being could withstand the effects of hunger, want of sleep, and
feminine scolding; and the poor cheeta becomes piteously, abjectly tame. He
is taken out for a walk occasionally--if a slow crawl between four
attendants, all holding hard, can be called a walk--and his promenades are
always through the crowded streets and bazaars, where the keepers' friends
are to be found; but the people are rather pleased than otherwise to see
the raja's cheetas amongst them." Later, when the creature is tamed, "the
cheeta's bedstead is like that of the keeper, and leopard and man are often
curled up under the same blanket! When his bedfellow is restless, the
keeper lazily stretches out an arm from his end of the cot and dangles a
tassel over the animal's head, which seems to soothe him. In the early
morning I have seen a cheeta sitting up on his couch, a red blanket half
covering him, and his tasselled red hood awry, looking exactly like an
elderly gentleman in a nightcap, as he yawns with the irresolute air of one
who is in doubt whether to rise or to turn in for another nap."

This charming and accurate description shows the cheeta at home. In the
field he is quite another creature. He is driven as near as possible to the
game, and then unhooded and given a sight of them. Sir Samuel Baker thus
describes a hunt in which a cheeta was used: "The chase began after the
right-hand buck, which had a start of about 110 yards. It was a magnificent
sight to see the extraordinary speed of pursuer and pursued. The buck flew
over the level surface, followed by the cheeta, which was laying out at
full stretch, with its long, thick tail brandishing in the air. They had
run 200 yards, when the keeper gave the word, and away we went as fast as
our horses could carry us. The horses could go over this clear ground,
where no danger of a fall seemed possible. I never saw anything to equal
the speed of the buck and the cheeta; we were literally nowhere, although
we were going as hard as horseflesh could carry us; but we had a glorious
view. The cheeta was gaining in the course, while the buck was exerting
every muscle for life or death in its last race. Presently, after a course
of about a quarter of a mile, the buck doubled like a hare, and the cheeta
lost ground as it shot ahead, instead of turning quickly, being only about
thirty yards in rear of the buck. Recovering itself, it turned on extra
steam, and the race appeared to recommence at increased speed. The cheeta
was determined to win, and at this moment the buck made another double in
the hope of shaking off its terrible pursuer; but this time the cheeta ran
cunning, and was aware of the former game. It turned as sharply as the
buck. Gathering itself together for a final effort, it shot forward like an
arrow, picked up the distance which remained between them, and in a cloud
of dust we could for one moment distinguish two forms. The next instant the
buck was on its back, and the cheeta's fangs were fixed like an iron vice
in its throat. The course run was about 600 yards, and it was worth a
special voyage to India to see that hunt."

A CHEETA ON THE LOOK-OUT.

Cheetas are common to Africa and India. By the native princes of the latter
country they are much used for taking antelope and other game.]


THE DOMESTIC CAT.

BY LOUIS WAIN.

Of the domestication of the cat we know very little, but it is recorded
that a tribe of cats was trained to retrieve--_i.e._ to fetch and carry
game. In our own time I have seen many cats fetch and carry corks and
newspapers, and on one occasion pounce upon a small roach at the end of a
line and place it at its owner's feet. Gamekeepers whom I have known agree
that, for cunning, craftiness, and tenacity in attaining an object, the
semi-wild cat of the woods shows far superior intelligence to the rest of
the woodland denizens. It is quite a usual thing to hear of farm cats
entering upon a snake-hunting expedition with the greatest glee, and
showing remarkable readiness in pitching upon their quarry and pinning it
down until secured. These farm cats are quite a race by themselves. Of
decided sporting proclivities, they roam the countryside with considerable
fierceness, and yet revert to the domesticity of the farmhouse fireside as
though innocent of roving instincts. They are spasmodic to a degree in
their mode of life, and apparently work out one mood before entering upon
another. It will be remembered that this spasmodic tendency--the true
feline independence, by-the-bye--is and has been characteristic of the cat
throughout its history, and any one who has tried to overcome it has met
with failure.

WHITE SHORT-HAIRED.

Most white cats are not albinoes--that is to say, they have ordinarily
coloured and not red eyes.]

[Illustration: _Photo by T. Fall_]     [_Baker Street._

LONG-HAIRED WHITE.

White cats with blue eyes are generally deaf, or at all events hard of
hearing.]

Watch your own cat, and you will see that he will change his
sleeping-quarters periodically; and if he can find a newspaper conveniently
placed, he will prefer it to lie upon, before anything perhaps, except a
cane-bottomed chair, to which all cats are very partial. If you keep a
number of cats, as I do, you will find that they are very imitative, and
what one gets in the habit of doing they will all do in time: for instance,
one of my cats took to sitting with his front paws inside my tall hat and
his body outside, and this has become a catty fashion in the family,
whether the object be a hat, cap, bonnet, small basket, box, or tin. If by
chance one of the cats is attacked by a dog, a peculiar cry from the
aggrieved animal will immediately awaken the others out of their lethargy
or sleep, and bring them fiercely to the rescue. They are, too,
particularly kind and nice to the old cat, and are tolerant only of strange
baby kittens and very old cats in the garden as long as they do not
interfere with the "catty" subject. The same quality obtains in Spain or
Portugal, where a race of scavenging cats exists, which go about in droves
or families, and are equal to climbing straight walls, big trees, chimneys,
and mountain-sides. Long, lanky, and thin, they are built more on the lines
of a greyhound than the ordinary cat, and are more easily trained in tricks
than home cats.

SMOKE LONG-HAIRED, OR PERSIAN.

A new breed.]

The TORTOISESHELL has long been looked upon as the national cat of Spain,
and in fact that country is overrun with the breed, ranging from a dense
black and brown to lighter shades of orange-brown and white. The pure
tortoiseshell might be called a black and tan, with no white, streaked like
a tortoiseshell comb if possible, and with wonderful amber eyes. It is
characteristic of their intelligence that they will invariably find their
way home, and will even bring that mysterious instinct to bear which guides
them back long distances to the place of their birth; and, with regard to
this cat, the stories of almost impossible journeys made are not one bit
exaggerated. The tom-cats of this breed are very rare in England; I myself
have only known of the existence of six in fifteen years, and of these but
three are recorded in the catalogues of our cat shows.

[Illustration: SHORT-HAIRED BLUE.

This champion cat belongs to Lady Alexander, by whose kind permission it is
here reproduced.]

The BLACK CAT has many of the characteristics of the tortoiseshell, but is
essentially a town cat, and is wont to dream his life away in shady
corners, in underground cellars, in theatres, and in all places where he
can, in fact, retire to monastic quiet. The black cat of St. Clement Danes
Church was one of the remarkable cats of London. It was his wont to climb
on to the top of the organ-pipes and enjoy an occasional musical concert
alone. A christening or a wedding was his pride; and many people can vouch
for a lucky wedding who had the good-fortune to be patronised by the black
cat of St. Clement Danes, which walked solemnly down the aisle of the
church in front of the happy couples.

My old pet Peter was a black-and-white cat, and, like most of his kind, was
one of the most remarkable cats for intelligence I have ever known. A
recital of his accomplishments would, however, have very few believers--a
fact I find existing in regard to all really intelligent cats. There are so
many cats of an opposite character, and people will rarely take more than a
momentary trouble to win the finer nature of an animal into existence.
Suffice it to say, that Peter would lie and die, sit up with spectacles on
his nose and with a post-card between his paws--a trick I have taught many
people's cats to do. He would also mew silent meows when bid, and wait at
the door for my home-coming. For a long time, too, it was customary to hear
weird footfalls at night outside the bedroom doors, and visitors to the
house were a little more superstitious as to their cause than we were
ourselves. We set a watch upon the supposed ghost, but sudden opening of
the doors discovered only the mystic form of Peter sitting purring on the
stairs. He was, however, ultimately caught in the act of lifting the corner
of the door-rug and letting it fall back in its place, and he had grown
quite expert in his method of raising and dropping it at regular intervals
until he heard that his signals had produced the required effect, and the
door was opened to admit him.

[Illustration: _Photo by T. Fall_]     [_Baker Street._

SILVER TABBY.

A beautiful variety of the typical British cat.]

WHITE CATS I might call musical cats, for it is quite characteristic of the
albinoes that noises rarely startle them out of their simpering, loving
moods. The scraping of a violin, which will scare an ordinary cat out of
its senses, or the thumping of a piano, which would terrorise even
strong-nerved cats, would only incite a white cat to a happier mood.
Certainly all white cats are somewhat deaf, or lack acute quality of
senses; but this failing rather softens the feline nature than becomes
dominant as a weakness.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

SHORT-HAIRED TABBY.

This is perhaps the most famous cat now living. It has won no less than 200
prizes. Lady Decies is its owner.]

The nearest to perfection perhaps, and yet at the same time extremely soft
and finely made, is the BLUE CAT, rare in England as an English cat, but
common in most other countries, and called in America the Maltese Cat--for
fashion's sake probably, since it is too widely distributed there to be
localised as of foreign origin. It is out in the mining districts and
agricultural quarters, right away from the beaten tracks of humanity, where
the most wonderful breeds of cats develop in America; and caravan showmen
have told me that at one time it was quite a business for them to carry
cats into these wildernesses, and sell them to rough, hardy miners, who
dealt out death to each other without hesitation in a quarrel, but who
softened to the appeal of an animal which reminded them of homelier times.

One man told me that upon one occasion he sold eight cats at an isolated
mining township in Colorado, and some six days' journey farther on he was
caught up by a man on horseback from the township, who had ridden hard to
overtake the menagerie caravan, with the news that one of the cats had
climbed a monster pine-tree, and that all the other cats had followed in
his wake; food and drink had been placed in plenty at the foot of the tree,
but that the cats had been starving, frightened out of their senses, for
three days, and despite all attempts to reach them they had only climbed
higher and higher out of reach into the uppermost and most dangerous
branches of the pine. The showman hastened with his guide across country to
the township, only to find that in the interval one bright specimen of a
man belonging to the village had suggested felling the tree, and so
rescuing the cats from the pangs of absolute starvation, should they
survive the ordeal. A dynamite cartridge had been used to blast the roots
of the pine, and a rope attached to its trunk had done the rest and brought
the monster tree to earth, only, however, at the expense of all the cats,
for not one survived the tremendous fall and shaking. A sad and tearful
procession followed the remains of the cats to their hastily dug grave, and
thereafter a bull mastiff took the place of the cats in the township, an
animal more in character with the lives of its inhabitants.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

LONG-HAIRED ORANGE.

A good specimen of this variety is always large and finely furred.]

Analogous to this case of the travelling menageries, we have the great
variety of blues, silvers, and whites which are characteristic of Russia.
There is a vast tableland of many thousands of miles in extent, intersected
by caravan routes to all the old countries of the ancients, and it is not
astonishing to hear of attempts being made to steal the wonderful cats of
Persia, China, and Northern India, as well as those of the many dependent
and independent tribes which bound the Russian kingdom. But it is a
remarkable fact that none but the blues can live in the attenuated
atmosphere of the higher mountainous districts through which they are taken
before arriving in Russian territory. It is no uncommon thing to find a
wonderful complexity of blue cats shading to silver and white in most
Russian villages, or blue cats of remarkable beauty, but with a dash of
tabby-marking running through their coats. Their life, too, is lived at the
two extremes. In the short Russian summer they roam the woodlands, pestered
by a hundred poisonous insects; in the winter they are imprisoned within
the four walls of a snow-covered cottage, and are bound down prisoners to
domesticity till the thaw sets in again. Many of the beautiful furs which
come to us from Russia are really the skins of these cats, the preparation
of which for market has grown into a large and thriving industry. The
country about Kronstadt, in the Southern Carpathian Mountains of Austria,
is famous for its finely developed animals; and here, too, has grown up a
colony of sable-coloured cats, said to be of Turkish origin, where the
pariahs take the place of cats.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

MANX.

These tailless cats are well known; they were formerly called "Cornwall
cats." Note the length of the hind legs, which is one of the
characteristics of this variety of the domestic cat.]

These strikingly coloured cats are now fairly numerous in England, but
command high prices. They have white kittens, which subsequently become
coloured.]

The TABBY is remarkable to us in that it is characteristic of our own
country, and no other colour seems to have been popular until our own
times. If you ask any one which breed of cat is the real domestic cat, you
will be told the tabby, probably because it is so well known to all. The
complexity of the tabby is really remarkable, and for shape and variety of
colouring it has no equal in any other tribe of cat. It has comprised in
its nature all the really great qualities of the feline, and all its worst
attributes. You can truthfully say of one of its specimens that it attaches
itself to the individual, while of another in the same litter you will get
an element of wildness. A third of the same parents will sober down to the
house, but take only a passing notice of people. You can teach it anything
if it is tractable, make it follow like a dog, come to whistle, but it will
have its independence.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

LONG-HAIRED CHINCHILLA.

Note the beautiful "fluffiness" of this cat's fur.]

The SAND-COLOURED CAT, with a whole-coloured coat like the rabbit, which we
know as the ABYSSINIAN or BUNNY CAT, is a strong African type. On the Gold
Coast it comes down from the inland country with its ears all bitten and
torn away in its fights with rivals. It has been acclimatised in England,
and Devonshire and Cornwall have both established a new and distinct tribe
out of its parentage. The MANX CAT is nearly allied to it, and a hundred
years ago the tailless cat was called the Cornwall Cat, not the Manx.

Siam sends us a regal animal in the SIAMESE ROYAL CAT; it has a brown face,
legs, and tail, a cream-coloured body, and mauve or blue eyes. The Siamese
take great care of their cats, for it is believed that the souls of the
departed are transmitted into the bodies of animals, and the cat is a
favourite of their creed; consequently the cats are highly cultivated and
intelligent, and can think out ways and means to attain an end.

I have tried for years to trace the origin of the LONG-HAIRED or PERSIAN
CATS, but I cannot find that they were known to antiquity, and even the
records of later times only mention the SHORT-HAIRED. European literature
does not give us an insight into the subject; and unless Chinese history
holds some hidden lights in its records, we are thrown back upon the myths
of Persia to account for the wonderful modern distribution of the
long-haired cat, which is gradually breeding out into as many varieties as
the short-haired, with this difference--that greater care and trouble are
taken over the long-haired, and they will, as a breed, probably soon
surpass the short-haired for intelligence and culture.

THE "BUN" OR "TICKED" SHORT-HAIRED CAT.

This is one of the rarest cats in England. It belongs to Miss K. Maud
Bennett who has kindly had it photographed for this work.]

One variety is quite new and distinctive--the SMOKE LONG-HAIRED, whose dark
brown or black surface-coat, blown aside, shows an under-coat of blue and
silver, with a light brown frill round its neck. All the other long-haired
cats can pair with the short-haired for colouring and marking, but I have
not yet seen a BUNNY LONG-HAIRED.

CHAPTER III.

_THE FOSSA, CIVETS, AND ICHNEUMONS._

----

THE FOSSA.

In the FOSSA Madagascar possesses an altogether peculiar animal. It is a
very slender, active creature, with all its proportions much elongated. It
is of a bright bay uniform colour, with thick fur, and has sharp retractile
claws. It has been described as the natural connecting-link between the
Civets and the Cats, anatomically speaking. Thus it has retractile claws,
but does not walk on its toes, like cats, but on the soles of its feet (the
hind pair of which is quite naked), like a civet. Very few have been
brought to England; indeed, the first time that one was exhibited in our
Zoological Gardens was only ten years ago. Formerly stories were told of
its ferocity, which was compared to that of the tiger. These tales were
naturally the subject of ridicule. The fossa usually attains a length of
about 5 feet from snout to tail, and is the largest of the carnivora of
Madagascar. A fine young specimen lately brought to London, and in the
Zoological Gardens at the time of writing, is now probably full grown. It
is about the same length and height as a large ocelot, but with a far
longer tail, and is more slenderly built. The extreme activity of the fossa
no doubt renders it a very formidable foe to other and weaker creatures. It
has been described by a recent writer as being entirely nocturnal, and
preying mainly on the lemurs and birds which haunt the forests of
Madagascar. The animal kept at the Zoological Gardens has become fairly
tame. It is fed mainly on chickens' heads and other refuse from poulterers'
shops. Apparently it has no voice of any kind. It neither growls, roars,
nor mews, though, when irritated or frightened, it gives a kind of hiss
like a cat.

LARGE INDIAN CIVET.

Civets are nocturnal in their habits. That shown here has just awakened in
broad daylight.]


THE CIVETS AND GENETS.

The CIVETS are the first marked deviation from the Cat Family. Their bodies
are elongated, their legs short, their claws only partially retractile.
Some of them have glands holding a strong scent, much esteemed in old days
in Europe, when "The Civet Cat" was a common inn-sign even in England. The
civets are generally beautifully marked with black stripes and bands on
grey. But none of them grow to any large size, and the family has never had
the importance of those which contain the large carnivora, like the true
cats or bears. Many of the tribe and its connections are domesticated. Some
scholars have maintained that the cat of the ancient Greeks was one of
them--the common genet. The fact is that both this and the domestic cat
were kept by the ancients; and the genet is still used as a cat by the
peasants of Greece and Southern Italy.

The AFRICAN CIVET and INDIAN CIVET are large species. The former is common
almost throughout Africa. Neither of them seems to climb trees, but they
find abundance of food by catching small ground-dwelling animals and birds.
They are good swimmers. The Indian civet has a handsome skin, of a
beautiful grey ground-colour, with black collar and markings. It is from
these civets that the civet-scent is obtained. They are kept in cages for
this purpose, and the secretion is scooped from the glands with a wooden
spoon. They produce three or four kittens in May or June. Several other
species very little differing from these are known as the MALABAR, JAVAN,
and BURMESE CIVETS.

The RASSE is smaller, has no erectile crest, and its geographical
distribution extends from Africa to the Far East. It is commonly kept as a
domestic pet. Like all the civets, it will eat fruit and vegetables.

The GENETS, though resembling the civets, have no scent-pouch. They are
African creatures, but are found in Italy, Spain, and Greece, and in
Palestine, and even in the south of France. Beautifully spotted or striped,
they are even longer and lower than the civet-cats, and steal through the
grass like weasels.

AFRICAN CIVET.

This is one of the largest of the Civet Tribe. The perfume known as "civet"
is obtained from it.]

The COMMON GENET is black and grey, the latter being the ground-colour. The
tail is very long, the length being about 15 inches, while that of the body
and head is only 19 inches. Small rodents, snakes, eggs, and birds are its
principal food. It is kept in Southern Europe for killing rats. Several
other very similar forms are found in Africa. The presence of such a very
Oriental-looking animal in Europe is something of a surprise, though many
persons forget that our South European animals are very like those of
Africa and the East. The porcupine, which is common in Italy and Spain, and
the lynx and Barbary ape are instances. A tame genet kept by an
acquaintance of the writer in Italy was absolutely domesticated like a tame
mongoose. It had very pretty fur, grey, marbled and spotted with black, and
no disagreeable odour, except a scent of musk. It was a most active little
creature, full of curiosity, and always anxious to explore not only every
room, but every cupboard and drawer in the house. Perhaps this was due to
its keenness in hunting mice, a sport of which it never tired. It did not
play with the mice when caught as a cat does, but ate them at once.

AFRICAN CIVET.

This photograph shows the finely marked fur of the species and the front
view of the head.]

The LINSANGS, an allied group, are met with in the East, from India to
Borneo and Java. They are more slender than the genets, and more arboreal.
Of the NEPALESE LINSANG Hodgson writes: "This animal is equally at home on
trees and on the ground. It breeds and dwells in the hollows of decaying
trees. It is not gregarious, and preys mainly on living animals." A tame
female owned by him is stated to have been wonderfully docile and
tractable, very sensitive to cold, and very fond of being petted. There is
an allied West African species.

SUMATRAN CIVET.

A small and very beautiful member of the Civet Family. It feeds largely on
fish.]

The PALM-CIVETS and HEMIGALES still further increase this numerous tribe.
Slight differences of skull, of the markings on the tail, which may only
have rings on the base, and of the foot and tail, are the naturalist's
guide to their separation from the other civets; HARDWICKE'S HEMIGALE has
more zebra-like markings. Borneo, Africa, India, and the Himalaya all
produce these active little carnivora; but the typical palm-civets are
Oriental. They are sometimes known as Toddy-cats, because they drink the
toddy from the jars fastened to catch the juice. The groves of
cocoanut-palm are their favourite haunts; but they will make a home in
holes in the thatched roofs of houses, and even in the midst of cities.
There are many species in the group.

The BINTURONG is another omnivorous, tree-haunting animal allied to the
civets; but it has a prehensile tail, which few other mammals of the Old
World possess. It is a blunt-nosed, heavy animal, sometimes called the
Bear-cat. Very little is known of its habits. It is found from the Eastern
Himalaya to Java.

The last of the Civet Family is BENNETT'S CIVET, the only instance of a
cat-like animal with partly webbed feet. Found in the Malay Peninsula and
in Sumatra and Borneo, it is very rare, but is known to feed on fish and
crustacea, and to be semi-aquatic. The author of the chapter on the civets
in the Naturalist's Library says, "It may be likened to a climbing otter."


THE MONGOOSE AND ICHNEUMON FAMILY.

These are a numerous and useful race of small mammals, feeding mainly on
the creatures most annoying to man within tropical countries. Snakes, the
eggs of the crocodile, large lizards, rats, mice, and other creatures known
generally as "vermin," are their favourite food. It must be added that,
though they are most useful in destroying these, they also kill all kinds
of birds, and that their introduction into some of the West India Islands,
for the purpose of killing rats, has been fatal to the indigenous bird
life.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

GENET.

The genets are smaller than some civets, but allied to them. One was
anciently domesticated like a cat.]


THE INDIAN MONGOOSE.

This universal favourite is one of the largest, the head and body being
from 15 to 18 inches long, and the tail 14 inches. The fur is loose and
long, and capable of being erected. As in all the tribe, the tint is a
"pepper and salt," the "pepper" colour being sometimes blackish and
sometimes red, but a speckled appearance characterises the whole group.
This is the animal supposed to be immune from snake-bite. It is possibly so
to some extent, for it kills and eats the poisonous snakes, and it is now
known that the _eating_ of snake-poison tends to give the same protection
as inoculation does against certain diseases. But it is certain that in
most cases the mongoose, by its activity, and by setting up the hair on its
body, which makes the snake "strike short," saves itself from being bitten.

Many descriptions of the encounters between these brave little animals and
the cobra have been written. Here is one of the less known: "One of our
officers had a tame mongoose, a charming little pet. Whenever we could
procure a cobra--and we had many opportunities--we used to turn it out in
an empty storeroom, which had a window at some height from the ground, so
that it was perfectly safe to stand there and look on. The cobra, when
dropped from the bag or basket, would wriggle into one of the corners of
the room and there coil himself up. The mongoose showed the greatest
excitement on being brought to the window, and the moment he was let loose
would eagerly jump down into the room, when his behaviour became very
curious and interesting. He would instantly see where the snake was, and
rounding his back, and making every hair on his body stand out at right
angles, which made his body appear twice as large as it really was, he
would approach the cobra on tip-toe, making a peculiar humming noise. The
snake, in the meantime, would show signs of great anxiety, and I fancy of
fear, erecting his head and hood ready to strike when his enemy came near
enough. The mongoose kept running backwards and forwards in front of the
snake, gradually getting to within what appeared to us to be striking
distance. The snake would strike at him repeatedly, and _appeared_ to hit
him, but the mongoose continued his comic dance, apparently unconcerned.
Suddenly, and with a movement so rapid that the eye could not follow it, he
would pin the cobra by the back of the head. One could hear the sharp teeth
crunch into the skull, and, when all was over, see the mongoose eating the
snake's head and part of his body with great gusto. Our little favourite
killed a great many cobras, and, so far as I could see, never was bitten."

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

TWO-SPOTTED PALM-CIVET.

This is a West African species, which, with an allied form from East
Africa, represents the palm-civets in the Dark Continent.]

The EGYPTIAN MONGOOSE, or ICHNEUMON, has an equally great reputation for
eating the eggs of the crocodile; and the KAFFIR MONGOOSE, a rather larger
South African species, is kept as a domestic animal to kill rats, mice, and
snakes, of which, like the Indian kind, it is a deadly foe. There are more
than twenty other species, most of much the same appearance and habits.

The smooth-nosed mongoose tribe are closely allied creatures in South
Africa, mainly burrowing animals, feeding both on flesh and fruit. The
CUSIMANSES of Abyssinia and West Africa are also allied to them. Their
habits are identical with the above.

MASKED PALM-CIVET.

A whole-coloured species of the group.]


THE MEERKATS, OR SURICATES.

Most people who have read Frank Buckland's Life will remember the suricate
which was his chief pet in Albany Street. The SURICATES, or MEERKATS,
burrow all over the South African veldt, especially in the sandy parts,
where they sit up outside their holes like prairie-dogs, and are seen by
day. They are sociable animals, and make most amusing pets. A full-grown
one is not much larger than a hedgehog, but more slender. It barks like a
prairie-dog, and has many other noises of pleasure or anger. A lady, the
owner of one, writes in _Country Life_: "It gets on well with the dogs and
cats, especially the latter, as they are more friendly to her, and allow
her to sleep by their side and on the top of them. One old cat brings small
birds to her (her favourite is a sparrow), and makes her usual cry, and
Janet runs to her and carries off the bird, which she eats, feathers and
all, in a very few minutes, if she is hungry." When near a farm, the
meerkats will devour eggs and young chickens. They are also said to eat the
eggs of the large leopard-tortoise. The commonest is the SLENDER-TAILED
MEERKAT. It is found all over South Africa, and is very common in the
Karroo. It eats insects and grubs as well as small animals, and is commonly
kept as a pet throughout the Colony.

[Illustration: _Photo by Robert D. Carson_]     [_Philadelphia._

BINTURONG.

The binturong is placed with the civets. It has a prehensile tail like the
kinkajou (see page 127).]



We have now traced the long line of the Carnivora from the lordly Lion, the
slayer of man and his flocks and herds, and the Tiger, equally formidable
and no less specially developed for a life of rapine on a great scale, to
creatures as small and insignificant as the Meerkat, which is at least as
much an insect-feeder as a devourer of flesh, and the Ichneumons and
Civets. The highest form of specialisation in the group is the delicate
mechanism by which the chief weapons of offence, the claws, are enabled to
keep their razor edge by being drawn up into sheaths when the animal walks,
but can be instantly thrust out at pleasure, rigid and sharp as
sword-blades. The gradual process by which this equipment deteriorates in
the Civets and disappears in the Mongoose should be noted. There are many
other carnivora, but none so formidable as those possessing the retractile
claws. Thus the Bears, though often larger in bulk than the Lion, are far
inferior in the power of inflicting violent injury. At the same time such
delicate mechanism is clearly not necessary for the well-being of a
species. The members of the Weasel Tribe are quite as well able to take
care of themselves as the small cats, though they have non-retractile and
not very formidable claws.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

MONGOOSE.

The Indian mongoose is the great enemy of snakes. Another species eats the
eggs of the crocodile.]

Such a very abnormal animal as the BINTURONG--of which we are able to give
an excellent photograph--is doubtless rightly assigned to the place in
which modern science has placed it. But it will be found that there are
several very anomalous forms quite as detached from any general type as is
the binturong. Nature does not make species on any strictly graduated
scale. Many of these nondescript animals are so unlike any other group or
family that they seem almost freaks of nature. The binturong is certainly
one of these.

The next group with which we deal is that of the Hyænas. In these the
equipment for catching living prey is very weak. Speed and pursuit are not
their _métier_, but the eating of dead and decaying animal matter, and the
consumption of bones. Hence the jaws and teeth are highly developed, while
the rest of the body is degenerate.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

MEERKAT.

A small, mainly insectivorous animal, found in South Africa; also called
the Suricate.]

The question of the comparative intelligence of the Apes and Monkeys, and
the carnivorous animals subsequently described in these pages, is an
interesting one. It would seem at first as if the Cat Tribe and their
relations, which have to obtain their prey by constant hunting, and often
to make use of considerable reflection and thought to bring their
enterprises against other animals to a successful issue, would be more
likely to develop intelligence and to improve in brain-power than the great
Apes, which find an easy living in the tropical forests, and only seek
fruits and vegetables for their food. Yet it is quite certain that this is
not the case. The Cat Tribe, with the exception of the domesticated cats,
does not show high intelligence. Even the latter are seldom trained to obey
man, though they learn to accommodate themselves to his ways of life. There
is no evidence that cats have any sense of number, or that any of them in a
wild state make any effort to provide shelter for themselves or construct a
refuge from their enemies, though the Leopard will make use of a cave as a
lair. In matters requiring intelligence and co-operation, such rodents as
the Beaver, or even the Squirrel, are far beyond the feline carnivora in
sagacity and acquired or inherited ingenuity. Except the Stoat, which
sometimes hunts in packs, no species of the carnivora yet dealt with in
this work combines to hunt its prey, or for defence against enemies. Each
for itself is the rule, and even among the less-specialised flesh-eating
animals of the other groups it is only the Dog Tribe which seems to
understand the principles of association for a common object.

CHAPTER IV.

_THE HYÆNAS AND AARD-WOLF._

If every animal has its place in nature, we must suppose that the hyæna's
business is to clear up the bones and such parts of the animal dead as the
vultures and other natural "undertakers" cannot devour. Hyænas have very
strong jaws, capable of crushing almost any bone. In prehistoric times they
were common in England, and lived in the caves of Derbyshire and Devon. In
these caves many bones were found quite smashed up, as if by some very
large wild animal. It was supposed that this was done by bears--Dean
Buckland said "by hyænas." He procured a hyæna, kept it at his house, and
fed it on bones. The smashed fragments he laid on the table at a scientific
lecture beside the fragments from the caverns. The resemblance was
identical, and the Dean triumphed.

The hyænas are carnivorous animals, with the front limbs longer than the
hind. The tail is short, the colour spotted or brindled, the teeth and jaws
of great strength.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

SPOTTED HYÆNA.

The largest of the carrion-feeding animals. A South African species.]

The BROWN HYÆNA, or STRAND-WOLF, is an African species, with very long,
coarse hair, reaching a length of 10 inches on the back. It is not found
north of the Zambesi; and it is nocturnal, and fond of wandering along the
shore, where it picks up crabs and dead fish. Young cattle, sheep, and
lambs are also killed by it, and offal of all kinds devoured.

The SPOTTED HYÆNA is a large and massive animal, the head and body being 4
feet 6 inches long without the tail. It is found all over Africa from
Abyssinia and Senegal southwards. A few are left in Natal. It is believed
to be the same as the cave-hyæna of Europe. By day it lives much in the
holes of the aard-vark (ant-bear); by night it goes out, sometimes in small
bands, to seek food. It has a loud and mournful howl, beginning low and
ending high. It also utters a horrible maniacal laugh when excited, which
gives it the name of Laughing-hyæna. "Its appetite," says Mr. W. L. Sclater
in his "South African Mammals," "is boundless. It is entirely carnivorous,
but seems to prefer putrid and decaying matter, and never kills an animal
unless driven to do so by hunger. Sheep and donkeys are generally attacked
at the belly, and the bowels torn out by its sharp teeth. Horses are also
frequent objects of attack; but in this case shackling is useful, as the
horse, unable to escape, faces the hyæna, which instantly bolts. It is an
excellent scavenger, and it has been known to kill and carry off young
children, though the least attempt at pursuit will cause it to drop them.
Many stories are told, too, of its attacking sleeping natives; in this case
it invariably goes for the man's face. Drummond states that he has seen
many men who had been thus mutilated, wanting noses, or with the whole
mouth and lips torn away. This is confirmed by other authors." Drummond
gives an instance of seven cows being mortally injured in a single night by
two hyænas, which attacked them and bit off the udders. Poisoned meat is
the only means to get rid of this abominable animal.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

SPOTTED HYÆNA.

The jaws of the hyæna are specially made for cracking hones. They will
smash the thigh-bone of a buffalo.]

Sir Samuel Baker says: "I can safely assert that the bone-cracking power of
this animal is extraordinary. I cannot say that it exceeds the lion or
tiger in the strength of its jaws; but they will leave bones unbroken which
a hyæna will crack in halves. Its powers of digestion are unlimited. It
will swallow and digest a knuckle-bone without giving it a crunch, and will
crack the thigh-bone of a buffalo to obtain the marrow, and swallow either
end immediately after.... I remember that once a hyæna came into our tent
at night. But this was merely a friendly reconnaissance, to see if any
delicacy, such as our shoes, or a saddle, or anything that smelt of
leather, were lying about. It was bright moonlight, and the air was calm.
There was nothing to disturb the stillness. I was awakened from sleep by a
light touch on my sleeve, and my attention was directed by my wife to some
object that had just quitted our tent. I took my rifle from beneath the mat
on which I lay, and, after waiting for a few minutes sitting up in bed, saw
a large form standing in the doorway preparatory to entering. Presently it
walked in cautiously, and immediately fell dead, with a bullet between its
eyes. It proved to be a very large hyæna, an old and experienced
depredator, as it bore countless scars of encounters with other strong
biters of its race."

STRIPED HYÆNA.

This is the Hyæna of Northern Africa, Palestine, and India.]

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

AARD-WOLF.

The aard-wolf stands in a family by itself. It is allied to the hyænas, but
is a far feebler animal.]

The STRIPED HYÆNA is found in India as well as in Africa. In portions of
Abyssinia these animals are so numerous that on the Nile tributaries Sir
Samuel Baker used to hear them cracking the bones after supper every night
just as they had been thrown by the Arabs within a few feet of the deserted
table. In this way they are useful scavengers.


THE AARD-WOLF.

This small African hyæna-like creature stands in a family by itself. The
animal is like a small striped hyæna, with a pointed muzzle, longer ears,
and a kind of mane. It is common all through South and East Africa, where
it lives on carrion, white ants, and lambs and kids. It has not the strong
jaws and teeth of the dog or hyæna family. The colonists commonly hunt and
kill it with fox-terriers.

YOUNG GREY WOLF.

The grey wolf of North America, which once preyed mainly on young bison
calves, is now a formidable enemy to the increasing flocks of sheep and
herds of cattle in the north and west.]

CHAPTER V.

_THE DOG FAMILY._

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co., Parson's Green._

A GROWING CUB.

Note how the wolf cub develops the long pasterns, large feet, and long jaw
before its body grows in proportion]

The tribe now treated is called the Dog Family, and rightly so, for our
domestic dogs are included in the group, which comprises the Wolves, Dogs,
Jackals, Wild Dogs, and Foxes. Their general characters are too familiar to
need description, but it should be noted that the foxes differ from the
dogs in having contracting pupils to the eye (which in bright sun closes
like a cat's to a mere slit) and some power of climbing. The origin of the
domestic dog is still unsettled.


THE WOLF.

This great enemy of man and his dependants--the creature against the
ravages of which almost all the early races of Europe had to combine,
either in tribes, villages, or principalities, to protect their children,
themselves, and their cattle--was formerly found all over the northern
hemisphere, both in the Old and New Worlds. In India it is rather smaller,
but equally fierce and cunning, though, as there are no long winters, it
does not gather in packs. It is still so common in parts of the Rocky
Mountains that the cattle and sheep of the ranch-holders and wild game of
the National Yellowstone Park suffer severely. In Switzerland the ancient
organisations of wolf clubs in the cantons are still maintained. In
Brittany the Grand Louvetier is a government official. Every very hard
winter wolves from the Carpathians and Russia move across the frozen rivers
of Europe even to the forests of the Ardennes and of Fontainebleau. In
Norway they ravage the reindeer herds of the Lapps. Only a few years ago an
artist, his wife, and servant were all attacked on their way to Budapest,
in Hungary, and the man and his wife killed. The last British wolf was
killed in 1680 by Cameron of Lochiel. Wolves are common in Palestine,
Persia, and India.

Without going back over the well-known history of the species, we will give
some anecdotes of the less commonly known exploits of these fierce and
dangerous brutes. Mr. Kipling's "Jungle Book" has given us an "heroic"
picture of the life of the Indian wolves. There is a great deal of truth in
it. Even the child-stealing by wolves is very probably a fact, for native
opinion is unanimous in crediting it. Babies laid down by their mothers
when working in the fields are constantly carried off and devoured by them,
and stories of their being spared and suckled by the she-wolves are very
numerous.

Indian wolves hunt in combination, without assembling in large packs. The
following is a remarkable instance, recorded by General Douglas Hamilton:
"When returning with a friend from a trip to the mountain caves of Ellora,
we saw a herd of antelope near a range of low rocky hills; and as there was
a dry nullah, or watercourse, we decided on having a stalk. While creeping
up the nullah, we noticed two animals coming across the plain on our left.
We took them at first for leopards, but then saw that they were wolves.
When they were about 500 yards from the antelope, they lay down quietly.
After about ten minutes or so, the smaller of the two got up and trotted
off to the rocky hills, and suddenly appeared on the ridge, running
backwards and forwards like a Scotch collie dog. The larger wolf, as soon
as he saw that the antelope were fully occupied in watching his companion,
got up and came as hard as he could gallop to the nullah. Unfortunately he
saw us and bolted; and his companion, seeing there was something wrong, did
the same. Now, it is evident that these wolves had regularly planned this
attack. One was to occupy the attention of the antelope, the other to steal
up the watercourse and dash into the midst of them. At another time a
brother-officer of mine was stalking a herd of antelope which were feeding
down a grassy valley, when suddenly a wolf got up before him, and then
another and then another, until fourteen wolves rose out of the grass. They
were extended right across the valley in the shape of a fishing-net or
jelly-bag, so that as soon as the herd had got well into the jelly-bag they
would have rushed on the antelope, and some must have fallen victims to
their attack." They have been known to join in the chase of antelopes by
dogs. Captain Jackson, of the Nizam's service, let his dogs course an
antelope fawn. A wolf jumped up, joined the dogs, and all three seized the
fawn together. He then came up, whipped off the dogs and the wolf, and
secured the fawn, which did not seem hurt. The wolf immediately sat down
and began to howl at the loss of his prey, and in a few moments made a dash
at the officer, but when within a few yards thought better of it, and
recommenced howling. This brought another wolf to his assistance. Both
howled and looked very savage, and seemed inclined to make another dash at
the antelope. But the horse-keepers came up, and the wolves retired.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

WOLF CUBS.

These are evidently the foster-brothers of Romulus and Remus.]

The Indian wolf, if a male, stands about 26 inches high at the shoulder.
The length of head and body is 37 inches; tail, 17 inches.

The same species practically haunts the whole of the world north of the
Himalaya. It varies in colour from almost black to nearly pure white. In
the Hudson Bay fur-sales every variety of colour between these may be seen,
but most are of a tawny brindle. The male grows to a very great size. One
of the largest ever seen in Europe was for years at the London Zoo. It
stood 6 feet high when on its hind legs, and its immense head and jaws
seemed to occupy one-third of the space from nose to tail. Horses are the
main prey of the Northern Wolf. It will kill any living creature, but
horseflesh is irresistible. It either attacks by seizing the flank and
throwing the animal, or bites the hocks. The biting power is immense. It
will tear a solid mass of flesh at one grip from the buttock of a cow or
horse. In the early days of the United States, when Audubon was making his
first trip up the head-waters of the Missouri, flesh of all kinds was
astonishingly abundant on the prairies. Buffalo swarmed, and the Indians
had any quantity of buffalo-meat for the killing. Wolves of very large size
used to haunt the forts and villages, and were almost tame, being well fed
and comfortable. Far different was the case even near St. Petersburg at the
same period. A traveller in 1840 was chased by a pack of wolves so closely
that when the sledge-horses reached the post-house and rushed into the
stable, the doors of which were open, seven of the wolves rushed in after
them. The driver and traveller leaped from the sledge just as it reached
the building, and horses and wolves rushed past them into it. The men then
ran up and closed the doors. Having obtained guns, they opened the roof,
expecting to see that the horses had been killed. Instead all seven wolves
were slinking about beside the terrified horses. All were killed without
resistance.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Midland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

WHITE WOLF.

White wolves are quite common in North America. Recently two white wolves
were brought to the Zoological Gardens from Russia.]

In Siberia and Russia the wolves in winter are literally starving.
Gathering in packs, they haunt the roads, and chase the sledges with their
unfaltering gallop. Seldom in these days does a human life fall victim; but
in very hard winters sledge-horses are often killed, and now and then a
peasant. Rabies is very common among wolves. They then enter the villages,
biting and snapping at every one. Numbers of patients are sent yearly from
Russia and Hungary to the Pasteur Institutes, after being bitten by rabid
wolves. In Livonia, in 1823, it was stated that the following animals had
been killed by wolves: 15,182 sheep, 1,807 oxen, 1,841 horses, 3,270 goats,
4,190 pigs, 703 dogs, and numbers of geese and fowls. They followed the
Grand Army from Russia to Germany in 1812, and restocked the forests of
Europe with particularly savage wolves. It is said that in the retreat from
Moscow twenty-four French soldiers, with their arms in their hands, were
attacked, killed, and eaten by a pack of wolves.

PRAIRIE-WOLF, OR COYOTE.

This is the small, grey, thickly furred species found on the prairies.]

From very early times special breeds of dogs have been trained to guard
sheep against the attacks of wolves. Some of these were intended to defend
the flock on the spot, others to run down the wolves in the open. The
former are naturally bred to be very large and heavy; the latter, though
they must be strong, are light and speedy. Of the dogs which guard the
flocks several races still survive. Among the most celebrated are those of
Albania and the mountainous parts of Turkey, and the wolf-dogs of Tibet,
generally called Tibetan Bloodhounds. The Tartar shepherds on the steppes
near the Caucasus also keep a very large and ferocious breed of dog. All
these are of the mastiff type, but have long, thick hair. When the
shepherds of Albania or Mount Rhodope are driving their flocks along the
mountains to the summer pastures, they sometimes travel a distance of 200
miles. During this march the dogs act as flankers and scouts by day and
night, and do battle with the wolves, which know quite well the routes
along which the sheep usually pass, and are on the look-out to pick up
stragglers or raid the flock. The Spanish shepherds employ a large white
shaggy breed of dog as guards against wolves. These dogs both lead the
sheep and bring up the rear in the annual migration of the flocks to and
from the summer pastures. In the west of America, now that sheep-ranching
on a large scale has been introduced, wolf-dogs are bred to live entirely
with the sheep. They are suckled when puppies by the ewes instead of by
their own mothers, and become as it were a part of the flock.

Colonel Theodore Roosevelt gives an interesting account of wolf-coursing in
Russia, in an article contributed to "The Encyclopædia of Sport" (Lawrence
& Bullen). "In Russia the sport is a science," he writes. "The princes and
great landowners who take part in it have their hunting-equipages equipped
perfectly to the smallest detail. Not only do they follow wolves in the
open, but they capture them and let them out before dogs, like hares in a
closed coursing-meeting. The huntsman follows his hounds on horseback.
(These hounds are the Borzoi, white giant greyhounds, now often seen in
England.) Those in Russia show signs of reversion to the type of the Irish
wolf-hound, dogs weighing something like 100 lbs., of remarkable power, and
of reckless and savage temper. Now three or four dogs are run together.
They are not expected to kill the wolf, but merely to hold him.... The
Borzois can readily overtake and master partly grown wolves, but a
full-grown dog-wolf, in good trim, will usually gallop away from them."

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

"THE WOLF WITH PRIVY PAW."

The photograph shows admirably the slinking gait and long stride of the
wolf.]

A number of these Borzoi dogs have been imported into America, and are used
to course wolves in the Western States. But there professional wolf-hunters
are employed to kill off the creatures near the ranches. One such hunter
lives near Colonel Roosevelt's ranche on the Little Missouri. His pack of
large dogs will tear in pieces the biggest wolf without aid from the
hunter. Of his own efforts in wolf-coursing he writes: "We generally
started for the hunting-ground very early, riding across the open country
in a widely spread line of dogs and men. If we put up a wolf, we simply
went at him as hard as we knew how. Young wolves, or those which had not
attained their full strength, were readily overtaken, and the pack would
handle a she-wolf quite readily. A big dog-wolf, or even a full-grown and
powerful she-wolf, offered an altogether different problem. Frequently we
came upon one after it had gorged itself on a colt or a calf. Under such
conditions, if the dogs had a good start, they ran into the wolf and held
him.... Packs composed of nothing but specially bred and trained greyhounds
of great size and power made a better showing. Under favourable
circumstances three or four of these dogs readily overtook and killed the
largest wolf.... Their dashing courage and ferocious fighting capacity were
marvellous, and in this respect I was never able to see much difference
between the smooth and rough--the Scotch deerhound or the greyhound type."

RUSSIAN WOLF.

This is a most characteristic photograph of one of the so-called "greyhound
wolves" of the Russian forests.]

Wolf cubs are born in April or May. The litter is from four to nine. There
was one of six a few years ago at the Zoological Gardens at the Hague,
pretty little creatures like collie puppies, but quarrelsome and rough even
in their play. When born, they were covered with reddish-white down; later
the coat became woolly and dark.

The European wolf's method of hunting when in chase of deer is by steady
pursuit. Its speed is such and its endurance so great that it can overtake
any animal. But there is no doubt that the favourite food of the wolf is
mutton, which it can always obtain without risk on the wild mountains of
the Near East, if once the guardian dogs are avoided. M. Tschudi, the
naturalist of the Alps, gives a curious account of the assemblage of wolves
in Switzerland in 1799. They had, as is mentioned above, followed the
armies from Russia. Having tasted human flesh, they preferred it to all
other, and even dug up the corpses. The Austrian, French, and Russian
troops penetrated in 1799 into the highest mountain valleys of Switzerland,
and fought sanguinary battles there. Hundreds of corpses were left on the
mountains and in the forests, which acted as bait to the wolves, which were
not destroyed for some years.

Wolves will interbreed with dogs readily, which the red fox will not. The
progeny do not bark, but howl. The Eskimo cross their dogs with wolves to
give them strength.


THE COYOTE, OR PRAIRIE-WOLF.

Besides the large grey wolf, a smaller and less formidable animal is common
on the prairies and mountains of the northern half of the continent of
America. This is the Coyote. It takes the place of the hyæna as a
scavenger, but has some of the habits of the fox. It catches birds and
buck-rabbits, and feeds on insects, as well as small rodents like
prairie-dogs and mice. Its melancholy howls make night hideous on the
northern prairies, and it is the steady foe of all young creatures, such as
the fawns of prong-horned antelope and deer. Its skin, like that of most
northern carnivora, is thick and valuable for fur wraps. The coyotes
assemble in packs like jackals.

In the National Park in the Yellowstone Valley grey wolves and coyotes are
the only animals which it is absolutely necessary to destroy. As the deer
and antelope and other game increased under State protection, the wolves
and coyotes drew towards a quarter where there were no hunters and a good
supply of food. It was soon found that the increase of the game was
checked. The coyotes used to watch the hinds when about to drop their
calves, and usually succeeded in killing them. The large grey wolves killed
the hinds themselves, and generally made life most unpleasant for the
dwellers in this paradise. Orders were issued to kill off all the wolves by
any means. Poison was found to be the best remedy; but in the winter, when
all the game descended into the valleys, the wolves found so much fresh
food in the carcases of the animals they killed for themselves that they
would not eat very eagerly of the poisoned baits. The coyotes were killed
off fairly closely, as they are less able to obtain living prey; but the
grey wolves are constantly reinforced from the mountains, and are a
permanent enemy to be coped with.

A curious instance of change of habit in wolves on the American prairies
was recently noted in the _Spectator_. Formerly they followed the caravans;
now they come down to the great transcontinental railways, and haunt the
line to obtain food. Each train which crosses the prairie is, like a ship,
full of provisions. Three meals a day take place regularly, and these are
not stinted. The black cooks throw all the waste portions--beef-bones,
other bones, stale bread, and trimmings--overboard. The wolves have learnt
that the passing of a train means food, and when they hear one they gallop
down to the line, and wait like expectant dogs in the hope of picking up a
trifle. The coyotes come close to the metals, and sit like terriers, with
their sharp noses pricked up. The big grey wolves also appear in the early
morning, standing on the snow, over which the chill wind of winter blows,
gaunt and hungry images of winter and famine.

INDIAN WOLF.

This photograph shows the Indian wolf alarmed. It has a reputation for
stealing children as well as killing cattle.]

Some years ago experiments were made at the Regent's Park Zoological
Gardens to ascertain if there were any foundation for the old legends that
wolves feared the sound of stringed instruments such as the violin. Every
one will remember the story of the fiddler pursued by wolves. It is said
that as the pack overtook him he broke a string of his instrument, and that
the sudden noise of the parting cord caused the pack to stand still for a
minute, and so enabled him to reach a tree, which he climbed. Further, that
when he improved on the hint so given, and played his fiddle, the wolves
all sat still; when he left off, they leapt up and tried to reach him.
Experiments with the Zoo wolves showed that there was no doubt whatever
that the low minor chords played on a violin cause the greatest fear and
agitation in wolves, both European and Indian. The instrument was first
played behind the den of an Indian wolf, and out of sight. At the first
sound the wolf began to tremble, erected its fur, dropped its tail between
its legs, and crept uneasily across its den. As the sounds grew louder and
more intense, the wolf trembled so violently, and showed such physical
evidence of being dominated by excessive fright, that the keeper begged
that the experiment might be discontinued, or the creature would have a
fit. A large European wolf is described in "Life at the Zoo" as having
exhibited its dislike of the music in a different way. It set up all its
fur till it looked much larger than its ordinary size, and drew back its
lips until all the white teeth protruding from the red gums were shown. It
kept silent till the violin-player approached it; then it flew at him with
a ferocious growl, and tried to seize him.

WOLF'S HEAD.

A very fine study of the head, jaws, and teeth of a female wolf. The head
of the male is much larger.]

There are instances of wolves having been quite successfully tamed, and
developing great affection for their owners. They are certainly more
dog-like than any fox; yet even the fox has been tamed so far as to become
a domesticated animal for the lifetime of one particular individual. An
extraordinary instance of this was lately given in _Country Life_, with a
photograph of the fox. It was taken when a cub, and brought up at a large
country house with a number of dogs. Among these were three terriers, with
which it made friends. There were plenty of wild foxes near, some of which
occasionally laid up in the laurels in a shrubbery not far from the house.
These laurels were, in fact, a fairly safe find for a fox. It was the
particular sport of the terriers to be taken to "draw" this bit of cover,
and to chase out any fox in it. On these expeditions the tame fox
invariably accompanied them, and took an active part in the chase, pursuing
the wild fox as far as the terriers were able to maintain the hunt.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

RUSSIAN WOLF.

Note the expression of fear and ferocity on the face of this wolf; also the
enormously powerful jaws.]

In Central Asia the wolves lie out singly on the steppes during the summer,
and feed on the young antelopes and the lambs and kids of the Tartars'
flocks. The Kirghiz organise wolf-killing parties, to which as many mounted
men and dogs come as can be brought together. In order to aid the dogs, the
Tartars often employ eagles trained to act like falcons, which sit on the
arm of the owner. As the eagle is too heavy to be carried for any time in
this way, a crutch is fastened to the left side of the saddle, on which the
bearer of the falcon rests his arm. When a wolf is sighted, the eagle is
loosed, and at once flies after the wolf, and overtakes it in a short time,
striking at its head and eyes with its talons, and buffeting it with its
wings. This attack so disconcerts the wolf that it gives time for the dogs
to come up and seize it.

The habits of the Siberian wolf are rather different from those in West
Russia, and the settlers and nomad Tartars of Siberia are far more
adventurous and energetic in defending themselves against its ravages than
the peasants of European Russia. Being mounted, they also have a great
advantage in the pursuit. The result is that Siberian wolves seldom appear
in large packs, and very rarely venture to attack man. Yet the damage they
do to the flocks and herds which constitute almost the only property of the
nomad tribes is very severe.

Both the Russians and Siberians believe that when a she-wolf is suckling
her young she carefully avoids attacking flocks in the neighbourhood of the
place where the cubs lie, but that if she be robbed of her whelps she
revenges herself by attacking the nearest flock. On this account the
Siberian peasants rarely destroy a litter, but hamstring the young wolves
and then catch them when partly grown, and kill them for the sake of their
fur. Among the ingenious methods used for shooting wolves in Siberia is
that of killing them from sledges. A steady horse is harnessed to a sledge,
and the driver takes his seat in front as usual. Behind sit two men armed
with guns, and provided with a small pig, which is induced to squeak often
and loudly. In the rear of the sledge a bag of hay is trailed on a long
rope. Any wolf in the forest near which hears the pig concludes that it is
a young wild one separated from its mother. Seeing the hay-bag trailing
behind the sledge in the dusk, it leaps out to seize it, and is shot by the
passengers sitting on the back seat of the sledge.

NORTH AFRICAN JACKAL.

This is the common jackal of Cairo and Lower Egypt.]


THE JACKAL.

Of the Wild Canine Family, the JACKAL is the next in numbers and importance
to the wolves. Probably in the East it is the most numerous of any. In
India, Egypt, and Syria it regularly haunts the outskirts of cities, and
lives on refuse. In the Indian plains wounded animals are also killed by
the jackals. At night the creatures assemble in packs, and scour the
outskirts of the cities. Horrible are the howlings and weird the cries of
these hungry packs. In Ceylon they live in the hills and open country like
foxes, and kill the hares. When taken young jackals can be tamed, and have
all the manners of a dog. They wag their tails, fawn on their master, roll
over and stick up their paws, and could probably be domesticated in a few
generations, were it worth while. They eat fruits and vegetables, such as
melons and pumpkins, eagerly.

In Africa two species are found--the BLACK-BACKED JACKAL and the STRIPED
JACKAL; the former is the size of a large English fox. The young jackals
are born in holes or earths; six seems to be the usual number of puppies.
They have nearly always a back door by which they can escape; this is just
large enough for the puppies to squeeze through, whatever their size. When
fox-terriers are put into the earth, the jackal puppies fly out of their
back doors, through which, as a rule, the terriers are unable to follow
them. Should there be no one outside, the puppies race out on to the veldt
as hard as they can go. This jackal is terribly destructive to sheep and
lambs in the Colony. A reward of 7s. 6d. per tail is paid to the Kaffirs
for killing them. The SIDE-STRIPED JACKAL is a Central African species,
said to hunt in packs, to interbreed with domestic dogs, and to be most
easily tamed.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

INDIAN JACKAL.

This Indian Jackal might be sitting for his portrait in Mr. Rudyard
Kipling's tale of the "undertakers"--the jackal, alligator, and adjutant.]

Both in India and South Africa the jackal has been found to be of some
service to the white man by providing him with a substitute for the fox to
hunt. It has quite as remarkable powers of endurance as the fox, though it
does not fight in the same determined way when the hounds overtake it. But
it is not easy to estimate the courage of a fox when in difficulties. The
writer has known one, when coursed by two large greyhounds, to disable both
almost instantaneously. One was bitten across the muzzle, the other through
the foot. The fox escaped without a bite from either. In India the hounds
used are drafts from English packs. The hot weather does not suit them, and
they are seldom long-lived; but while they are in health they will run a
jackal across the Indian plains as gaily as they would a fox over the
Hampshire Downs. The meet is very early in the morning, as the scent then
lies, and riding is not too great an exertion. The ground drawn is not the
familiar English covert, but fields, watercourses, and old buildings. A
strong dog-jackal goes away at a great pace, and as the ground is open the
animal is often in view for the greater part of the run; but it keeps well
ahead of the hounds often for three or four miles, and if it does not
escape into a hole or ruin is usually pulled down by them. Major-General R.
S. S. Baden-Powell has written and illustrated an amusing account of his
days with the fox-hounds of South Africa hunting jackals. The local Boer
farmers, rough, unkempt, and in ragged trousers, used to turn up smoking
their pipes to enjoy the sport with the smartly got-up English officers.
When once the game was found, they were just as excited as the Englishmen,
and on their Boer ponies rode just as hard, and with perhaps more judgment.

TURKISH JACKAL.

This jackal is common in both Turkey in Europe and in Asia. Near
Constantinople it feeds largely on the bodies buried in the cemeteries at
Scutari.]

Jackals are said to be much increasing in South Africa since the outbreak
of the war. The fighting has so far arrested farming operations that the
war usually maintained on all beasts which destroy cattle or sheep has been
allowed to drop. In parts of the more hilly districts both the jackal and
the leopard are reappearing where they have not been common for years, and
it will take some time before these enemies of the farmer are destroyed.


THE MANED WOLF.

This is by far the largest of several peculiar South American species of
the Dog Family which we have not room to mention. It occurs in Paraguay and
adjoining regions, and is easily distinguishable by its long limbs and
large ears. It is chestnut-red in colour, with the lower part of the legs
black, and is solitary in its habits.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

WILD DOG.

These animals range from the plains of India and Burma to the Tibetan
Plateau and Siberia. They hunt in small packs, usually by day, and are very
destructive to game, but seldom attack domestic animals.]


THE WILD DOG OF AFRICA, OR CAPE HUNTING-DOG.

This is a most interesting creature, differing from the true dogs in having
only four toes on both fore and hind feet, and in being spotted like a
hyæna. These dogs are the scourge of African game, hunting in packs. Long
of limb and swift of foot, incessantly restless, with an overpowering
desire to snap and bite from mere animal spirits, the Cape wild dog, even
when in captivity and attached to its master, is an intractable beast. In
its native state it kills the farmers' cattle and sheep and the largest
antelopes. A pack has been seen to kill and devour to the last morsel a
large buck in fifteen minutes. Drummond says: "It is a marvellous sight to
see a pack of them hunting, drawing cover after cover, their sharp
bell-like note ringing through the air, while a few of the fastest of their
number take up their places along the expected line of the run, the wind,
the nature of the ground, and the habits of the game being all taken into
consideration with wonderful skill." The same writer says that he has seen
them dash into a herd of cattle feeding not a hundred yards from the house,
drive out a beast, disappear over a rising ground, kill it, and pick its
bones before a horse could be saddled and ridden to the place.

DINGOES.

The destruction done to the flocks of the settlers by the dingoes caused
the latter to combine and almost to destroy these wild dogs.]


THE INDIAN WILD DOGS.

Mr. Rudyard Kipling's stories of the "Dhole," the red dogs of the Indian
jungle, have made the world familiar with these ferocious and wonderfully
bold wild dogs. There is very little doubt that they were found in historic
times in Asia Minor. Possibly the surviving stories of the "Gabriel hounds"
and other ghostly packs driving deer alone in the German and Russian
forests, tales which remain even in remote parts of England, are a survival
of the days when the wild dogs lived in Europe. At present there is one
species of long-haired wild dog in West Central Siberia. These dogs killed
nearly all the deer in the large forests near Omsk some years ago. Across
the Himalaya there are several species, one of them as far east as Burma;
but the most famous are the RED DOGS OF THE DECCAN. They frequent both the
jungles and the hills; but their favourite haunt is the uplands of the
Indian Ghats. They are larger than a jackal, much stronger, and hunt in
packs. They have only ten teeth on each side, instead of eleven, as in the
other dogs and foxes. There is no doubt that these fierce hunting-dogs
actually take prey from the tiger's jaws, and probably attack the tiger
itself. They will beset a tiger at any time, and the latter seems to have
learnt from them an instinctive fear of dogs. Not so the leopard, which,
being able to climb, has nothing to fear even from the "dhole." A
coffee-planter, inspecting his grounds, heard a curious noise in the forest
bordering his estate. On going round the corner of a thick bush, he almost
trod on the tail of a tiger standing with his back towards him. He silently
retreated, but as he did so he saw that there was a pack of wild dogs a few
paces in front of the tiger, yelping at him, and making the peculiar noise
which had previously attracted his attention. Having procured a rifle, he
returned with some of his men to the spot. The tiger was gone, but they
disturbed a large pack of wild dogs feeding on the body of a stag. This, on
examination, proved to have been killed by the tiger, for there were the
marks of the teeth in its neck. The dogs had clearly driven the tiger from
his prey and appropriated it. The dread of the tiger for these wild dogs
was discovered by the sportsmen of the Nilgiri Hills, and put to a good
use. They used to collect scratch packs and hunt up tigers in the woods.
The tiger, thinking they were the dreaded wild pack, would either leave
altogether or scramble into a tree. As tigers never do this ordinarily, it
shows how wild dogs get on their nerves.

Several South American wild dogs and foxes are included in the series with
the wolves and jackals. Among these are AZARA'S DOG and the RACCOON-DOG.
These are commonly called foxes, though they have wolf-like skulls.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

CAPE HUNTING-DOG.

This animal hunts in packs. It is very active and most destructive to large
game of many kinds.]


THE DINGO.

The only non-marsupial animal of Australia when the continent was
discovered was the WILD DOG, or DINGO. Its origin is not known; but as soon
as the settlers' flocks and herds began to increase its ravages were most
serious, though doubtless some of the havoc with which it was accredited
was due in a great measure to runaways from domestication. Anyhow, in the
dingo the settlers found the most formidable enemy with which they had to
contend, and vigorous measures were taken to reduce their numbers and
minimise their ravages, so that by now they are nearly exterminated in Van
Diemen's Land and rare on the mainland of Australia.

It is a fine, bold dog, of considerable size, generally long-coated, of a
light tan colour, and with pricked-up ears. It is easily tamed, and some of
those kept in this country have made affectionate pets. Puppies are
regularly bred and sold at the Zoological Gardens. The animal has an
elongated, flat head which is carried high; the fur is soft, and the tail
bushy. In the wild state it is very muscular and fierce.

HIMALAYAN BLACK BEAR.

This photograph shows the most active climber of the two Himalayan bears.]

THE FOXES.

FOXES form a very well-marked group. They have very pointed muzzles, strong
though slightly built bodies, very fine thick fur, often beautifully
coloured and very valuable, bushy tails, pricked-up ears, and eyes with
pupils which contract by day into a mere slit. They are quite distinct from
dogs (although wolves are not), and will not interbreed, though stories are
told to the contrary. The smell of a fox is disgusting to a dog, and quite
sufficient to distinguish it.

FOX CUBS.

Fox cubs are born from March 25 till three weeks later, the time when young
rabbits, their best food, are most numerous.]

If the present writer takes a simpler view of the kinds and species of
foxes than that adopted by many naturalists, he must plead to a study of
the subject on slightly different lines than those usually followed. The
skins of all foxes are valuable, some more than others. But they are sent
in hundreds of thousands, and from all parts of the northern hemisphere, to
London to the great fur-sales. There these differences can be studied as
they can be studied nowhere else. As the habits and structure of foxes are
much alike, allowing for differences of climate, and the discrepancies in
size, not more than can be accounted for by abundance or scarcity of food,
it seems pretty certain that these animals are some of the few, almost
alone among mammals, showing almost every variety of colouring, from black
to white, from splendid chameleon-red to salmon-pink, and many exquisite
shades of brown, grey, and silver. At the Hudson Bay Company's sales you
may see them all, and trace the differences and gradations over whole
continents. The most important are those of North America. There the RED
CANADIAN FOX, of a ruddier hue than brown, shades off into the yellow and
grey CROSS FOX of farther north. But of these there are many varieties.
Then farther north still comes an area where red foxes, cross foxes, and
black foxes are found. The black fox, when the fur is slightly sprinkled
with white, is the famous SILVER FOX. This and the black fox are also found
in North Siberia and Manchuria. Farthest north we find the little stunted
ARCTIC FOXES. In the Caucasus and Central Asia large yellowish-red foxes
live, and in Japan and China a very bright red variety. A small grey fox
lives in Virginia, and is hunted with hounds descended from packs taken out
before the American Revolution. India has its small DESERT-FOXES ("the
little foxes that eat the grapes") and the BENGAL FOX.

[Illustration: _Photo by G. W. Wilson & Co., Ltd._]     [_Aberdeen._

MOUNTAIN-FOX.

In hilly countries the fox becomes a powerful and destructive animal,
killing not only game but lambs.]

The value of the foxes as fur-bearing animals is immense. Only white, blue,
and black skins seem to be appreciated in England. The black fox has been
known to fetch 150 guineas a skin. But in the East, from Asia Minor to
China, red, grey, and yellow fox-skins are the lining of every rich man's
winter wraps. Splendid mixed robes are made by the Chinese by inserting
portions of cross fox-skins into coats of cut sable, giving the idea that
it is the fur of a new animal.

LEICESTERSHIRE FOX.

Leicestershire is the best fox-hunting county in England. The foxes are
famous for their speed and endurance.]

The COMMON FOX, the foundation or type of all the above, is the best-known
carnivorous animal in this country. Abroad its habits do not greatly
differ, except that, not being hunted much with hounds, it is less
completely nocturnal. It drops its young in an earth early in April.
Thither the vixen carries food till late in June, when the cubs come out,
and often move to a wood or a corn-field. There they are still fed, but
learn to do a little on their own account by catching mice and moles. By
late September the hounds come cub-hunting, partly to kill off superfluous
foxes, partly to educate the young hounds, and to teach the foxes to fear
them and to make them leave cover easily. Four or five cubs in a litter are
commonly seen. The distance which a fox will run is extraordinary. The
following is a true account of one of the most remarkable runs ever known.
The hounds were those of Mr. Tom Smith, master of the Hambledon Hunt. He
was the man of whom another famous sportsman said that if he were a fox he
should prefer to be hunted by a pack of hounds rather than by Tom Smith
with a stick in his hand. The fox was found in a cover called Markwells, at
one o'clock in the afternoon in December, near Petersfield. It crossed into
Sussex, and ran into an earth in Grafham Hill a little before dark. The fox
had gone twenty-seven miles. The hounds had forty miles to go back to
kennel that night, and three only found their way home four days
afterwards. Dog-foxes assemble in considerable numbers when a vixen is
about in spring, and at all times common foxes are sociable creatures,
though not actually living in societies. Sometimes as many as five or six
are found in a single earth. Two years ago five foxes and a badger were
found in one near Romford. They eat mice, beetles, rats, birds, game,
poultry, and frogs. Their favourite food is rabbits. If there are plenty of
these, they will not touch other game. They hunt along the railway-lines
for dead birds killed by the telegraph-wires. In the New Forest they also
go down to the shore and pick up dead fish. One in the writer's possession
was shot when carrying away a lamb from a sheepfold near the cliffs of
Sidmouth, in Devon. The shepherd thought it was a marauding dog, and lay in
wait with a gun.

TOO DIFFICULT!

Foxes can easily climb trees with small projecting branches. One was found
87 feet up a tree in Savernake Forest; but a branchless stump such as that
here shown no fox could climb.]


THE ARCTIC FOX.

ARCTIC FOX.

_In summer._    _Changing his coat._    _In winter._

The Arctic Fox is one of the few animals showing different phases of
colour, some being blue at all seasons, while others are white in winter
and mottled brownish in summer.]

The ARCTIC FOX is somewhat different in habits from others. It is also much
smaller than the red foxes. Its fur is almost as soft as eiderdown, and so
thick that the cold does not penetrate. In winter the whole coat changes
colour, not gradually, but in patches. At the same time a dense growth of
under-fur comes up on the body. In summer this is shed in patches, almost
like loose felt. The foxes live in colonies, but are so hard put to it for
food in the winter that they desert their homes to gather round
whaling-ships or encampments. There they steal everything edible, from
snowshoe-thongs to seal-flesh. Blue foxes are bred and kept for the sake of
their fur on some of the islands in Bering Sea. They are fed on the flesh
of the seals killed on the neighbouring islands, and are, like them, killed
when their coat is in condition.


THE FENNECS.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

FENNEC-FOX.

Remarkable for the great size of the ears. An African species. Its sense of
hearing is probably very acute.]

Africa has a group of small foxes of its own. They have very large ears and
dark eyes. Some of them remind us of the Maholis and other large-eyed
lemuroids. Several are not more than 9 or 10 inches long; they are a
whitish-khaki colour, but the eyes are very dark and brilliant.

The COMMON FENNEC is found over the whole of Africa. Its favourite food is
dates and any sweet fruit, but it is also fond of eggs, and will eat mice
and insects. It is probably the original hero of the story of the fox and
the grapes. The large-eared fennec, which is sometimes called the SILVER
FOX, is found from the Cape to as far north as Abyssinia. It is 23 inches
long, and lives mainly on insects and fruit.


DOMESTIC DOGS.

BY C. H. LANE.

The DOG, almost without exception, shows a marked liking for the society of
human beings, and adapts itself to their ways more than any other animal.

Fox-, Stag-, and Hare-hounds--the latter better known as Hariers and
Beagles--have many points in common, much beauty of shape and colour, and
great suitability for their work, though differing in some other
particulars.

Another group--Greyhounds, Whippets, Irish Wolf-hounds, Scottish
Deer-hounds, all of which come under the category of Gaze-hounds, or those
which hunt by sight--are built for great speed, to enable them to cope with
the fleet game they pursue. In the same group should be included the
BORZOI, or Russian Wolf-hound, now very popular in this country, with
something of the appearance of the Scottish deer-hound about it as to
shape, but with a finer, longer head, deeper body, more muscular limbs, and
shaggier in the hair on body and tail.

The OTTER-HOUND is one of the most picturesque of all the hound tribe. This
variety somewhat reminds one of a large and leggy Dandie Dinmont terrier,
with a touch of the blood-hound, and is thought to have been originally
produced from a cross between these or similar varieties.

The BLOOD-HOUND is another, with much style and beauty of shape, colour,
and character about it which cannot fail to favourably impress any
beholder. The matches or trials which have of late years been held in
different localities have been most interesting in proving its ability for
tracking footsteps for long distances, merely following them by scent, some
time after the person hunted started on the trail. By the kindness of my
friend Mr. E. Brough, I am able to give as an illustration a portrait of
what he considers the best blood-hound ever bred.

[Illustration: _Photo by F. H. Dembrey_]     [_Bristol._

STAG-HOUND PUPPIES.

This gives an interesting group of hounds in kennel.]

Much valued by sportsmen with the gun are POINTERS, so called from their
habit of remaining in a fixed position when their quarry is discovered,
eagerly pointing in its direction until the arrival of the guns. They are
most often white, with liver, lemon, or black markings; but occasionally
self colours, such as liver or black, are met with. They have been largely
bred in the west of England. I have been fortunate in obtaining one of Mr.
E. C. Norrish's celebrated strain as a typical specimen for illustration.

[Illustration: _Photo by T. Fall_]     [_Baker Street._

GREYHOUND.

A typical specimen of this elegant variety.]

The SETTER group, which comprises three varieties, are all useful and
beautiful in their way. The English are usually white, with markings or
tickings of blue, lemon, or black; they are rather long and narrow in the
head, with bodies and sterns well feathered, and are graceful and active
movers. Gordon setters, which are always black and tan in colour, and
preferred without any white, are generally larger and stronger in build
than the last-named. Irish setters are more on the lines of the English,
being a rich tawny red in colour, rather higher on the leg, with narrow
skulls, glossy coats, feathered legs and stern, ears set low and lying
back, and lustrous, expressive eyes.

RETRIEVERS may be divided into flat-coated and curly-coated. Both are
usually black, but other colours are occasionally seen. The coats of the
first-named are full, but without curl in them; while the latter have their
bodies, heads, legs, thighs, and even tails covered with small close curls.
The eyes of both should be dark, and the ears carried closely to the sides
of the head. In an article dealing with retrievers, which appeared in the
_Cornhill Magazine_ under the title of "Dogs which Earn their Living," the
author writes: "There is not the slightest doubt that in the modern
retrievers acquired habits, certainly one acquired habit, that of fetching
dead and wounded game, are transmitted directly. The puppies sometimes
retrieve without being taught, though with this they also combine a greatly
improved capacity for further teaching. Recently a retriever was sent after
a winged partridge which had run into a ditch. The dog followed it some way
down the ditch, and presently came out with an old rusty tea-kettle, held
in its mouth by the handle. The kettle was taken from the dog, amid much
laughter; then it was found that inside the kettle was the partridge! The
explanation was that the bird, when wounded, ran into the ditch, which was
narrow. In the ditch was the old kettle, with no lid on. Into this the bird
crept; and as the dog could not get the bird out, it very properly brought
out the kettle with the bird in it. Among dogs which earn their living,
these good retrievers deserve a place in the front rank." The illustration
shows a good flat-coated retriever at work.

The SPANIEL group is rather large, including the English and Irish
water-spaniels, the former an old-fashioned, useful sort, often liver or
roan, with some white or other markings, and a good deal of curl in the
coat and on the ears. His Irish brother is always some shade of liver in
colour, larger in the body and higher on the leg, covered with a curly
coat, except on the tail, which is nearly bare of hair, with a profusion of
hair on the top of the head, often hanging down over the eyes, giving a
comical appearance, and increasing his Hibernian expression. They make
lively, affectionate companions and grand assistants at waterfowl-shooting.

RETRIEVER.

This represents a flat-coated retriever at work, and is remarkably true to
life.]

[Illustration: BLOOD-HOUND.

This photograph shows what an almost perfect blood-hound should be like.]

CLUMBER SPANIELS are always a creamy white, with lemon or light tan
markings, and are rather slow and deliberate in their movements, but have a
stylish, high-class look about them.

SUSSEX SPANIELS are also rather heavy in build and of muscular frame, but
can do a day's work with most others. They are a rich copper-red in colour,
with low short bodies, long feathered ears, full eyes of deep colour, and
are very handsome.

BLACK SPANIELS should be glossy raven-black in colour, with strong muscular
bodies on strong short legs, long pendulous ears, and expressive eyes. Good
specimens are in high favour, and command long prices. I regret I cannot
find room for an illustration of this breed, so deservedly popular.

COCKERS, which are shorter in the back, higher on the leg, and lighter in
weight, being usually under 25 lbs., are very popular, full of life, and
very attractive in appearance.

BASSET-HOUNDS, both rough- and smooth-coated, are probably the most
muscular dogs in existence of their height, with much dignity about them.
In the Sporting Teams at the Royal Agricultural Hall there were some
thirteen or fifteen teams of all kinds of sporting dogs, and of these a
team each of rough and smooth bassets was in the first four.

DACHSHUNDS are often erroneously treated as Sporting Dogs. There are
certainly not so many supporters of the breed as formerly. Their lean
heads, with long hanging ears, long low bodies, and crooked fore legs, give
them a quaint appearance. The colours are usually shades of chestnut-red or
black and tan; but some are seen chocolate and "dappled," which is one
shade of reddish brown, with spots and blotches of a darker shade all over
it.

SMOOTH-COATED SAINT BERNARD.

The illustration gives a capital idea of these handsome dogs.]

GREAT DANES, though mostly classed amongst Non-sporting Dogs, have much of
the hound in their bearing and appearance. The whole-coloured are not so
popular as the various shades of brindle and harlequin, but I have seen
many beautiful fawns, blues, and other whole colours. They are being bred
with small natural drooping ears. One of the first I remember seeing
exhibited was a large harlequin belonging to the late Mr. Frank Adcock,
with the appropriate name of "Satan," as, although always shown muzzled, he
required the attentions of three or four keepers to deal with him; and at
one show I attended he overpowered his keepers, got one of them on the
ground, tore his jacket off, and gave him a rough handling.


NON-SPORTING VARIETIES.

SAINT BERNARDS, although sometimes exceeding 3 feet at the shoulder, are as
a rule very docile and good-tempered, and many are owned by ladies. The
coat may be rough or smooth, according to taste; but either are splendid
animals. They are sometimes seen self-coloured, but those with
markings--shades of rich red, with white and black, for preference--are the
handsomest. They are still used as "first aids" in the snow on the Swiss
mountains. So far as I remember, this is the only breed of dog used for
stud and exhibition for which as much as £1,500 has been paid; and this has
occurred on more than one occasion.

[Illustration: _Photo by Fratelli Alinari_]     [_Florence._

GREAT DANE.

This shows a typical specimen of this breed, with cropped ears, which will
be discontinued in show dogs.]

NEWFOUNDLANDS have regained their place in popularity, and many good blacks
and black-and-whites can now be seen. Numerous cases are on record of their
rendering aid to persons in danger of drowning, and establishing
communication with wrecked vessels and the shore.

MASTIFFS are looked on as one of the national breeds. Their commanding
presence and stately manner make them highly suitable as guards, and they
are credited with much attachment and devotion to their owners. The colours
are mostly shades of fawn with black muzzle, or shades of brindle. I am
able to give the portrait of one of the best specimens living, belonging to
Mr. R. Leadbetter.

BULL-DOGS are also regarded as a national breed. They are at present in
high favour. The sizes and colours are so various that all tastes can be
satisfied. Recently there has been a fancy for toy bull-dogs, limited to 22
lbs. in weight, mostly with upright ears of tulip shape. In spite of the
many aspersions on their character, bull-dogs are usually easy-going and
good-tempered, and are often very fastidious feeders--what fanciers call
"bad doers."

ROUGH COLLIES are very graceful, interesting creatures, and stand first in
intelligence amongst canines. They are highly popular. Several have been
sold for over £1,000, and the amounts in prize-money and fees obtained by
some of the "cracks" would surprise persons not in "the fancy." A high-bred
specimen "in coat" is most beautiful. The colours most favoured are sables
with white markings; but black, white, and tans, known as "tricolors," are
pleasing and effective. I quite hoped to give a portrait of one of the most
perfect of present-day champions, belonging to H.H. the Princess de
Montglyon, but could not find room.

SMOOTH COLLIES are a handsome breed, full of grace, beauty, and
intelligence, and very active and lively. A favourite colour is merle, a
sort of lavender, with black markings and tan and white in parts, usually
associated with one or both eyes china-coloured. Specimens often win in
sheep-dog trials; a bitch of mine won many such, and was more intelligent
in other ways than many human beings.

OLD ENGLISH SHEEP-DOGS are a most fascinating breed, remarkably active,
possessed of much endurance and resource, and very faithful and
affectionate. I have often made long journeys through cross-country roads
accompanied by one or more of them, and never knew them miss me, even on
the darkest night or in the crowded streets of a large town. The favourite
colour is pigeon-blue, with white collar and markings. The coat should be
straight and hard in texture. The illustration is from a portrait of one of
the best bitches ever shown, belonging to Sir H. de Trafford.

[Illustration: _Photo by T. Fall_]     [_Baker Street._

BULL-DOGS.

The photograph is remarkably good and characteristic of this variety.]

DALMATIANS are always white, with black, liver, or lemon spots, the size of
a shilling or less, evenly distributed over the body, head, ears, and even
tail, and pure, without mixture of white. There is much of the pointer
about this variety, which has long been used for sporting purposes on the
continent of Europe. I can testify to their many good qualities as
companions and house-dogs. To quote again from the article above mentioned:
"It is commonly believed that the spotted carriage-dogs once so frequently
kept in England were about the most useless creatures of the dog kind,
maintained only for show and fashion. This is a mistake. They were used at
a time when a travelling-carriage carried, besides its owners, a large
amount of valuable property, and the dog watched the carriage at night when
the owners were sleeping at country inns. We feel we owe an apology to the
race of carriage-dogs.... While this dog is becoming extinct, in spite of
his useful qualities, other breeds are invading spheres of work in which
they had formerly no part." There is only one point in which I differ from
the above, and that is contained in the last sentence. There are a number
of enthusiastic breeders very keen on reviving interest in this variety,
and I have during the last few years had large entries to judge, so that we
shall probably see more of them in the future.

POODLES are of many sizes and colours. They are very intelligent, easily
taught tricks, and much used as performing dogs. They have various kinds of
coats: _corded_, in which the hair hangs in long strands or ringlets;
_curly_, with a profusion of short curls all over them, something like
retrievers; and _fluffy_, when the hair is combed out, to give much the
appearance of fleecy wool. A part of the body, legs, head, and tail is
usually shorn.

[Illustration: OLD ENGLISH SHEEP-DOG.

This is a remarkably fine photograph of a well-known specimen of this
interesting variety.]

BULL-TERRIERS are now bred with small natural drooping ears, and should
have long wedge-shaped heads, fine coats, and long tails. There is also a
toy variety, which hitherto has suffered from round skulls and tulip ears,
but is rapidly improving. I have bred many as small as 3 lbs. in weight. In
each variety the colour preferred is pure white, without any markings, and
with fine tapering tails.

IRISH TERRIERS are very popular, and should be nearly wholly red in colour,
with long lean heads, small drooping ears, hard coats, not too much leg,
and without coarseness. They make good comrades.

BEDLINGTON TERRIERS have long been popular in the extreme north of England,
and are another fighting breed. It is indeed often difficult to avoid a
difference of opinion between show competitors. Their lean long heads,
rather domed skulls, with top-knot of lighter hair, long pointed ears, and
small dark eyes, give them a peculiar appearance. The coats, which are
"linty" in texture, should be shades of blue or liver.

Three breeds, all more or less hard in coat-texture, and grizzled in colour
on heads and bodies, while tanned on other parts, are AIREDALE, OLD
ENGLISH, and WELSH TERRIERS, which may be divided into large, medium, and
small. The first-named make very good all-round dogs; the Old English, less
in number, make useful dogs, and are hardy and companionable; while Welsh
terriers are much the size of a small wire-haired fox-terrier, but usually
shorter and somewhat thicker in the head. I intended one of Mr. W. S.
Glynn's best dogs to illustrate the last-named.

FOX-TERRIERS are both smooth- and wire-haired. Their convenient size and
lively temperament make them very popular as pets and companions for both
sexes and all ages. The colour is invariably white, with or without
markings on head or body, or both.

BLACK-AND-TAN and WHITE ENGLISH TERRIERS are built upon the same lines,
differing chiefly in colour, the former being raven-black, with tan
markings on face, legs, and some lower parts of the body, and the latter
pure white all over. Both should have small natural drooping ears, fine
glossy coats, and tapering sterns. The toy variety of the former should be
a miniature of the larger, and is very difficult to produce of first-class
quality.

The photograph gives an excellent idea of this somewhat rare variety.]

SCOTTISH TERRIERS are very interesting, often with much "character" about
them. The usual colours are black, shades of grey, or brindle, but some are
seen fawn, stone-colour, and white. The ears should be carried bolt
upright, the coat as hard as a badger's, teeth even, small dark expressive
eyes, fore legs straight, the back short. One I brought from Skye many
years since I took with me when driving some miles into the country; coming
back by a different route, he missed me; but on nearing my starting-point I
found him posted at a juncture of four roads, by one of which I must
return. He could not have selected a better position. The illustration is
that of a first-rate specimen of the variety, "Champion Balmacron Thistle."

HER MAJESTY QUEEN ALEXANDRA, WITH CHOW AND JAPANESE SPANIELS.

A group which will be studied with much interest by all.]

DANDIE DINMONT TERRIERS have many quaint and charming ways. They are very
strongly built, being among the most muscular of the terriers, of high
courage, devotedly attached to their owners, and admirably adapted for
companions, being suitable for indoors or out, and at home anywhere. The
colours are pepper (a sort of darkish iron-grey) and mustard (a yellowish
red fawn), both with white silky hair on head, called the top-knot, and
lustrous dark eyes, very gipsy-like and independent in expression.

SKYES, both PRICK- and DROP-EARED, are another Scottish breed which well
deserve their popularity, as they are thorough sporting animals. The
colours are chiefly shades of dark or light grey, but sometimes fawn with
dark points and whites are seen. The texture of coat should be hard and
weather-resisting; the eyes dark and keen in expression; bodies long, low,
and well knit; legs straight in front; even mouths; tails carried gaily,
but not curled over the back.

SCHIPPERKES are of Belgian origin. To those who do not know them, they are
something like medium-sized Pomeranians, short of coat, but without tails.
They are nearly always pure black in colour, with coats of hardish texture,
fullest round the neck and shoulders, the ears standing straight up like
darts, short cobby bodies, and straight legs. They make smart guards and
companions.

[Illustration: _Photo by T. Fall_]     [_Baker Street._

SAND-DOG.

A quaint picture of a quaint variety, quite hairless, and much the colour
of Castille soap.]

CHOWS originally came from China, but are now largely bred here. They are
square-built sturdy dogs, with dense coats, tails carried over the side,
blunt-pointed ears, and rather short thick heads. They have a little of a
large coarse Pomeranian, with something of an Eskimo about them, but are
different from either, with a type of their own. The colour is usually some
shade of red or black, often with a bluish tinge in it. One marked
peculiarity is that the tongues of chows are blue-black in colour.

POMERANIANS can be procured of any weight from 3 to 30 lbs., and of almost
every shade of colour. At present brown of various shades is much in
favour, but there are many beautiful whites, blacks, blues, sables, and
others. They are very sharp and lively, and make charming pets and
companions. Really good specimens command high prices. The illustration is
of one of the best of his colour ever seen--"Champion Pippin."

PUGS, both fawn and black, are old-fashioned favourites very quaint and
peculiar in appearance. They should have square heads and muzzles, with
small ears, large protruding eyes, short thick bodies, and tails tightly
curled over the back. The illustration, "Duchess of Connaught," is of a
well-known winner.

MALTESE TERRIERS are very beautiful when pure bred. They have a long
straight coat of silky white hair nearly reaching the ground, black nose
and eyes, and the tail curled over the back of their short cobby body.
Their beauty well repays the trouble of keeping them in good condition. The
illustration, from a photograph taken for this article, is that of the
high-class dog "Santa Klaus."

PUG AND PEKINESE SPANIEL.

A typical portrait of two well-known winners in these popular varieties.]

YORKSHIRE TOY TERRIERS, with their steel-blue bodies and golden-tanned
faces, legs, and lower parts, and long straight coats, require skilful
attention to keep in order, but are very attractive as pets.

TOY SPANIELS are very old members of the toy division, dating from or
before the time of His Majesty King Charles: KING CHARLES SPANIELS being
black and tan; PRINCE CHARLES SPANIELS black, white, and tan; another
strain, the BLENHEIM, white, with shades of reddish-tan markings on the
head and body, and a spot of same colour on forehead; and the RUBY, a rich
coppery red all over. They should be small and stout in size and shape,
without coarseness, long in the ear, with large full protruding eyes of
dark colour, a short face, a straight coat, and not leggy.

JAPANESE SPANIELS carry heavy coats, usually black, or yellow, and white in
colour, shorter in the ears, which are carried more forward than in the
last-named, broader in the muzzle, with nearly flat faces, dark eyes, and
bushy tails carried over the back. They have very short legs, and their
hair nearly reaches the ground as they walk. When I kept them they were
much larger in size, but they are often now produced under 6 lbs. in
weight.

FOX-TERRIER.

A picture full of life and go--at present odds in favour of our friend with

PEKIN SPANIELS, the last of the toy spaniels I need mention, come from
China. They should have soft fluffy coats, tails inclined to turn over the
back, short faces, broad muzzles, large lustrous eyes, and a grave,
dignified expression. The colour is usually some shade of tawny fawn or
drab, but I have seen them black and dark brown; whatever colour, it should
be without white. The illustration, Mrs. Lindsay's "Tartan Plaid," was one
of the early importations.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

BLENHEIM AND PRINCE CHARLES SPANIELS.

This little group will serve to show the appearance of these charming
little pets.]

ITALIAN GREYHOUNDS, another old-fashioned variety of toy dog, should not
exceed 12 lbs. in weight, but in my opinion are better if they are some
pounds less. Much like miniature greyhounds in shape and build, they are
elegant, graceful little creatures, very sensitive to cold. Shades of fawn,
cream, or French grey are most common; but some are slate-blue,
chestnut-red, and other tints. Of late years the breed has met with more
encouragement, and there is less fear of its being allowed to die out.

GRIFFONS BRUSSELOIS have been greatly taken up the last few years. They are
something like Yorkshire toy terriers in size and shape, but with a
shortish harsh coat, generally of some shade of reddish brown, very short
face, small shining dark eyes, heavy under-jaw, short thick body, and an
altogether comical appearance. Imported specimens, particularly before
reaching maturity, are often difficult to rear.

The AFRICAN SAND-DOG occasionally seen in this country (mostly at shows) is
remarkable for being entirely hairless, except a few hairs of a bristly
character on the top of the head and a slight tuft at the end of the tail;
it is chiefly blue-black or mottled in colour, something in shape and size
like a coarse black-and-tan terrier, and very susceptible to cold.

Having been supplied with an illustration of PARIAH PUPPIES, I will say a
few words about this variety, which is seen in large numbers at
Constantinople and other Eastern cities, where they roam about unclaimed,
and act as amateur scavengers; they are said to divide the places they
inhabit into districts or beats, each with its own leader, and resent any
interference with their authority. I have known cases where they have made
a determined attack on travellers out late at night; but they are rather a
cowardly race, and easily repulsed with a little firmness on the part of
the attacked. Probably these are the descendants of the dogs so often
mentioned in Scripture with opprobrium; and, among Eastern peoples, to call
a man "a dog" is even now the most insulting epithet that can be used. By
the Jews, in ancient times, the dog never seems to have been used, as with
us, in hunting and pursuing game and wild animals, but merely as a guardian
of their flocks, herds, and sometimes dwellings.

CHAPTER VI.

_THE BEARS._

Except the great cats, no creatures have longer held a place in human
interest than the BEARS. Their size and formidable equipment of claws and
teeth give the touch of fear which goes with admiration. On the other hand,
they do not, as a rule, molest human beings, who see them employing their
great strength on apparently insignificant objects with some amusement.
Except one species, most bears are largely fruit and vegetable feeders. The
sloth-bear of India sucks up ants and grubs with its funnel-like lips; the
Malayan bear is a honey-eater by profession, scarcely touching other food
when it can get the bees' store; and only the great polar bear is entirely
carnivorous. The grizzly bear of the Northern Rocky Mountains is largely a
flesh-eater, consuming great quantities of putrid salmon in the Columbian
rivers. But the ice-bear is ever on the quest for living or dead flesh; it
catches seals, devours young sea-fowl and eggs, and can actually kill and
eat the gigantic walrus.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz, Berlin._

AN INVITING ATTITUDE.

The upright position is not natural to the brown bear. It prefers to sit on
its hams, and not to stand.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Fratelli Alinari_]     [_Florence._

THREE PERFORMING BEARS.

Those on the right and left are Himalayan black bears. The white collar is
plainly seen.]

Every one will have noticed the deliberate flat-footed walk of the bears.
This is due partly to the formation of the feet themselves. The whole sole
is set flat upon the ground, and the impressions in a bear's track are not
unlike those of a man's footsteps. The claws are not capable of being
retracted, like those of the Cats; consequently they are worn at the tips
where the curve brings them in contact with the ground. Yet it is
surprising what wounds these blunt but hard weapons will inflict on
man--wounds resembling what might be caused by the use of a very large
garden-rake. Against other animals protected by hair bears' claws are of
little use. Dogs would never attack them so readily as they do were they
armed with the talons of a leopard or tiger. The flesh-teeth in both jaws
of the bear are unlike those of other carnivora. The teeth generally show
that bears have a mixed diet. Bears appear to have descended from some
dog-like ancestor, but to have been much modified.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

EUROPEAN BROWN BEAR.

The specimen of the brown bear of Europe from which this picture was taken
was an unusually light and active bear. Its flanks are almost flat.]

Except the ice-bear, all the species are short and very bulky. It is said
that a polar bear has been killed which weighed 1,000 lbs. It is far the
largest, and most formidable in some respects, of all the Carnivora. The
claws of the grizzly bear are sometimes 5 inches long over the outer curve.
All bears can sit upright on their hams, and stand upright against a
support like a tree. Some can stand upright with no aid at all. Except the
grizzly bear, they can all climb, many of them very well. In the winter, if
it be cold, they hibernate. In the spring, when the shoots of the early
plants come up, they emerge, hungry and thin, to seek their food. Bears
were formerly common in Britain, and were exported for the Roman
amphitheatres. The prehistoric cave-bears were very large. Their remains
have been found in Devon, Derbyshire, and other counties. The species
inhabiting Britain during the Roman period was the common brown bear of
Europe.


THE COMMON BROWN BEAR.

Only one species of bear is found in Europe south of the ice-line, though
above it the white ice-bear inhabits Spitzbergen and the islands off the
White Sea. This is the BROWN BEAR, the emblem of Russia in all European
caricature, and the hero of innumerable fragments of folklore and fable,
from the tents of the Lapps to the nurseries of English children. Except
the ice-bear, it is far the largest of European carnivora, but varies much
in size. Russia is the main home of the brown bear, but it is found in
Sweden and Norway, and right across Northern Asia. It is also common in the
Carpathian Mountains, in the Caucasus, and in Mount Pindus in Greece. In
the south it is found in Spain and the Pyrenees, and a few are left in the
Alps. The dancing-bears commonly brought to England are caught in the
Pyrenees. The "Queen's bear," so called because its owner was allowed to
exhibit it at Windsor, was one of these. But lately dancing-bears from
Servia and Wallachia have also been seen about our roads and streets. In
Russia the bear grows to a great size. Some have been killed of 800 lbs. in
weight. The fur is magnificent in winter, and in great demand for rich
Russians' sledge-rugs. The finest bear-skins of all are bought for the caps
of our own Grenadier and Coldstream Guards. In the Alps the bears
occasionally visit a cow-shed in winter and kill a cow; but as a rule the
only damage done by those in Europe is to the sheep on the hills in the far
north of Norway. Tame brown bears are amusing creatures, but should never
be trusted. They are always liable to turn savage, and the bite is almost
as severe as that of a tiger. Men have had their heads completely crushed
in by the bite of one of these animals. In Russia bears are shot in the
following manner. When the snow falls, the bears retire into the densest
thickets, and there make a half-hut, half-burrow in the most tangled part
to hibernate in. The bear is tracked, and then a ring made round the cover
by beaters and peasants. The shooters follow the track and rouse the bear,
which often charges them, and is forthwith shot. If it escapes, it is
driven in by the beaters outside. High fees are paid to peasants who send
information that a bear is harboured in this way. Sportsmen in St.
Petersburg will go 300 or 400 miles to shoot one on receipt of a telegram.

The brown bear, like the reindeer and red deer, is found very little
modified all across Northern Asia, and again in the forests of North
America. There, however, it undergoes a change. Just as the red deer is
found represented by a much larger creature, the wapiti, so the brown bear
is found exaggerated into the great bear of Alaska. The species attains its
largest, possibly, in Kamchatka, on the Asiatic side of Bering Sea; but the
Alaskan bear has the credit with sportsmen of being the largest. A skin of
one of the former, brought to the sale-rooms of Sir Charles Lampson & Co.,
needed two men to carry it. Last spring, in the sale-rooms of the same
great firm, some persons present measured the skin of an Alaskan bear which
was 9 feet across the shoulders from paw to paw.

LARGE RUSSIAN BROWN BEAR.

The picture shows to what a size and strength the brown bear attains.]


THE GRIZZLY BEAR.

This is a very distinct race of brown bear. It has a flat profile, like the
polar bear; in addition it grows to a great size, is barely able to climb
trees, and has the largest claws of any--they have been known to measure 5
inches along the curve. The true grizzly, which used to be found as far
north as 61° latitude and south as far as Mexico, is a rare animal now. Its
turn for cattle-killing made the ranchmen poison it, and rendered the task
an easy one. It is now only found in the Northern Rocky Mountains, and
perhaps in North California and Nevada. Formerly encounters with "Old
Ephraim," as the trappers called this bear, were numerous and deadly. It
attacked men if attacked by them, and often without provocation. The horse,
perhaps more than its rider, was the object of the bear. Lewis and Clarke
measured a grizzly which was 9 feet long from nose to tail. The weight
sometimes reaches 800 lbs. Measurements of much larger grizzly bears have
been recorded, but it is difficult to credit them. On a ranche near the
upper waters of the Colorado River several colts were taken by grizzly
bears. One of them was found buried according to the custom of this bear,
and the owner sat up to shoot the animal. Having only the old-fashioned
small-bored rifle of the day, excellent for shooting deer or Indians, but
useless against so massive a beast as this bear, unless hit in the head or
heart, he only wounded it. The bear rushed in, struck him a blow with its
paw (the paw measures a foot across), smashed the rifle which he held up as
a protection, and struck the barrel on to his head. The man fell
insensible, when the bear, having satisfied himself that he was dead,
picked him up, carried him off, and buried him in another hole which it
scratched near the dead colt. It then dug up the colt and ate part of it,
and went off. Some time later the man came to his senses, and awoke to find
himself "dead and buried." As the earth was only roughly thrown over him,
he scrambled out, and saw close by the half-eaten remains of the colt.
Thinking that it might be about the bear's dinner-time, and remembering
that he was probably put by in the larder for the next meal, he hurried
home at once, and did not trouble the bear again. Not so a Siberian
peasant, who had much the same adventure. He had been laughed at for
wishing to shoot a bear, and went out into the woods to do so. The bear had
the best of it, knocked him down, and so frightfully mangled his arm that
he fainted. Bruin then buried him in orthodox bear fashion; and the man,
when he came to, which he fortunately did before the bear came back, got
up, and made his way to the village. There he was for a long time ill, and
all through his sickness and delirium talked of nothing but shooting the
bear. When he got well, he disappeared into the forest with his gun, and
after a short absence returned with the bear's skin!

AMERICAN BLACK BEAR.

The black bear was the species first encountered by the early settlers on
the Atlantic side of America. The grizzly belongs to the Rocky Mountain
region.]


THE AMERICAN BROWN BEAR.

The brown bear of America is closely allied to that of Europe; it was first
described by Sir John Richardson, who called it the Barrenlands Bear, and
noted, quite rightly, that it differed from the grizzly in the smallness of
its claws. The difference in the profile is very marked--the brown bear
having a profile like that of the European bear, while that of the grizzly
is flat. The brown bear of North America lives largely on the fruits and
berries of the northern plants, on dead deer, and on putrid fish, of which
quantities are left on the banks of the northern rivers. Whether the large
brown bear of the Rocky Mountains is always a grizzly or often this less
formidable race is doubtful. The writer inclines to think that it is only
the counterpart of the North European and the North Asiatic brown bear. The
following is Sir Samuel Baker's account of these bears. He says: "When I
was in California, experienced informants told me that no true grizzly bear
was to be found east of the Pacific slope, and that Lord Coke was the only
Britisher who had ever killed a real grizzly in California. There are
numerous bears of three if not four kinds in the Rocky Mountains. These are
frequently termed grizzlies; but it is a misnomer. The true grizzly is far
superior in size, but of similar habits, and its weight is from 1,200 lbs.
to 1,400 lbs." After giving various reasons for believing this to be a fair
weight, Sir Samuel Baker adds that this weight is equivalent to that of an
English cart-horse. There are certainly three Rocky Mountain bears--the
Grizzly, the Brown, and the small Black Bear. There is probably also
another--a cross between the black and the brown. It is ridiculous to say
that the brown bears which come to eat the refuse on the dust-heaps of the
hotels in the Yellowstone Park, and let ladies photograph them, are savage
grizzly bears.

YOUNG SYRIAN BEAR FROM THE CAUCASUS.

This is, properly speaking, a Syrian bear, but the species is found in the
Caucasus and in the Taurus Range.]


THE SYRIAN BEAR.

This bear, which figures in the story of Elisha, is a variety of the brown
bear. It is found from the Caucasus to the mountains of Palestine, and is a
smaller animal than the true brown bear, weighing about 300 lbs. The fur in
summer is of a mixed rusty colour, with a whitish collar on the chest. It
steals the grapes on Mount Horeb, and feeds upon ripe fruits, apples,
chestnuts, corn, and the like. It is then ready to face the long winter
sleep.


THE AMERICAN BLACK BEAR.

This is the smallest North American species, and perhaps the most harmless.
It seldom weighs more than 400 lbs. Its coat is short and glossy, and its
flesh, especially in autumn, is esteemed for food. The early backwoodsmen
found it a troublesome neighbour. The bears liked Indian corn, and were not
averse to a young pig. "Like the deer," says Audubon, "it changes its
haunts with the seasons, and for the same reason--viz. the desire of
obtaining food. During the spring months it searches for food in the low
alluvial lands that border the rivers, or by the margins of the inland
lakes. There it procures abundance of succulent roots, and of the tender,
juicy stems of plants, upon which it chiefly feeds at that season. During
the summer heat it enters the gloomy swamps, and passes much of its time in
wallowing in the mud like a hog, and contents itself with crayfish, roots,
and nettles; now and then, when hard pressed by hunger, it seizes a young
pig, or perhaps a sow or calf. As soon as the different kinds of berries
ripen, the bears betake themselves to the high grounds, followed by their
cubs. In much-retired parts of the country, where there are no hilly
grounds, it pays visits to the maize-fields, which it ravages for a while.
After this the various kinds of nuts and grapes, acorns and other forest
fruits, attract its attention. The black bear is then seen wandering
through the woods to gather this harvest, not forgetting to rob every tree
which it comes across."


THE INDIAN SLOTH-BEAR.

Few people would believe that this awkward and ugly beast is so formidable
as it is. It is the commonest Indian species, seldom eats flesh, prefers
sucking up the contents of a white ants' nest to any other meal, and is not
very large; from 200 lbs. to 300 lbs. is the weight of a male. But the
skull and jaws are very strong, and the claws long and curved. As they are
used almost like a pickaxe when the bear wishes to dig in the hardest soil,
their effect upon the human body can be imagined.

Sir Samuel Baker says that there are more accidents to natives of India and
Ceylon from this species than from any other animal.

A BROWN BEAR IN SEARCH OF INSECTS.

The photograph shows a bear feeding on insects, possibly large ants, which
he licks up from the ground, after scratching them out with his claws.]

Mr. Watts Jones writes an interesting account of his sensations while being
bitten by one of these bears: "I was following up a bear which I had
wounded, and rashly went to the mouth of a cave to which it had got. It
charged. I shot, but failed to stop it. I do not know exactly what happened
next, neither does my hunter who was with me; but I believe, from the marks
in the snow, that in his rush the bear knocked me over backwards--in fact,
knocked me three or four feet away. When next I remember anything, the
bear's weight was on me, and he was biting my leg. He bit, two or three
times. I felt the flesh crush, but I felt no pain at all. It was rather
like having a tooth out with gas. I felt no particular terror, though I
thought the bear had got me; but in a hazy sort of way I wondered when he
would kill me, and thought what a fool I was to get killed by a stupid
beast like a bear. The shikari then very pluckily came up and fired a shot
into the bear, and he left me. I felt the weight lift off me, and got up. I
did not think I was much hurt.... The main wound was a flap of flesh torn
out of the inside of my left thigh and left hanging. It was fairly deep,
and I could see all the muscles working underneath when I lifted it up to
clean the wound." This anecdote was sent to Mr. J. Crowther Hirst to
illustrate a theory of his, that the killing of wild animals by other
animals is not a painful one.

Rustem Pasha, once Turkish Ambassador in England, had an accident when
brown bear shooting in Russia, and writes of it in the same sense: "When I
met the accident alluded to, the bear injured both my hands, but did not
tear off part of the arm or shoulder. In the moment of desperate struggle,
the intense excitement and anger did, in fact, render me insensible to the
feeling of actual pain as the bear gnawed my left hand, which was badly
torn and perforated with holes, most of the bones being broken."

There is good reason to believe that when large carnivora, or beasts large
in proportion to the size of their victims, strike and kill them with a
great previous shock, the sense of pain is deadened. Not so if the person
or animal is seized quietly. Then the pain is intense, though sometimes
only momentary. A tigress seized Mr. J. Hansard, a forest officer in
Ceylon, by the neck. In describing his sensations afterwards, he said: "The
agony I felt was something frightful. My whole skull seemed as if it were
being crushed to atoms in the jaws of the great brute. I certainly felt the
most awful pain as she was biting my neck; but not afterwards, if I can
remember." Sir Samuel Baker says he has twice seen the sloth-bear attack a
howdah-elephant. Lord Edward St. Maur, son of the Duke of Somerset, was
killed by one. Mr. Sanderson, the head of the Government Elephant-catching
Department, used to hunt bears in the jungle with bull-terriers. Against
these the bear was unable to make a good fight. They seized it by the nose;
and as its claws were not sharp like those of the leopard, the bear could
not get them off.

This bear seldom produces more than two or three young at a birth. The
young cub is very ugly, but very strong, especially in the claws and legs.
A six weeks' old cub has been turned upside-down in a basket, which was
shaken violently, without dislodging the little animal clinging inside.

POLAR BEARS.

Though Arctic animals, polar bears can endure great heat. During a "heat
wave" at Hamburg, Herr C. Hagenbeck found two of his leopards suffering
from heat apoplexy, but the polar bears were enjoying the sun.]


THE ISABELLINE BEAR AND HIMALAYAN BLACK BEAR.

The former animal is a medium-sized variety of the brown bear. The coat in
winter is of a beautiful silver-tipped cinnamon colour. The HIMALAYAN BLACK
BEAR has a half-moon of white on its throat. The habits of both do not
differ markedly from those of the brown bear of Europe.

Recently black bears have been most troublesome in Kashmir, attacking and
killing and wounding the woodcutters with no provocation. Dr. E. T. Vere,
writing from Srinagar, says: "Every year we have about half a dozen
patients who have been mauled by bears. Most of our people who are hurt are
villagers or shepherds. Bears have been so shot at in Kashmir that,
although not naturally very fierce, they have become truculent. When they
attack men, they usually sit up and knock the victim over with a paw. They
then make one or two bites at the arm or leg, and often finish up with a
snap at the head. This is the most dangerous part of the attack. One of our
fatal cases this year was a boy, the vault of whose skull was torn off and
lacerated. Another man received a compound fracture of the cranium. A third
had the bones of his face smashed and lacerated. He had an axe, but said,
'When the bear sat up, my courage failed me.'"

[Illustration: _Photo by Fratelli Alinari_]     [_Florence._

TWO POLAR BEARS AND A BROWN BEAR.

Although this is a photograph from life, it is scarcely a very natural
scene; as a matter of fact, all three animals belong to Herr Carl
Hagenbeck's remarkable menagerie.]


THE MALAYAN SUN-BEAR.

These small, smooth-coated bears have a yellow throat-patch like a mustard
plaster, and are altogether the most amusing and comical of all the tribe.
They are almost as smooth as a pointer dog, and are devoted to all sweet
substances which can be a substitute for honey, their main delicacy when
wild. There are always a number of these bears at the Zoo incessantly
begging for food. When one gets a piece of sugar, he cracks it into small
pieces, sticks them on the back of his paw, and licks the mess until the
paw is covered with sticky syrup, which he eats with great gusto. This bear
is found in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java. It is only 4
feet high, or sometimes half a foot taller. It is more in the habit of
walking upright than any other species.


THE POLAR BEAR.

ICE-BEAR is the better name for this, the most interesting in its habits of
all the bears. It is an inhabitant of the lands of polar darkness and
intense cold, and one of the very few land animals which never try to avoid
the terrible ordeal of the long Arctic night, which rolls on from month to
month. It can swim and dive nearly as well as a seal, climbs the icebergs,
and goes voyages on the drifting ice, floating hundreds of miles on the
polar currents, and feeding on the seals which surround it. Of the limits
of size of the ice-bear it is impossible to speak with certainty. From the
skins brought to this country the size of some of them must be enormous.
One which lived for more than thirty years at the Zoo was of immense length
and bulk. When the first discoverers went to the Arctic Seas, dressed in
thick clothes and skins, the polar bears took them for seals. On Bear
Island, below Spitzbergen, a Dutch sailor sat down on the snow to rest. A
bear walked up behind him, and seized and crushed his head, evidently not
in the least aware of what kind of animal it had got hold of. When the
Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition was wintering in Franz-Josef Land, the bears
were a positive nuisance. They were not afraid of man, and used to come
round the huts at all hours. The men shot so many that they formed a
valuable article of food for the dogs. The flesh is said to be unwholesome
for men. The power of these bears in the water is wonderful; though so
bulky, they are as light as a cork when swimming, and their strong, broad
feet are first-class paddles. Whenever a dead whale is found near the
shore, the polar bears assemble to feed upon it. In the various searches
for the Franklin Expedition they pulled to pieces nearly all the cabins
erected to hold provisions for the sledge-parties. In one case it was found
that the bears had amused themselves by mounting the roof of a half-buried
hut, and sliding down the snowy, frozen slope. Cubs are often brought home
in whaling- and sealing-ships, after the mothers have been shot. There is a
ready sale of them for Continental menageries. Herr Hagenbeck, of Hamburg,
by purchasing them quite young, has induced bears to live on good terms
with tigers, boar-hounds, and leopards.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

POLAR BEAR.

This bear is the most formidable of all aquatic mammals. It is almost as
much at home in the water as a seal.]

The manoeuvres of an ice-bear in the water are marvellous to watch. Though
so bulky a beast, it swims, dives, rolls over and over, catches seals or
fish, or plays both on and under the water with an ease and evident
enjoyment which show that it is in its favourite element. One favourite
game of the ice-bear is to lie on its back in the water, and then to catch
hold of its hind toes with its fore feet, when it resembles a half-rolled
hedgehog of gigantic size. It then rolls over and over in the water like a
revolving cask. Its footsteps are absolutely noiseless, as the claws are
shorter than in the land-bear's, and more muffled in fur. This noiseless
power of approach is very necessary when it has to catch such wary
creatures as basking seals. A very large proportion of the food formerly
eaten by ice-bears in summer was probably putrid, as they were always
supplied with a quantity of the refuse carcases of whales and seals left by
the whaling-ships. This may account for the bad results to the sailors who
ate the bears' flesh. Now the whaling industry is so little pursued that
the bears have to catch their dinners for themselves, and eat fresh food.

[Illustration: _Photo by the New York Zoological Society._

HALF-GROWN POLAR BEARS.

When young polar bears are brought to England or New York on board ship,
they arrive with coats almost as yellow as a sponge. It takes a week's
bathing to restore the pure white colour.]

The Arctic explorer Nordenskiöld saw much of the ice-bears on his voyages,
and left us what is perhaps the best description of their attempts to stalk
men, mistaking them for other animals. "When the polar bear observes a
man," he writes in his "Voyage of the Vega," "he commonly approaches him as
a possible prey, with supple movements and a hundred zigzag bends, in order
to conceal the direction he means to take, and to prevent the man feeling
frightened. During his approach he often climbs up on to blocks of ice, or
raises himself on his hind legs, in order to get a more extensive view. If
he thinks he has to do with a seal, he creeps or trails himself forward on
the ice, and is then said to conceal with his fore paws the only part of
his body that contrasts with the white colour of the snow--his large black
nose. If the man keeps quite still, the bear comes in this way so near that
it can be shot at the distance of two gun-lengths, or killed with a lance,
which the hunters consider safer."

When a vessel lies at anchor, a polar bear sometimes swims out to it, to
inspect the visiting ship; it has also a special fancy for breaking open
and searching stores of provisions, boats abandoned and covered over, and
cabins of wrecked ships. One bear which had looted a provision depôt was
found to have swallowed a quantity of sticking-plaster. The ice-bear has
been met swimming at a distance of eighty miles from land, and with no ice
in sight. This shows how thoroughly aquatic its habits and powers are.
Polar bears do not hug their victims, like the brown bear, but bite, and
use their immense feet and sharp claws. It has been said that when one
catches a seal on the ice it will play with it as a cat does with a mouse.
The size of these bears varies very much. Seven or eight feet from the tip
of the nose to the tail is the usual length; yet they have been known to
exceed even 13 feet in length. This would correspond to an immense
difference in bulk and weight. An ice-bear was once found feeding on the
body of a white whale, 15 feet in length, and weighing three or four tons.
The whale could not have got on to the ice by itself, and it is difficult
to imagine that any other creature except the bear could have dragged it
there from the sea, where it was found floating. When hunting seals, polar
bears will chase them in the water as an otter does a fish, but with what
result is not known. Besides stalking them in the manner described above,
they will mark the place at which seals are basking on the rim of an
ice-floe, and then dive, and come up just at the spot where the seal would
naturally drop into the water. Those shot for the sake of their skins are
nearly all killed when swimming in the sea. The hunters mark a bear on an
ice-floe, and approach it. The bear always tries to escape by swimming, and
is pursued and shot through the head from the boat. When the females have a
cub or cubs with them, they will often attack persons or boats which molest
them; otherwise they do not willingly interfere with man, except, as has
been said above, when they mistake men for seals or other natural prey.

[Illustration: _Photo by G. W. Wilson & Co., Ltd._]     [_Aberdeen._

THE ICE-BEAR'S COUCH.

A favourite attitude of the polar bear is to lie stretched on its stomach,
with the hind and fore legs extended flat. The head often lies between the
fore paws. Notice the hair on the feet, which keeps the animal from
slipping when on the ice.]

The instances recorded of the affection shown by these animals for their
young are somewhat pathetic. When the _Carcase_ frigate, which was engaged
on a voyage of Arctic discovery, was locked in the ice, a she-bear and two
cubs made their way to the ship, attracted by the scent of the blubber of a
walrus which the crew had killed a few days before. They ran to the fire,
and pulled off some of the walrus-flesh which remained unconsumed. The crew
then threw them large lumps of the flesh which were lying on the ice, which
the old bear fetched away singly, and laid before her cubs as she brought
it, dividing it, and giving each a share, and reserving but a small portion
for herself. As she was fetching away the last piece, the sailors shot both
the cubs dead, and wounded the dam. Although she could only just crawl to
the place where the cubs lay, she carried the lump of flesh which she had
last fetched away, and laid it before them; and when she saw that they
refused to eat, laid her paws on them, and tried to raise them up, moaning
pitifully. When she found she could not stir them, she went to some
distance, and looked back, and then returned, pawing them all over and
moaning. Finding at last that they were lifeless, she raised her head
towards the ship and uttered a growl, when the sailors killed her with a
volley of musket-balls.

_THE SMALLER CARNIVORA._

----

THE RACCOON FAMILY.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

COMMON RACCOON.

This is the typical representative of the Raccoon Family. It is found in
most parts of the United States, and also in South America.]

A link between the Bears and the Weasel Tribe is made by the RACCOONS and
their allies. They are bear-like in having a short, thick body, and in
their flat-footed manner of walking; also in their habit of sitting up on
end, and using their paws as hands, to some extent, in aiding them to
climb. But they are also much like the Civets; and the pretty little
CACOMIXLE, or RING-TAILED CAT of Mexico, was formerly classed with the
civets. They are all very active, enterprising, and quick-witted creatures
of no great size, very different in temperament from the bears.


THE RACCOON.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

RACCOON.

This animal has the habit of always washing its food, if possible, before
it eats it.]

The type of the family is the AMERICAN RACCOON itself. Its scientific name
of "Letor," the "Washer," was given to it from an odd habit these creatures
have of wetting and washing their food in any water which is near. One kept
at the Zoo washed her kittens so much when they were born that they all
died.

The 'coon inhabits America from Canada to the south as far down as
Paraguay. In size it is equal to a common fox, but is short and stout.
Restless, inquisitive, and prying, it is a most mischievous beast where
farmyards and poultry are within reach. It kills the fowls, eats the eggs,
samples the fruit, and if caught shams dead with all the doggedness of an
opossum. It is very fond of fish and shell-fish. Oysters are a special
dainty, as are mussels and clams. A gentleman who kept one says: "It opens
oysters with wonderful skill. It is sufficient for it to break the hinge
with its teeth; its paws complete the work of getting out the oyster. It
must have a delicate sense of touch. In this operation it rarely avails
itself of sight or smell. It passes the oyster under its hind paws; then,
without looking, it seeks with its hands the weakest place. It there digs
in its claws, forces asunder the valves, and tears out the flesh in
fragments, leaving nothing behind." Its favourite haunt is in the
cane-brakes of the south. There the planters follow it by night with dogs,
and shoot it in the trees in which it takes refuge. The skins, with
handsome alternations of yellow and brown, make fine carriage-rugs.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

GREAT PANDA.

This very rare animal is found on the high plateau of Tibet.]


THE COATIS.

The COATIS are small arboreal creatures, with the habits of a raccoon and
squirrel fairly proportioned. They are flesh-eaters, but active and
playful. Their long pig-like snouts give them an unpleasant appearance.
They inhabit Mexico and Central and South America as far as Paraguay.
Several specimens are generally to be seen at the Zoological Gardens. Their
habits are much the same as those of the small tree-climbing cats, but with
something of the badger added. Insects and worms, as well as birds and
small animals, form their food.


THE PANDAS AND KINKAJOU.

Among the small carnivorous mammals the BEAR-CAT, or PANDA, is a very
interesting creature. Its colour is striking--a beautiful red-chestnut
above, the lower surface jet-black, the tail long and ringed. The quality
of the fur is fine also. It is found in the Eastern Himalaya, and is as
large as a badger. The GREAT PANDA, from Eastern Tibet, is a much larger,
short-tailed, black-and-white animal, once thought to be a bear. The
KINKAJOU has a prehensile tail, and uses its paws as hands so readily that
it was formerly placed among the lemurs. It is a native of Southern and
intertropical America. Nocturnal, and living in the great forests, it is
seldom seen by man. Its head is round and cat-like, its feet are the same,
but with non-retractile claws, and it has a long, full tail. It has a long
tongue, with which it can lick out insects from the crevices and holes of
trees. Baron von Humboldt says that it attacks the nests of wild bees. It
uses its tongue to draw objects of food towards it, even if they are not
living. A pleasant description of this animal appeared in Charles Knight's
"Museum of Animated Nature," published many years ago: "In its aspect there
is something of gentleness and good-nature. In captivity it is extremely
playful, familiar, and fond of being noticed. One lived in the gardens of
the Zoological Society for seven years. During the greater part of the
morning it was asleep, rolled up in a ball in its cage. In the afternoon it
would come out, traverse its cage, take food, and play with those to whom
it was accustomed. Clinging to the top wires of its cage with its tail and
hind paws, it would thus swing itself backwards and forwards. When thus
hanging, it would bring its fore paws to the bars, as well as the hind
pair, and in this manner would travel up and down its cage with the utmost
address, every now and then thrusting out its long tongue between the
wires, as if in quest of food, which, when offered to it, it would
endeavour to draw in between the wires with this organ. It was very fond of
being gently stroked and scratched, and when at play with any one it knew
it would pretend to bite, seizing the hand or fingers with its teeth, as a
dog will do when playing with its master. As the evening came on, it was
full of animation, and exhibited in every movement the most surprising
energy."

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo, Co., Parson's Green._

KINKAJOU.

The kinkajou eats birds and eggs as well as honey and fruit. One kept in
South America killed a whole brood of turkeys, and was partial to birds'
eggs.]


THE OTTERS.

As the badgers and ratels seem specially adapted to an underground and
cave-making existence, so the Otters all conform in structure to an aquatic
life; yet, except the webbing of the space between the toes and the
shortening and flattening of the head, there is very little obvious change
in their structure to meet the very great difference in the conditions
under which they live.

The SHORT-TOED OTTER is a small Indian species. It has nails on its hands
in place of claws. One kept at the Zoo was a most amusing and friendly
little pet, which let itself be nursed like a kitten.

The NORTH AMERICAN OTTER has the same habits as the English kind, but is
somewhat larger, and has a far finer coat. It is trapped in thousands, and
the fur sent over to this country to the Hudson Bay Company's and Sir
Charles Lampson's fur-sales. These otters, like all their family, are very
fond of playing. One of their regular games is to make a snow-slide or an
ice-slide down a frozen waterfall. The alighting-place from this chute is,
if possible, in the water. There the trapper sets his traps, and the poor
otters are caught.

[Illustration: _By permission of Percy Leigh Pemberton, Esq._

YOUNG OTTERS.

Otters, when taken young, can be trained to catch fish for their owners. In
India several tribes employ them for this purpose.]

The COMMON OTTER is far the most attractive of the British carnivora. It is
still fairly common all over Britain where fish exist. It is found on the
Norfolk broads and rivers, all up the Thames, in Scotland, Devonshire,
Wales, Cumberland, and Northumberland. It travels considerable distances
from river to river, and sometimes gets into a preserved trout-pool or
breeding-pond, and does much mischief. The beautiful young otters here
figured are in Mr. Percy Leigh Pemberton's collection of British mammals at
Ashford, Kent. Their owner made a large brick tank for them, where they
were allowed to catch live fish. Once one of them seized a 4-lb. pike by
the tail. The pike wriggled round and seized the otter's paw, but was soon
placed _hors de combat_. The largest otter which the writer has seen was
bolted by a ferret from a rabbit-warren on the edge of the Norfolk fen at
Hockwold, and shot by the keeper, who was rabbiting.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

TWO TAME OTTERS.

These two little otters were photographed by the Duchess of Bedford.
Alluding to the old signs of the zodiac and their fondness for the
watering-pot, their portrait was called "Aquarius" and "The Twins."]

English dog otters sometimes weigh as much as 26 lbs. They regularly hunt
down the rivers by night, returning before morning to their holt, where
they sleep by day. No fish stands a chance with them. They swim after the
fish in the open river, chase it under the bank, and then corner it, or
seize it with a rush, just as the penguins catch gudgeon at the Zoo.
Captain Salvin owned a famous tame otter which used to go for walks with
him, and amuse itself by catching fish in the roadside ponds.


THE SEA-OTTER.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

SEA-OTTER.

The sea-otter has the most valuable fur of any animal.]

Common otters killed on the coast are often confounded with the SEA-OTTER.
This is a great mistake. The sea-otter is as much a marine animal as the
seal or the sea-lion. It swims out in the open ocean, and is even more of a
pelagic creature than the seal, for it either produces its young when in
the water, or at any rate carries and suckles them on the open sea. The
sea-otter is much larger than the common otter. Unfortunately the fish and
other marine creatures which form the food of the sea-otters are found
mainly near the coast. Following them, the otters come near the Aleutian
Islands, where the hunters are ever on the watch for them. If a single
otter is seen, five or six boats, with a rifleman in each, at once put out,
and the otter stands little chance of escape. It never was a common animal,
and the prices given for the fur, up to £200 for a first-class skin, have
caused its destruction. The skin, when stretched and cured, is sometimes 5
feet long, and is of an exquisite natural rich brown, like long plush,
sprinkled all over with whitish hairs like hoarfrost.

RACCOON.

This animal is found from Alaska, through the United States, to Central
America.]

THE SKUNKS.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

A SKUNK.

An American animal, noted chiefly for the scent-gland it possesses, from
which it emits a most obnoxious-smelling fluid.]

Of all the strange equipments given by nature to animals for their
protection that possessed by the various species of SKUNK is the most
effective. These animals are able to emit a fluid so vile in odour that it
seems equally hateful to all animals. Dogs, pumas, men, alike shun them,
and the animals seem to know this and to presume on their immunity. An
ordinary skunk is about the size of a cat, black, with bright white stripes
down the sides and back. The fur is thick and handsome, and, if the animal
be killed before it discharges its fluid, is not too strongly odorous to
make trimmings for jackets. Mr. Hudson, in his "Naturalist in La Plata,"
says: "In talking to strangers from abroad, I have never thought it
necessary to speak of the dangers of sunstroke, jaguars, or the assassin's
knife. But I have never omitted to warn them of the skunk, minutely
describing its habits and personal appearance. I knew an Englishman who, on
taking a first gallop across the Pampas, saw one, and, quickly dismounting,
hurled himself bodily on to it to effect its capture. Poor man! He did not
know that the animal is never unwilling to be caught. Men have been blinded
by them for ever by a discharge of the fiery liquid in their faces. The
smell pervades the whole system of any one subjected to it, like a
pestilent ether, nauseating the victim till sea-sickness seems pleasant in
comparison." Dogs can be taught to kill skunks; but they show the greatest
disgust and horror when the fluid of the animal falls upon them, and
sometimes roll in mud or dust in the endeavour to get rid of it.


THE BADGERS.

The BADGERS include several genera. The SAND-BADGERS of the East have a
naked snout, small ears, and rough fur, with softer fur underneath. The
INDIAN BADGER is larger than that of Europe, while that of Java, Sumatra,
and Borneo is smaller, and has a very short tail.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

A BADGER IN THE WATER.

Badgers are increasing in many parts of England. They are nocturnal
animals.]

The FERRET-BADGERS from the East have elongated bodies and short tails.
They are tree-climbers, and as omnivorous as the badger itself. The CAPE
ZORILLA, with another species found in Egypt, is more nearly allied to the
polecats, but is striped like a skunk.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

EUROPEAN BADGER.

Badgers can be readily kept in confinement, and are not difficult to tame
thoroughly.]

The EUROPEAN BADGER is still fairly numerous. There is not a county in
England where it is not found. A large colony has been established in
Epping Forest, some fifty yards square of hillside being honeycombed with
badger-earths. The European badger is found all over temperate Northern
Europe and Asia; but being shy, wary, and mainly nocturnal, is seldom seen.
At night it wanders about, and in August gets into the corn-fields, whence
it is chased and caught by dogs. A Somersetshire farmer had a pointer and
sheep-dog which were adepts at this night-catching of badgers. They would
accompany their master along the roads, and the pointer instantly winded
any badger which had crossed. Both dogs then bounded off, and soon their
loud barking showed that they had found and "held up" the badger. The dogs'
owner then came up, picked the badger up by its tail, and dropped it in a
sack. The badger's "earth" is wonderfully deep and winding; in it the
badger sleeps during the winter, and gives birth to its young, three or
four of which are produced at a time. The end of March is the period of
birth, but the cubs do not come out until June. In October they are
full-grown. The badger carries in a great quantity of fern and grass as a
bed for its cubs. Mr. Trevor-Battye writes: "I had a pair which were
probably about six weeks old. They were called Gripper and Nancy. They
would rest on my lap when feeding, and sit up and beg like dogs. Their
hearing and power of scent were remarkable. The badgers were in a closed
yard; but if any of the dogs came near, even following a path which ran at
a distance of six or seven yards, they would instantly jump off my lap and
disappear into a corner. The animals could walk and trot _backwards_ with
the greatest ease." I have never seen this noticed elsewhere, yet it is
worth mentioning, because it is characteristic of the Weasel Family, not
being shared, to my knowledge, by any other mammal--not, for instance, by
the Bears.

Mr. A. E. Pease says of the badger: "It is easily domesticated, and if
brought up by hand is found an interesting and charming companion. I had at
one time two that I could do anything with, and which followed me so
closely that they would bump against my boots each step I took, and come
and snuggle in under my coat when I sat down."


THE RATELS.

As the mink is adapted for an aquatic diet, so the RATELS, a link between
the Weasels and the Badgers, seem to have been specialised to live upon
insects and honey as well as flesh. They are quaint creatures, with rounded
iron-grey backs, and black bellies, noses, and feet. The African kind is
found in Cape Colony and East Africa, and is believed to live largely on
honey and bee-brood. The habits of the ratel are almost identical with
those of the badger, except that it is less shy and very restless. A nearly
similar species of ratel is found in Southern Asia from the Caspian to
India.

The ratels are strictly nocturnal, and make their lair by day in hollow
trees, though they are said not to climb. The skin is protected by thick,
close hair, so that bees cannot sting through the fur. The skin is also
very loose. If a dog bites it, the ratel can generally twist round and bite
back. The African ratel is omnivorous. It eats snakes and birds. The body
of a cobra has been found in the stomach of one.


THE WEASEL TRIBE.

No animals are more bloodthirsty and carnivorous than most of the Weasel
Tribe. They are also well equipped both in actual weapons and in activity
of body, and have powers quite out of proportion to their size. They are
also gifted with magnificent coats, and constitute the most valuable source
of choice furs. Sable, Marten, Mink, Wolverine, Ermine, Otters, and several
others are among the most highly prized. Their claws are sharp, but not
retractile. It is indeed fortunate that these creatures are so small in
size, otherwise they would be among the greatest enemies of animal life. As
things are, they are useful in keeping down the numbers of creatures which,
like field-mice, moles, rabbits, and rats, might, and occasionally do,
become a pest.


THE MARTENS.

There are two species of marten in Europe--the BEECH--and the PINE-MARTEN.
The latter has a yellow throat, the former a white one. The fur is almost
as fine as sable. All so-called Canadian sables are really martens. These
animals are found throughout Northern Europe and Northern Asia, in Japan,
and all over Northern America. In Scotland the pine-marten survives in the
pine forests; also in Ireland, where it is occasionally killed on the
Wicklow Mountains, near Dublin, and on the Mourne Mountains. It is believed
to remain in Cumberland, Devonshire, and possibly in parts of Wales. It is
a tree-loving animal, and feeds mainly on squirrels, which it pursues
through the branches. It is also fond of fruit. Mr. Charles St. John
discovered this in a curious way. He noticed that his raspberries were
being stolen, so set a trap among the canes. Next day all he could see was
a heap of newly gathered raspberry leaves where the trap was. Stooping down
to move them, a marten sprang up and tried to defend itself. The poor beast
had come to gather more raspberries, and had been caught. Unable to escape,
it gathered the leaves near and concealed itself.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

RATEL.

Ratels are curiously restless little animals, with a peculiar trot-like
walk.]


THE SABLE.

This is so little different from the marten that some have thought it only
a northern variety. That is not the case, as both are found in the same
area, and no one who knows anything of form and colour could mistake the
true sable's fur. This fur is so fine and even that each single hair tapers
gradually to a point: that is why sable brushes for painting are so
valuable; they always form a point when wet. The price of these brushes,
which are of genuine sable fur, though made up from fragments of the
worst-coloured or damaged skins, varies yearly with the price of sable in
the market.


THE MINK.

Ladies are very familiar with the fur of the MINK, which is one of the best
of the less expensive varieties; it is not glossy as marten or sable, and
of a lighter and more uniform brown. The mink is a water-haunting polecat,
found in Siberia, North America, and Japan. Its main home is in North
America, where the immense system of lakes and rivers gives scope for its
aquatic habits. The under-fur is particularly warm and thick, to keep out
the cold of the water, in which the animal spends more time than on land.
It is not stated to catch fish, as does the otter, in the water; but it
lives on frogs, crayfish, mussels, and dead or stranded fish. Minks have
been kept in confinement and regularly bred in "minkeries," as is the blue
fox, and in Manchuria the chow dog, for the sake of its fur.

[Illustration: _By permission of Percy Leigh Pemberton, Esq._

PINE-MARTEN.

Pine-martens have most beautiful fur, and for that reason are much hunted
in America.]


THE POLECAT.

This is now probably the rarest of the British weasels. It is almost
identically the same as the polecat-ferret, a cross-breed between it and
the domesticated variety. It survives in a few of the great woodlands of
the Midlands and of Oxfordshire, in Scotland, and Wales. It is found in
Cumberland, near Bowness, and on Exmoor and Dartmoor where rabbits abound.
It is an expert swimmer. Its habits are the same as those of the stoat, but
it is slower in its movements. It catches fish, and can pick up food from
the bottom of the water. Wild ones can be trained to work like ferrets.
"They do not delay in the hole, but follow the rat out and catch it in a
couple of bounds" (Trevor-Battye). The FERRET is a domesticated breed of
polecat. It is identical in shape and habits, but unable to stand the cold
of our climate in the open.

[Illustration: _By permission of Percy Leigh Pemberton, Esq._

POLECAT.

In England this animal in becoming very scarce.]


THE WEASEL.

The smallest, fiercest, and commonest of its race, the little WEASEL is by
no means the least formidable to other animals of the carnivora of England.
It is cinnamon-coloured, with a white throat and belly, and climbs as
neatly as a cat, running up vertical boughs with almost greater facility. A
weasel in a high hedge will run the whole length of the fence, from twig to
twig, without descending; it threads the galleries of the field-mice, sucks
the eggs of small birds in their nests, and attacks rats, mice, rabbits,
and even such large birds as grouse without fear or hesitation. During a
great plague of field-voles in the Lowlands of Scotland in the years 1890
and 1891 the weasels increased enormously. A shepherd took the trouble to
follow a weasel down a hollow drain in the vole-infested hillside; he found
the bodies of no less than thirteen field-mice, which the weasel had amused
itself by killing. In winter weasels hunt the corn-stacks for mice, and
often make a home among the sheaves. One was seen chasing a vole by Mr.
Trevor-Battye, who picked up the vole, which the weasel was just about to
jump up for, when he threw it into the hedge. There the weasel pounced on
it and carried it off!

The main food of the weasel is the field-mouse and small voles. Weasels are
very devoted to their young; they will pick them up and carry them off as a
cat does a kitten, if the nest is in danger. Their hunting shows great
marks of cunning. One was seen in a field in which a number of
corn-buntings were flying about, alighting on thistles. The weasel went and
hid under one of the tallest thistles, on which a bunting soon alighted; an
instant after it sprang up and caught and killed the bird.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

HIMALAYAN WEASEL.

Weasels are still common in England. They are fierce, and absolutely
fearless when in pursuit of game.]


THE STOAT, OR ERMINE.

This is the commonest and most widely distributed of all the Weasel Tribe.
In winter the fur turns to pure white in the northern countries, and
occasionally in Southern England. It is then known as the ERMINE, and
yields the ermine fur. In every country where it is found it is the deadly
foe of all small animals, from the hare to the smallest field-mice. It has
the same passion for killing for killing's sake shared by the ferret. If a
stoat finds a rabbit's nest, for instance, it always murders all the young
ones. These creatures sometimes contrive to hunt in packs, or to migrate in
society. They are very fond of their young, which they lay up in old crows'
nests, holes in banks, or straw-stacks. They have often been seen to carry
them out of danger in their mouths. The length of the head and body is 10¾
inches, and of the tail 6½ inches. The young are usually from five to eight
in number, and are born in April or May. They soon move into the long
standing-grass, and remain there till it is cut. After that they move to
the woods and covers, and great numbers are trapped. If not, they attack
the young pheasants, and do great damage. They can climb well, and are
known, as is the polecat, to ascend trees and kill birds on their nests.
They also suck eggs. Forty-two pheasants' eggs were taken by Mr. de Winton
from one stoat's hole.

These photographs show the stoat (or ermine, as it is often called) in its
summer and winter coats. This animal gives us the well-known ermine fur.]


THE GLUTTON, OR WOLVERINE.

This largest and most destructive of all the Weasel Tribe is found all
round the northern edge of the Arctic Circle, from Norway to Hudson Bay. It
is a large heavy animal, with a short head, sharp claws, long thick fur,
and a clumsy gait. Its tusks are very long and sharp; and its appetite, if
not so insatiable as the old travellers were told, is sharp enough to keep
it always hunting. It follows the fur-trappers in the woods, and, being
very cunning, breaks in at the back of their fall-traps, and robs the baits
or the prey caught. When Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle made the North-west
Passage by land, they lost nearly all their furs in this way. Once, having
trapped a valuable silver fox, the only one caught by them, they found
nothing but shreds of fur left by the glutton. As the marten-hunters' line
of traps is perhaps fifty or sixty miles long, the loss and damage caused
by the glutton is most mortifying. This animal can only be caught in steel
traps, and that with great difficulty.

CHAPTER VIII.

_MARINE CARNIVORA: THE SEALS, SEA-LIONS, AND WALRUS._

There are three families of the Sea Carnivora,--the Fur-seals, or Eared
Seals; the Walrus; and the True or Earless Seals.

[Illustration: _Photo by G. W. Wilson & Co., Ltd._]     [_Aberdeen._

STELLER'S SEA-LION.

The eared seal, or sea-lion, has the hind flippers divided, and is thus
able to move with comparative ease on land.]

The first group, which are called EARED SEALS, and occasionally SEA-LIONS
and SEA-BEARS, have a small outer ear, and when on land the hind flippers
are folded forwards beneath the body. There is a distinct neck, and on the
flippers are rudimentary claws. Some of the eared seals have the close and
fine under-fur which makes their capture so remunerative. Under the skin
there is often a thick layer of blubber, which is also turned to commercial
uses by the sealers.

The WALRUS stands by itself. It is a purely Arctic species, whereas
fur-seals are found from Bering Sea to the Antarctic; and forms in some
degree a connecting-link between the eared seals and the true seals. Like
the former, it turns the front flippers forwards and inwards when on land;
but it resembles the true seals in having no external ears. The upper
canine teeth are developed into enormous tusks of hard ivory.

The COMMON SEALS are the most thoroughly aquatic. The hind flippers seem
almost to have coalesced with the tail, and are always directed backwards
in line with it. They have no under-fur. On land they can only use the
front flippers to aid their progress.

Most seals are marine, though some are found in the land-locked sea of Lake
Baikal, in Central Asia, and the true seals often come up rivers.


THE EARED SEALS, OR SEA-LIONS.

These and the walrus have their hind limbs so far free that they can crawl
on land and use their flippers for other purposes than swimming; they can
comb their hair with them, and walk in an awkward way. They are divided
into the fur-seals and hair-seals in the language of trade. The fur-seals
are those from which ladies' seal-skin jackets are made; the hair-seals are
sought for their hides and oil. A demand has sprung up for the latter to
make coats for automobilists to wear when riding at high speed in cold
weather. The "porpoise-hide" boots are really made from the skin of the
hair-seal.

Both hair-seals and fur-seals have in common the remarkable habit of
assembling in large herds during the breeding-season, and of spending a
long period on land after the young are born. The male seals reach the
islands, or "rookeries," first, followed by the females. The latter give
birth to their young almost as soon as they reach the rocks, and are then
seized and gathered into harems by the strongest and oldest males. The
sea-lions of Patagonia, equally with the fur-seals of Bering Sea and the
Pribyloff Islands, never feed during the whole time which they spend on the
rocks, often for a period of two months.

SEA-LION.

This photograph shows the dry mane of the sea-lion, a rather uncommon
sight, as it rarely remains long enough out of the water for its fur to
become absolutely dry.]


THE FUR-SEALS.

The NORTHERN FUR-SEAL is the only member of this group surviving in any
number. These animals still annually resort to the Aleutian Islands, in the
territory of Alaska, in great herds to produce their young, and to certain
other islets off the coast of Japan. This northern fur-seal, from the fur
of which the seal-skin jackets are obtained, is, when full grown, between 6
and 7 feet long. The females are only 4 feet or 4½ feet in length. The
shoulder of the male is grey, the rest of the body varying between reddish
grey and deep black. The female is lighter in colour. Males of this species
are not full grown till six years of age, but breed when four years old.
The females produce young at three years of age. The male seals take
possession of the females almost immediately after reaching the
breeding-grounds, each male collecting as many females as it can round it.
The pups keep with their mothers. This assemblage is surrounded by great
numbers of young male or bachelor seals, which the old males prevent from
annexing any of the females. The greatest of all these gathering-places are
on the Pribyloff Islands and certain other islets in Bering Sea. By the end
of May both male and female seals swim in flocks through Bering Straits,
making for the islands. The islands themselves are leased to American
merchants. But as those seals killed on the way are all just about to bring
forth young, the waste and cruelty of this "pelagic sealing" will be easily
understood. On the islands, or "rookeries," the males, mothers, and pups
remain till August, when the pups take to the water. The male seals have
remained for at least two months, incessantly fighting and watching,
without taking any food. By that time they are quite exhausted, the fat
which they laid up previously being all absorbed. The fur has not naturally
either the colour or texture which art gives it. The outer fur is long and
coarse, and only the inner fur of the exquisite texture of the "made" skin.
The former is removed, and the latter dyed to the rich brown colour which
we see. The fur-seals are steadily diminishing, and each year's catch is
smaller than that of the year before.

The CAPE FUR-SEAL, SOUTHERN FUR-SEAL, and NEW ZEALAND FUR-SEAL are
practically extinct for commercial purposes.


THE HAIR-SEALS.

Among these are the large so-called "sea-lions" of Patagonia and the North
Pacific. We are familiar with their appearance, because for many years
specimens have been kept at the Zoological Gardens. Their habits are much
the same as those of the fur-seals. The principal species are, in the
north, STELLER'S SEA-LION, and the PATAGONIAN SEA-LION in the south. Those
kept at the Zoological Gardens are usually of the latter species.

STELLER'S SEA-LION is already on the road to extinction. When the annual
catch of fur-seals reached 100,000 a year, the total number of these
northern sea-lions was estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. They repair
every year to the Pribyloff Islands to breed, as the fur-seals do, but are
shier and more entirely aquatic. The fur of the old males is tawny, and
makes a kind of mane over the shoulders, whence its name. Off San Francisco
there is a small rocky island, one of the ancient "rookeries" of these
sea-lions, where they are carefully preserved by the United States
Government as one of the sights of the bay. Another favourite haunt in old
days was on the Farralone Islands, thirty miles from the bay.

[Illustration: _By permission of Professor Bumpus_]     [_New York._

SEA-LION.

All sea-lions are polygamous. The males guard their harems very jealously,
and fight determinedly with any intruder.]

Southwards, towards the Antarctic, on the desolate and uninhabited coasts
and islets of the Far Southern Ocean, the most characteristic of the fauna
still remaining are the sea-lions. Formerly they swarmed in great packs,
crowding at the breeding-season the seaweed-covered rocks with their huge
and unwieldy forms, and at other times cruising in uncouth and noisy
companies in search of the fishes and squids, which they pursued like packs
of ocean-wolves. In spring the sea-lions used to struggle on to the flat
shore, where the equally aquatic tribes of penguins, which had lost the use
of their wings, covered acre after acre of rock with their eggs and young.
These the sea-lions devoured. When the men of the first exploring-ships
visited the penguins' nurseries, all the ungainly birds began to hop
inland, evidently taking the men for seals, and thinking it best to draw
them as far from their native element as possible. But the eared seals can
make good progress of a kind on land. When Captain Musgrave and his crew
were cast away for twenty months on the Auckland Islands, they found their
tracks on the top of a hill four miles from the water. Captain Musgrave
also saw the mother seals teaching their puppies to swim; they were by no
means inclined to do this, and were afraid of the water--fairly clear
presumptive evidence that seals have only recently, so far as natural time
is counted, taken to the aquatic life, and modified their form so
profoundly as they have.

The PATAGONIAN SEA-LION is perhaps the most numerous species, though its
numbers have been greatly reduced by whalers in search of skins and oil.
The first sea-lion ever brought to England was one of these. The Zoological
Society did not import it; they found it in the possession of a Frenchman
called Lecomte, who had taken it on the Patagonian coast, trained it, and
brought it home, where he showed it in a caravan. Its training was long and
difficult; it bit like a bull-dog, and Lecomte's limbs were scarred all
over with its bites. In spite of this it was the cleverest performing
animal ever seen up to that time in England. This sea-lion died from
swallowing a fish-hook concealed in some fish with which it was fed.
Lecomte was then sent out by the Zoological Society to obtain some more.
With the greatest difficulty several were secured, but all died on the
voyage to New York. Lecomte returned and obtained others, one of which he
succeeded in bringing to England. The cleverness of these animals--or
rather their power of understanding what they are required to do, and their
willingness to do it--probably exceeds that of any other animal, except the
elephant and the dog. Why this is so is not easy to conjecture, except that
the brain is more developed. They have been taught to fetch and carry on
dry land like a retriever, in addition to the well-known tricks exhibited
by those at the Zoo. One belonging to Barnum's Show caught
strawberry-punnets on its nose when they were thrown to it, and waved a
torch, which it held in its teeth and caught after tossing it into the air.

The sea-lions are much more powerful animals than the fur-seals. The male
of Steller's sea-lion attains a length of 10 feet and a weight of 1,000
lbs. The AUSTRALIAN SEA-LION is even larger than that of the North Pacific.
Some specimens are said to attain 12 feet in length. Captain Cook mentions
seeing male Patagonian sea-lions 14 feet long and from 8 to 10 feet in
circumference. Though none are now seen of such dimensions, skulls found on
the beach show that anciently some of the sea-lions were larger than any
now known.

FEMALE WALRUS.

This is a photograph of the only walrus which has ever been tamed and
taught to perform tricks. It was taken when she was two years old and
weighed 380 lbs. At that time she consumed 70 lbs. of boneless fish a day;
a year later not less than 100 lbs. satisfied her. She is now an inmate of
the Roumanian Zoological Gardens.]

It should be noted that all these creatures are carnivorous, yet the supply
of food for them never seems to fail, as undoubtedly it would were the
animals dependent for their food on land.


THE WALRUS.

The distinguishing features of the walrus have been mentioned in the
introductory remarks to this chapter. It should be added that it has an
external ear-passage, though no external ears, and very thick and bristly
whiskers. It is practically confined to the Arctic Circle, though once its
range extended to the British coasts (where its bones are found in the
Suffolk Crag) and to Virginia. The skull of one was found in the peat at
Ely--evidence that it once ascended rivers.

[Illustration: _By permission of the Hon. Walter Rothschild_]     [_Tring._

MALE WALRUS.

The "tusks" of the walrus are put to many practical uses during life, and
after death are much valued for the ivory.]

The walrus stands alone; it is a real monster of the deep. Strange and
awful stories were told of it by some of the early voyagers to the Arctic
Seas; but Captain Cook gave a very different account of his impressions of
the walruses which he saw on the north coast of America: "They lie in herds
of many hundreds on the ice, huddling over one another like swine. (They
lie just like a lot of pigs in a yard.) They roar and bray so very loud,
that in the night, or in foggy weather, they gave us notice of the vicinity
of the ice before we could see it. We never found the whole herd asleep,
some being always on the watch. These, on the approach of the boat, would
awaken those next to them; and the alarm being thus gradually communicated,
the whole herd would awake presently. But they were seldom in a hurry to
get away, till after they had been once fired at; they then would tumble
over one another into the sea in the utmost confusion. They did not appear
to us to be that dangerous animal which authors have described, not even
when attacked. Vast numbers of them would follow us, and come close up to
the boats; but the flash of the musket in the pan, or the bare pointing of
it, would send them down in an instant. The female will defend her young to
the last, and at the expense of her own life, whether in the water or upon
the ice; nor will the young one quit the dam, though she be dead; so that
if one be killed the other is certain prey." The long pendent tusks,
bristly whiskers, small bloodshot eyes, and great size lent colour to the
terrifying tales of the walrus. But more ancient voyagers than Captain Cook
told the truth--that the "morses," as they called them, were harmless
creatures, which often followed the ships from sheer curiosity. They sleep
on the ice like elephantine pigs, and dive and rout on the sea-bottom for
clams, cuttle-fish, and seaweeds. Probably the long tusks are used to rake
up mussels and clams; they also help the walrus to climb on to the ice. A
young walrus was kept for some time by the members of the
Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition, and was found to be an amusing pet. One kept
on board a Dundee whaler used to sleep with an Eskimo dog, and got into the
same kennel with it. It ate blubber and salt pork, but liked the sailors'
pea-soup better than anything else; it was most sociable, and could not
bear to be alone--would tumble down the hatchway to seek the society of its
beloved sailors, and scramble into the cabin if the door were open. When it
fell ill and before it died, it seemed most grateful for any attention
shown to it. The parent walrus shows the greatest courage in trying to
defend the young one. Walruses are now scarce; but as the ivory is the only
part of them of much present value, there is a chance that they may not be
killed off entirely.


THE TRUE SEALS.

The TRUE SEALS, with their greatly modified forms, heads set almost on to
their shoulders, with no neck visible, have well-developed claws on all the
toes, and in the typical species have double-rooted and small cheek-teeth.
The number of the incisors is variable. The GREY SEAL of the North Atlantic
is a large species which visits the North British coasts and the Hebrides.
One old male shot off the coast of Connemara weighed nearly 400 lbs., and
was 8 feet long. It is found off Scandinavia and eastwards to the coast of
Greenland, and breeds off our coasts in October and November. This is the
large seal occasionally shot up Scotch lochs. Its colour is yellowish grey,
varied with blots and patches of dirty black and brown.


THE COMMON SEAL.

This seal is smaller than the preceding. It breeds on parts of the Welsh
and Cornish coasts, and is found on both sides of the Atlantic and in the
North Pacific. It assembles in small herds, and frequents lochs, estuaries,
and river-mouths. In the summer it is fond of following flounders and
sea-trout up rivers. A few years ago one came up the Thames and was shot at
Richmond. The young are born in June, and are greyish white. The adults are
variously mottled with grey, brown, and black. The fondness of seals for
music is proverbial. Macgillivray, the Scotch naturalist, said that in the
Hebrides he could bring half a score of them within forty yards of him by a
few notes on his flute, when they would swim about with their heads above
water like so many black dogs. A seal was captured by the servants of a
landowner near Clew Bay, on the west coast of Ireland, and kept tame for
four years. It became so attached to the house that, after being carried
out to sea three times, it returned on each occasion. The cruel wretches
who owned it then blinded it, out of curiosity to see whether it could find
its way back sightless. The poor animal did so after eight days.

The common seal is still fairly numerous on the rocky western coasts of the
British Islands, though a few old seals, unable to forget their early
habits, appear now and then in Morecambe Bay and in the Solway. It is not
uncommon off the coasts of Caithness and Sutherland. It also frequents a
sandbank in the Dornoch Firth, though it has been much persecuted there.
The common seal is gregarious, while the grey seal usually lives only in
pairs, or at most in small companies. Two or three dozen like to lie
closely packed on shore with all their heads turning seawards. The white
hair of the young seals--which, as already said, are born in June--is shed
in a day or two, when the young take to the water. With regard to their
reputed musical proclivities, some experiments made at the Zoological
Gardens did not bear out this belief; but there is much evidence that in a
state of nature they will approach and listen to music. The common seal has
a large brain-capacity, and is a very intelligent creature. The upper parts
of this seal are yellowish grey, spotted with black and brown, the under
parts being silver-grey.

WALRUS AND SEA-LION.

Another photograph of the walrus tamed by Herr Carl Hagenbeck. Notice the
sea-lion in the right-hand corner, which also formed one of the same
performing troupe.]

The HARP-SEAL is an Arctic or ice-seal which sometimes finds its way to
Britain. The young are born on ice-floes. It is found in great herds in
Davis Straits, on the coasts of Greenland, and in the greater part of the
frozen Arctic Ocean. It is the animal which the sealing-vessels which hunt
seals for oil and "hair"--that is, the leather of the skins, not the
fur--seek and destroy. In the old days they could be seen in tens of
thousands blackening square miles of ice. They are still so numerous that
in Danish Greenland more than 30,000 are taken each year. The RINGED SEAL
is a small variety, not more than 3 or 4 feet in length, found in great
numbers in the Far North. Its flesh is the main food of the Eskimo, and its
skin the clothing of the Greenlanders. The seals make breathing-holes in
the ice. There the Eskimo waits with uplifted spear for hours at a time,
until the seal comes up to breathe, when it is harpooned. The BLADDER-NOSED
SEAL is a large spotted variety, with a curious bladder-like crest on the
head and nose of the male. Unlike all other seals, it sometimes resists the
hunters and attacks the Eskimo in their kayaks.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

GREY SEAL.

Seals are not so well adapted as sea-lions for getting about on the dry
land, and, except for their habit of coming ashore to bask in the sun, are
thoroughly aquatic.]

If any evidence were needed of the great destruction which the sealing and
whaling industry causes, and has caused, among the large marine animals,
the case of the ELEPHANT-SEALS ought to carry conviction. These are very
large seals, the male of which has a projecting nose like a proboscis. They
were formerly found both north and south of the Equator, their main haunts
being on the coast of California, and on the islands of the South Pacific
and Antarctic Ocean. They are gigantic compared with the common seals, some
of the males being from 16 to 20 feet long. Cuttle-fish and seaweed are the
principal food of this seal, which was formerly seen in astonishing
numbers. The whaling-ships which hunted both these seals and sperm-whales
at the same time almost destroyed those which bred on the more accessible
coasts, just as the earlier whalers entirely destroyed Steller's sea-cow,
and their modern descendants destroyed the southern right-whales. The
elephant-seal is now very scarce, and when one is killed the skin is
regarded as something of a curiosity.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

GREY SEAL.

Note the difference between the seal's and the sea-lion's hind flippers.
When on land, the seal advances by a jumping movement, produced by the
muscles of the body, assisted forward by the front flippers.]

In the records of the voyage of the _Challenger_ it is stated that there
were still great numbers of the elephant-seals surviving near Heard Island,
and not a few round the shores of Kerguelen Island. Professor Moseley
states that on the windward shore of Heard Island "there is an extensive
beach, called Long Beach. This was covered with thousands of sea-elephants
in the breeding-season; but it is only accessible by land, and then only by
crossing two glaciers. No boat can safely land on this shore; consequently
men are stationed on the beach, and live there in huts. Their duty is
constantly to drive the sea-elephants from this beach into the sea, which
they do with whips made out of the hides of the seals themselves. The
beasts thus ousted swim off, and often 'haul up,' as the term is, upon the
accessible beach beyond. In very stormy weather, when they are driven into
the sea, they are forced to betake themselves to the sheltered side of the
island. Two or three old males, which are called 'beach-masters,' hold a
beach for themselves and cover it with cows, but allow no other males to
haul up. They fight furiously, and one man told me that he had seen an old
male take a young one up in his teeth and throw him over, lifting him in
the air. The males show fight when whipped, and are with great difficulty
driven into the sea. The females give birth to their young soon after their
arrival. The new-born young ones are almost black, unlike the adults, which
are of a light slate-brown. They are suckled by the female for some time,
and then left to themselves, lying on the beach, where they seem to grow
fat without further feeding. They are always allowed by the sealers to lie
like this, 'in order to make more oil.' This account was corroborated by
all the sealers I met, but I do not understand it. Probably the cows visit
their offspring unobserved from time to time. Péron says that both parent
elephant-seals stay with the young without taking any food at all till the
latter are about six or seven weeks' old, and that the old ones conduct the
young to the water and carefully keep them company. The rapid increase in
weight is in accordance with Péron's account. Goodridge gives a somewhat
different story--namely, that after the females leave the young the old
males and the pups proceed inland, as far as two miles sometimes, and stop
without food for more than a month, during which time they lose fat. The
male sea-elephants come ashore for the purpose of breeding about the middle
of August, the females a little later."

Formerly the elephant-seals were found as far north as the Californian
coast, where their capture was the main business of the sealing-traders.
This species also formed the mainstay of the far southern sealers. As the
elephant-seals were killed off, so the business became less and less
profitable. It is to be hoped that the voyages of exploration to the
Antarctic ice-fringe will not lead to the discovery of fresh
sealing-grounds, for if this is the case there is little chance that any of
the southern seals will escape entire destruction. Some form of close time
has already been enforced in the pursuit of the hair-seals of Northern
Europe; but it is very desirable that the species still found on our own
coasts should also receive protection. Except when they paid visits to the
fixed salmon-nets, they never did any harm; and fixed nets are now illegal.
When a seal learned the use of the stake-nets, which these animals were
very quick to understand, it would wait quietly till it saw a fish caught,
and then swim up and carry it off before the fishermen could take it.

Two species--namely, the COMMON SEAL and GREY SEAL--still regularly visit
our shores. The common seal breeds on our south-western coasts, and the
grey seal off the Hebrides. If the common seal were accorded a close time,
its numbers would probably increase; and the spectacle of such interesting
creatures visible on our coast could not fail to be of great interest. All
the old legends of mermaids and wild men of the sea are based on the
capture of seals. Perhaps the most ancient is one which records such a
capture in the river near Orford Castle, in Suffolk, in the reign of Henry
II. The ignorant soldiers were persuaded that it was a man, and tortured it
to make it speak. They then took it to the church, and showed it the sacred
emblems. As it "showed no reverence," they took it back to the castle, and
fed it on fish. It was allowed to go into the river, but returned to its
captors of its own accord. Later it swam away to the sea. The monk who
recorded the story stated his conviction that this seal was an evil spirit
which had got into the body of a drowned sailor. A grey seal was taken not
many years ago in the creek leading up to the little town of Wells, in
Norfolk. It was so tame that the fishermen caught it by throwing coats over
it as it lay on the mud.

SEA-ELEPHANT.

These enormous seals (about 20 feet in length) are becoming very scarce.
When they come ashore, they are easily approached, though not so easily
killed. They are much valued for their oil. Note the trunk-like
prolongation of the nose, which, when the animal is excited, becomes
distended.]

CHAPTER IX.

_THE RODENTS, OR GNAWING ANIMALS._

The Rodents, or Gnawing Mammals, have all the same general type of teeth,
from which the order receives its distinctive name. There are a very large
number of families and of genera among the rodents, more than in any other
order of mammals. All the rodents possess a pair of long chisel-shaped
incisor teeth in each jaw. The ends of these teeth are worn into a sharp
edge which cuts like a steel tool. In most rodents these are the only teeth
in that part of the jaw, a wide gap intervening between them and the other
teeth. The hares, rabbits, and calling-hares have a minute pair of teeth
set just behind the large pair in the upper jaw. The grinding-teeth are set
far back, and are never more than six in number, these being sometimes
reduced to four. Rodents generally have five toes on the fore feet; in the
hind feet there are in some cases only four, or even three. None of the
species are of great size; the largest, the CAPYBARA, a water-living animal
of South America, is about the dimensions of a small pig. But the number of
species of small rodents is prodigious, and their fecundity so great that
they constantly increase in favourable seasons until they become a plague.
Voles, lemmings, field-mice, and rabbits are constant sources of loss to
agriculture in their seasons of extraordinary increase. Most rodents feed
on vegetables, though rats and mice have developed carnivorous tastes. No
rodents have canine teeth.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

CAPYBARA.

This, the largest of the Rodents, is found by the rivers of South America.]


THE SQUIRRELS.

Those of the order of Gnawing Animals which have only two incisors in each
jaw, and no rudimentary teeth like those possessed by the hares, are called
"Simple-toothed Rodents." Of those the family usually placed first in order
is that of the SQUIRRELS and their allies. The True Squirrels and Marmots
have five molar teeth on each side of the upper jaw.

[Illustration: _By permission of Professor Bumpus, New York._

FLYING-SQUIRREL.

One of the small species of the group.]

Squirrels are found in nearly every temperate part of the globe, from
Norway to Japan, and in very great numbers in India and the tropics.
Everywhere they are favourites; and though they do some mischief in highly
cultivated countries, they are among the most harmless of creatures. Most
of them live on wild nuts and the kernels of fruit; they suck eggs
occasionally, and in Canada will come to the traps in extreme cold and eat
the meat with which they are baited.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

FLYING-SQUIRREL.

The large flying-squirrels are mainly nocturnal. They can leap a distance
of 40 feet with the aid of the parachutes of skin stretching from the fore
to the hind limbs.]


THE RED SQUIRREL.

This, the common squirrel of England, is representative of the whole order.
In old Scandinavian legends the squirrel is represented as the messenger of
the gods, who carried the news of what was going on in the world to the
other animals. Together with its close relations, it is the most graceful
of all climbers of trees. With its long tail waving behind it, it races up
or down the trunks and across the forest from branch to branch as easily as
a horse gallops across a plain. It will descend the trunk head downwards as
fast as it runs up. Squirrels pair for life, and are most affectionate
little creatures, always playing or doing gymnastics together. The squirrel
builds a very good house, in which he shows himself far more sensible than
the monkeys and apes; it is made of leaves, moss, and sticks. The sticks
come first as a platform; then this is carpeted, and a roof put on. No one
who has seen English squirrels at work house-building has ever described
exactly how they do it; it is the best nest made by any mammal, thoroughly
well fitted together and waterproof. In this nest the young squirrels are
born in the month of June; that year they keep with the parents, and do not
"set up for themselves" till the next spring. The red colour is very
persistent in squirrels. One Chinese variety, black and red, has even
bright red teeth. In cold countries the red squirrels make stores of food,
but spend much of the winter asleep.

It is a great pity that in England no one tries to tame the squirrels as
they do in America; there they are the greatest ornament of the parks of
cities, coming down to be fed as tamely as our sparrows. The writer has
known one instance in which a lady induced wild squirrels to pay daily
visits to her bedroom for food; they used to climb up the ivy and jump in
at the open window. The great enemies of squirrels near houses are the
cats, which kill all the young ones when they first come down from the
trees. In a garden in Berkshire a pair of squirrels had a family every
summer for five years, but none ever survived the cats' persistent attacks.
These squirrels were most amusing and improvident. They used to hide
horse-chestnuts, small potatoes, kernels of stone fruit, bulbs of crocuses,
and other treasures in all kinds of places, and then forget them. After
deep snows they might be seen scampering about looking into every hole and
crevice to see whether that happened to be the place where they had hidden
something useful. Much of the store was buried among the roots of trees and
bushes, and quite hidden when the snow fell.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

DORSAL SQUIRREL FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.

A most beautiful species. The main colour is red, but the back is French
grey, and the tail French grey and red mingled.]


THE GREY SQUIRREL.

In Northern Europe, and across Northern Asia and America, a large grey
squirrel is found. From its fur the "squirrel-cloaks" are made. These
squirrels live mainly on the seeds of pines in winter, and on wild fruits,
shoots, and berries in summer. It has been noticed that they will entirely
forsake some great area of forest for a year or two, and as suddenly return
to it. The marten and the sable are the great enemies of the grey squirrel,
but the eagle-owl and goshawk also kill numbers of them. In many countries
the flesh of the squirrel is eaten.

ASIATIC CHIPMUNKS.

Small ground-squirrels which store food for the winter.]

The grey-and-black squirrel of the United States was thus described some
sixty years ago: "It rises with the sun, and continues industriously
engaged in the search for food for four or five hours every morning. During
the warm weather of spring it prepares its nest on the branch of a tree,
constructing it first of dried sticks, which it breaks off, or, if these
are not at hand, of green twigs as thick as a finger, which it gnaws off
from the boughs. These it lays in the fork of a tree, so as to make a
framework. It lines this framework with leaves, and over these again it
spreads moss. In making the nest, the pair is usually engaged for several
days, spending an hour in the morning hard at work. The noise they make in
cutting the sticks and carrying material is heard at some distance." In
winter they reside entirely in the holes of trees, where their young are in
most cases born. Green corn and young wheat suffered greatly from their
depredations, and a wholesale war of destruction used to be waged against
them everywhere. In Pennsylvania an old law offered threepence a head from
the public treasury for every squirrel destroyed, and in 1749 the enormous
sum of £8,000 was paid out of the public funds for this purpose. In those
days vast migrations of these squirrels used to take place, exciting not
only the wonder but the fear of the old settlers. In the Far North-west
multitudes of squirrels used to congregate in different districts, forming
scattered bands, which all moved in an easterly direction, gathering into
larger bodies as they went. Neither mountains nor rivers stopped them. On
they came, a devouring army, laying waste the corn- and wheat-fields, until
guns, cats, hawks, foxes, and owls destroyed them.

RED-FOOTED GROUND-SQUIRREL.

This species has some of the characteristics of the tree-squirrels, among
them the bushy tail.]


THE FLYING-SQUIRRELS.

One of the finest squirrels is the TAGUAN, a large squirrel of India,
Ceylon, and the Malacca forests. It is a "flying-squirrel," with a body 2
feet long, and a bushy tail of the same length. Being nocturnal, it is not
often seen; but when it leaps it unfolds a flap of skin on either side,
which is stretched (like a sail) when the fore and hind limbs are extended
in the act of leaping; it then forms a parachute. The colour of this
squirrel is grey, brown, and pale chestnut. There are a number of different
flying-squirrels in China, Formosa, and Japan, and in the forests of
Central America. One small flying-squirrel, the POLATOUCHE, is found in
North-east Russia and Siberia. It flies from tree to tree with immense
bounds, assisted by the "floats" on its sides. Though only 6 inches long,
it can cover distances of 30 feet and more without difficulty. Wherever
there are birch forests this little squirrel is found. One nearly as small
is a native of the Southern States of America, ranging as far south as
Guatemala.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

BLACK FOX-SQUIRREL.

The fur of this species is as valuable as that of the grey squirrel.]

In Africa, south of the Sahara, the place of the Oriental flying-squirrel
is taken by a separate family. They have a different arrangement of the
parachute from that of the flying-squirrels of India. This wide fold of
skin is supported in the Asiatic squirrels by a cartilage extending from
the wrist. In the South African flying-squirrels this support springs from
the elbow, not from the wrist; they have also horny plates on the
under-surface of the tail. Many of the tropical flying-squirrels are quite
large animals, some being as large as a small cat.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

LONG-TAILED MARMOT.

The marmots live by preference on high and cold mountains just below the
line of eternal snow in Europe. In Asia, where the snow-line is higher,
they are found at altitudes of 12,000 feet.]

Mr. W. H. Adams says of PEL'S FLYING-SQUIRREL, a West African species:
"These squirrels come out of their holes in the trees some hours after
sunset, and return long before daybreak. They are only visible on bright
moonlight nights. The natives say that they do not come out of their holes
at all in stormy weather, or on very dark nights; they live on berries and
fruits, being especially fond of the palm-oil nut, which they take to their
nests to peel and eat. They pass from tree to tree with great rapidity,
usually choosing to jump from a higher branch to a lower one, and then
climbing up again to make a fresh start.... They litter about twice in a
year, once in September. The young remain in the nest for about nine weeks,
during which they are fed by the old ones on such food as shoots and
kernels. They do not attempt to jump or 'fly' till the end of that period,
extending the length of their jumps with their growth."

The ETHIOPIAN SPINY SQUIRRELS have coarse spiny fur; the little INDIAN
PALM-SQUIRREL is marked with longitudinal dark and light stripes on the
back; others have light bands on their flanks.


THE GROUND-SQUIRRELS.

Many tree-living squirrels pass a good deal of their time on the ground;
but there are others which burrow like mice, and, though they climb
admirably, prefer to make their nest, and the regular squirrel's store of
nuts, in the earth, and not in the branches. The best known is the little
CHIPMUNK of the United States, the favourite pet of all American children.
There are many kinds of chipmunks, all of which have pouches in their
cheeks for carrying food. The commonest is the STRIPED CHIPMUNK. It is from
8 to 10 inches long, with white stripes, bordered with dark brown on each
side. The chipmunks' hoards of grain and nuts are so large that the Indians
used to rob them in times of scarcity. There is also a ground-squirrel in
Northern Europe and Northern Asia with much the same habits as the
chipmunk.

The burrows of the chipmunks are deep and extensive, and into them these
rodents convey such quantities of grain and maize as to inflict
considerable loss on the farmer. The SIBERIAN GROUND-SQUIRREL has been
known to conceal over 8 lbs. weight of corn in its hole. This has a
sleeping-chamber at the end, filled with moss and leaves, on which the
family sleep. From this side passages are dug, all leading to chambers
stocked with food, often far in excess of the wants of these provident
little creatures. The surplus stores are said to be eaten in the spring by
wild boars and bears.


THE PRAIRIE-DOGS AND MARMOTS.

Between squirrels which live in holes in the ground and the marmots and
their relations no great gap is found. These creatures drop the climbing
habit and increase that of burrowing. In disposition most of them are still
very squirrel-like, though they gain something in solemnity of demeanour by
never going far from their holes. A prairie-dog or marmot is like a
squirrel which has left society and settled down in a suburb. The little
creatures known in America as PRAIRIE-DOGS have in Northern Europe and the
steppes of Asia some first cousins, called SUSLIKS. Both live in colonies,
burrow quickly and well, feed on grass, and have a habit of sitting bolt
upright outside their holes, keeping a look-out for enemies. The
prairie-dogs also bark like a little dog when alarmed. Before going to
sleep, the latter always carry the dry grass on which they slept out of
their burrow, and carefully bite up into short lengths a fresh supply to
make their beds. The susliks and prairie-dogs are of a khaki colour, like
the sand in which they delight to burrow. Every one has heard that the
little burrowing-owls live in the same holes in company with the
prairie-dogs, and that the rattlesnake sometimes eats both the young
prairie-dogs and the young owls. An acquaintance of the writer who had
killed a rattlesnake actually took a young prairie-dog from its mouth. The
snake had not struck it with the poison, but had begun to swallow it
uninjured. It was still alive, and recovered.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

PRAIRIE-DOGS, OR MARMOTS.

A most characteristic picture. It shows the prairie-dogs' method of holding
their food while they eat, or cutting up grass to make their beds.]

The suslik was once found in England; its remains, with those of other
steppe animals, are found in the river gravels and brick earth in the
London basin. The prairie-dogs form a kind of connecting-link between the
susliks and the true marmots. They have short ears, short tails, rounded
bodies, and possess great powers of digging. When a prairie-dog has nothing
better to do, it usually spends its time either in digging holes or in
cutting up grass or anything handy to make its bed with. Young prairie-dogs
are not so large as a mouse when born. The adult animals feed almost
entirely on grass and weeds in their wild state; they seem quite
independent of water, and able to live in the driest places.

The ALPINE MARMOT is a much larger species than the prairie-dog. It lives
on the Alps just below the line of perpetual snow. From five to fifteen
marmots combine in colonies, dig very deep holes, and, like the
prairie-dogs, carefully line them with grass; they also store up dry grass
for food. In autumn they grow very fat, and are then dug out of the burrows
by the mountaineers for food. Young marmots used to be tamed and carried
about by the Savoyard boys, but this practice is now rare. The monkey is
probably more attractive to the public than the fat and sleepy marmot.
Marmots are about the size of a rabbit, and have close iron-grey fur.

Tschudi, the naturalist of the Alps, says of the marmots that they are the
only mammal which inhabits the region of the snows. No other warm-blooded
quadrupeds live at such an altitude. In spring, when the lower snows melt,
there are generally small pieces of short turf near their holes, as well as
great rocks, precipices, and stones. Here they make their burrows, outside
which they feed, with a sentinel always posted to warn them of the approach
of the eagle or lammergeir. The young marmots, from four to six in number,
are born in June. When they first appear at the mouth of the holes, they
are bluish grey; later the fur gains a brownish tint. The burrows are
usually at a height of not less than 7,000 or 8,000 feet. Winter comes on
apace. By the end of autumn the ground is already covered with snow, and
the marmots retire to sleep through the long winter. As they do not become
torpid for some time, they require food when there is none accessible; this
they store up in the form of dried grass, which they cut in August, and
leave outside their burrows for a time to be turned into hay.

The ALPINE MARMOT is also found in the Carpathians and the Pyrenees.
Another species, the BOBAC, ranges eastward from the German frontier across
Poland, Russia, and the steppes of Asia to Kamchatka. In Ladak and Western
Tibet a short-tailed species, the HIMALAYAN MARMOT, is found, sometimes
living at a height of nearly 17,000 feet. The GOLDEN MARMOT is found in the
Pamirs.


THE BEAVERS.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

AMERICAN BEAVER.

The engineering feats of the beavers, in damming streams and forming pools,
are the most remarkable achievements performed by living animals.]

The BEAVERS are classed as the last family of the squirrel-like group of
the Rodents, and the largest creatures of that order in the northern
hemisphere. The value of their fur has caused their destruction in great
measure where they were once numerous, and has led to their total
extirpation where there is evidence that they existed as a not uncommon
animal. They were formerly distributed over the greater part of Europe. In
England semi-fossilised remains show that they were not uncommon. In Wales
beavers' skins were mentioned in the year 940 in the laws of Howel Dha, and
in 1188 Giraldus stated that they were living on the river Teify, in
Cardiganshire. Beavers were formerly found in France, especially on the
Rhone, where a few are still said to survive, in Germany, Austria, Russia,
Poland, and in Sweden and Norway, on the rivers Dwina and Petchora, and on
the great rivers of Siberia. A few still remain in two districts of Norway,
and some were known to frequent the Elbe in 1878. The Moldau, in Bohemia,
is also credited with a colony; but parts of the Danube are believed to be
the chief haunt of the European beaver at the present time. The American
beaver, though its range has greatly contracted, is still sufficiently
numerous for its fur to be a valuable item in the winter fur-sales.

BEAVER.

The beaver here shown was kept as a pet. It was photographed upon a stream
in Scotland. The long upper fur is removed when the skin is prepared by the
furrier.]

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

BEAVER.

This is a photograph of a swimming beaver. Note the advantage which it has
taken of the eddy in the stream.]

The beaver's tail is flattened like a paddle and covered with scales; its
hind feet are webbed between the toes; it has sharp claws, which aid it in
scratching up mud, and a thick, close fur, with long brown hair above, and
a most beautiful and close under-fur, which, when the long hairs have all
been removed, forms the beaver-fur of which hats were once made, and
trimmings for ladies' jackets and men's fur coats are now manufactured.
There are two separate lines of interest in connection with the
animal--political and zoological. The value of the fur was anciently such
that, when the first French explorers began to search the Canadian lakes,
and later when the Hudson Bay Company succeeded to the French dominion, the
history of Canada was largely bound up with beaver-catching and the sale of
the skins. In the early days of the Company the "standard of trade" of the
North-west was a beaver-skin. For nearly a century the northern territories
were organised, both under French and English rule, with a view to the
beaver trade. The beaver was, and is, the crest of the Canadian Dominion.

MUSK-RAT.

A small water rodent, a native of the North American rivers. Immense
numbers are killed for the sake of their fur.]

The beavers' engineering feats have for their object to keep up a uniform
depth of water in the streams where they live. On large rivers there is
always enough water for the beaver to swim in safety from its enemies, and
to cover the mouth of the hole which it makes in the bank, just as a
water-rat does. But on small streams, especially in Canada, where during
the winter the frost prevents the springs from running, there is always the
danger that the water may fall so low that the beavers would be left in
shallow water, a prey to the wolverine, wolf, lynx, or human enemies. To
keep up the water, the beavers make a dyke or dam across the stream. This
they go on building up and strengthening until they have ponded back a
large pool. In time, as they never seem to stop adding to their dam, the
pool floods the ground on either side of the stream and makes a small lake.
It flows over the parts of the bank where their holes are; these also
become filled up, because the beavers carry into them every day fresh
quantities of wood-chips to make their beds. The beavers then scrape out
the earth on the top, pile sticks over this, plaster the sticks with mud,
and so build a dome over their bedroom. In time this is raised higher and
higher, the artificial lake rises too, and the complete "beaver-lodge"
surrounded with water is seen. The old trappers who found these _in situ_
imagined they were built at once and outright in the water. The experiments
and observations at Leonardslee, in Sussex, where Sir E. G. Loder has kept
beavers in a stream for ten years, show that the "evolution" of the lodge
is gradual and only incidental. But the building of the dyke, the cutting
of the trees, and the making of the pool are done with a purpose and
definite aim.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

GAMBIAN POUCHED RAT.

These rats are able to carry food in their cheek-pouches, which are used as
pockets.]

What this is, and how done, is explained in the following description of
the beaver colony at Leonardslee: "Their first object was to form in the
brook a pool, with water maintained at a constant height, to keep the mouth
of their burrow in the bank submerged during the droughts of summer. To
this end they built a dam, as good a specimen of their work as can be seen
even in Canada. Its situation was carefully chosen. A small oak, growing on
what appears to have been a projection in the bank, gives support to the
work. It may be concluded that this was part of their intention; for though
they have cut down every other tree in their enclosure to which they had
access, except two or three very large ones, they have left this small tree
which supports the dam untouched. (Later, when the dyke was stronger, they
cut it down.) Above this stretches the dam, some 12 yards wide, and rising
5½ feet from the base to the crest. The beavers built it solidly of battens
of alder, willow, larch, and other straight-limbed trees, cut into lengths
of from 2 to 3 feet. The bark of each was carefully gnawed off for food;
and the whole work, constructed of these cut and peeled logs, has a very
regular and artificial appearance. Smaller twigs and sticks are jammed in
between the battens, and the interstices are stuffed with mud, which the
beavers bring up from the bottom of the pool in their mouths, and push in
with their feet, making the whole structure as watertight as a wall." This
dam converted what was a narrow brook into a long lake, some 50 yards by 15
or 20 yards broad. Later the beavers made another larger dam below this,
cutting down some more trees. One tree gave them a great deal of trouble;
it was a beech, 40 feet high, and hard to gnaw; so they waited till the
water rose round it, and then _dug it up_. When the large dam was made,
quite a considerable lake was formed below the first. They then neglected
their first dam, and let the water run out of the top lake into the lower
one. At the time of writing there are five old beavers and a family of
young ones at Leonardslee. The work done by these beavers, so few in
numbers, shows how large colonies may alter the course of rivers.


THE DORMICE.

There are a considerable number of animals, even in England, which
hibernate. Most of these feed largely on insect food, which in winter is
unobtainable in any great quantity. Consequently the hedgehog and the
badger, which live largely on snails and worms, go to sleep in the famine
months. So does the sleepiest of all--the DORMOUSE. This alone would show
that this little rodent probably feeds on insects very largely, for if it
only ate nuts and berries it could easily store these, and find a good
supply also in the winter woods. It has been recently proved that dormice
are insectivorous, and will eat aphides, weevils, and caterpillars. But a
dormouse hibernates for so long a time that one might imagine its vitality
entirely lost; it sleeps for six months at a time, and becomes almost as
cold as a dead animal, and breathes very slowly and almost imperceptibly.
Mr. Trevor-Battye says that if warmed and made to awaken suddenly in the
winter it would die in a minute or two, its heart beating very fast, "like
a clock running down." Before their hibernation dormice grow very fat.
There is a large species, found in Southern Europe, which the Romans used
to eat when in this fat stage. In winter dormice usually seek the nest of
some small bird, and use it as a sleeping-place. They pull out and renew
the lining, or add a roof themselves. Into the interior they carry a fresh
supply of moss, and sleep there in great comfort. Their great enemy at this
time is the weasel. There are two main groups of the dormice, divided by
naturalists in reference to the structure of their stomach. The South
African GRAPHIURES have short tufted tails. The hibernating habit is
confined to the more northern species.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

POCKET-GOPHER.

The pocket-gophers are almost entirely subterranean. Their burrowing powers
are remarkable. The teeth as well as claws are used to aid them.]


THE MOUSE TRIBE.

This family, which includes the MICE, RATS, and VOLES, contains more than a
third of the number of the whole order of Rodents. Some are arboreal,
others aquatic; but most are ground-living animals and burrowers. The
number of known species has been estimated at 330. Among the most marked
types are the WATER-MICE of Australia and New Guinea, and of the island of
Luzon in the Philippines. The feet of the Australian species are webbed,
though those of the Philippine form are not. The GERBILS form another
group, mainly inhabitants of desert districts. They have very large eyes,
soft fur, and tails of various length and form in different species. They
have greatly developed hind legs, and leap like jerboas, and are found in
Southern Europe, Asia, and Africa. The PHILIPPINE RATS, large and
long-haired, and the TREE-MICE of Africa south of the Sahara, form other
groups. A very mischievous race of rodents is represented in Europe by the
HAMSTERS, and in the New World by a closely allied group, the WHITE-FOOTED
MICE.


THE HAMSTERS.

The HAMSTER is a well-known European species, and represents the group of
pouched rats. These creatures have cheek-pouches to aid them in carrying
food. In addition they are most voracious and inquisitive, so that the
hamster is a type throughout Central Europe of selfishness and greed. We
are sorry to add that John Bull occasionally appears in German cartoons as
the "Land-hamster," or land-grabber. Hamsters are numerous from the Elbe to
the Obi. They burrow and make cellars in the corn- and bean-fields, and
convey thither as much as a bushel of grain. As soon as the young hamsters
can shift for themselves, each moves off, makes a separate burrow, and
begins to hoard beans and corn. As the litter sometimes contains eighteen
young, the mischief done by the hamster is great. Its coloration is
peculiar. The fur, which is so thick as to be used for the linings of
coats, is a light yellowish brown above. A yellow spot marks each cheek.
The lower surface of the body, the legs, and a band on the forehead are
black, and the feet white. Thus the hamster reverses the usual natural
order of colour in mammals, which tends to be dark on the back and light
below. The animal is 10 inches long, and very courageous. Hamsters have
been known to seize a horse by the nose which stepped on their burrow, and
at all times they are ready to defend their home. Besides vegetables and
corn, they destroy smaller animals. They spend the winter in a more or less
torpid state in their burrows, but emerge early in spring. They then make
their summer burrows and produce their young, which in a fortnight after
birth are able to begin to make a burrow for themselves.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

LONG-EARED JERBOA.

These curious little animals are mainly desert creatures. They move by a
series of leaps.]

Among the South American members of the group to which the hamster belongs
are the FISH-EATING RATS, with webbed hind feet. The RICE-RAT, which is
found from the United States to Ecuador, lives on the Texas prairies much
as do the prairie-marmots, though its burrows are not so extensive, and
often quite shallow. In these the rats make beds of dry grass.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

CAPE JUMPING-HARE.

This animal is very common in South Africa. The Boers call it the
"Springhaas."]


THE VOLES.

The VOLES are allied to the preceding groups, but are marked externally by
a shorter and heavier form than the typical rats and mice. Their ears are
shorter, their noses blunter, their eyes smaller, and the tail generally
shorter. They are found in great numbers at certain seasons, when they
often develop into a pest. The SHORT-TAILED FIELD-VOLE is responsible for
much destruction of crops in Europe. One of the latest plagues of these
animals took place in the Lowlands of Scotland, where these voles devoured
all the higher pastures on the hills. Nearly at the same time a similar
plague occurred in Turkish Epirus. When an English commissioner was sent to
enquire into the remedies (if any existed) there in use, he found that the
Turks were importing holy water from Mecca to sprinkle on the fields
affected. The BANK-VOLE is a small English species, replaced on the
Continent by the SOUTHERN FIELD-VOLE.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

OCTODONT.

The octodonts, so called because they have four molar teeth on each side of
the jaw, are a group of rodents found mainly in South America.]

The WATER-RAT belongs to the vole group. It is one of the most commonly
seen of all our English mammals--probably, except the rabbit, the most
familiar. Although not entirely nocturnal, it prefers the darkness of
twilight; but whenever the visitor to the waterside keeps still, the
water-rats will allow him to watch them. The writer has had rather an
extensive acquaintance with these cousins of the beavers, and, while
watching them, has never ceased to be struck with their close resemblance
to those creatures. At Holkham Lake, in Norfolk, he noticed a willow-bush,
in which a number of twigs had been gnawed off; and then saw the missing
sticks lying neatly peeled, just like "beaver-wood," in the water below.
Waiting quietly, he noticed a water-rat climb into the bush, gnaw off a
willow twig, descend with it to the edge of the water, and there, sitting
on some crossed boughs, peel and eat the bark, just as a beaver does. By
the Thames a sound is often heard in the round reeds as of something
tearing or biting them; it is made by the water-rats getting their supper.
The rat cuts off three or four sedges and makes a rough platform. It then
cuts down a piece of one of the large round reeds full of pith, and,
holding it in its hands, seizes the bark with its teeth, and shreds it up
the stem, peeling it from end to end. This exposes the white pith, which
the rat then eats. Water-rats have been seen to swim out and pick up acacia
blossoms floating on the water. When swimming under water, each hair is
tipped by a little bubble, which makes the rat look like quicksilver. When
it comes out, the rat shakes itself with a kind of shiver, throwing all the
water off its coat. Though so good a swimmer, its feet are not webbed. It
is found from Scotland to the Bering Sea, but not in Ireland.

In the Far North the LEMMING takes the place of the voles. It is a very
small, short-tailed creature, like a diminutive prairie-dog. Like the
voles, lemmings have seasons of immoderate increase. They then migrate in
enormous flocks, and are said never to stop till they reach the sea, into
which they plunge. It is believed that they are following an inherited
instinct, and that where there is now sea there once was land, over which
they passed onwards.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Midland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

COYPU.

This is a large aquatic rodent, found on the South American rivers. Its
fur, called "nutria," forms a valuable export from Argentina.]

The MUSK-RAT inhabits the same waters as the beaver of North America. It
makes a house, generally of reeds piled in a mound, in the lakes and
swamps. The body is only 12 inches long, but the fur is thick and close,
and much used for lining coats and cloaks. The vast chains of rivers and
lakes in Canada make that country the favourite home of the musk-rat. This
creature lives upon roots of aquatic plants, freshwater-mussels, and stems
of juicy herbs. Besides making the domed houses of grass, reeds, and mud,
it also burrows in the banks of streams. There it makes rather an elaborate
home, with numerous passages leading to the water. The odour of musk is
very strong even in the skin. The tail is narrow and almost naked. This
species is the largest of the vole group.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

SHORT-TAILED HUTIA.

The hutias are another group of octodonts, found in the West India
Islands.]


THE TYPICAL RATS AND MICE.

These animals were originally an Old World group. Though the brown rat is
now common in America, it is believed to have come originally from China.

A very large number of animals are now almost dependent on man and his
belongings. Such creatures are said to be "commensalistic," or eaters at
the same table. They are often very unwelcome guests, whether they are
flies, sparrows, or cockroaches; but probably the least welcome of all are
the rats and mice. The BROWN RAT is the best known of any. It has come into
worse repute than usual of late, because it is now certain that it harbours
the plague-bacillus, and communicates the disease to man. Its habits and
appearance need no description. The BLACK RAT is the older and smaller
species indigenous in Europe, which the brown rat has almost extirpated
from England. A few old houses still hold the black rat, and there are
always a few wild ones at the Zoological Gardens which feed in the animals'
houses. The BLACK-AND-WHITE RAT (not the albino white rat) kept tame in
this country is probably a domesticated form of the ALEXANDRINE RAT of
Egypt.

The HOUSE-MOUSE is now found in all parts of the world to which Europeans
have access. In England its main home is in the corn-ricks. Were the
farmers to thresh the grain, as is done in the United States, as soon as it
is cut, mice would be far less common. Besides these parasitic mice, there
are a host of field- and forest-mice in this and other countries. One of
the best-known English species is the HARVEST-MOUSE, which makes a globular
nest of grass in the wheat-fields, attached to stems of corn or weeds. In
this the young are born. In winter the mouse lives in holes in banks, and
lays up a store of kernels and grain. The WOOD-MOUSE is larger than the
former, or than the HOUSE-MOUSE. It is yellowish brown in colour, lays up a
great store of winter food, and is itself the favourite prey of the weasel.

PORCUPINE.

The common porcupine is found in Italy, Spain, and North Africa. This one
was kept by Mr. Rothschild, who had it photographed by Mr. S. G. Payne, of
Aylesbury.]


THE BANDICOOTS.

A very mischievous class of rats is represented by the various species of
BANDICOOT. They are found throughout Southern Asia as far as Ceylon, and in
Kashmir and Turkestan. The BANDICOOT-RAT of India is a large and
destructive species which is sometimes brought to the London docks in
ships, but has not spread into the country.

PORCUPINE.

This photograph shows the arrangement of the porcupine's defence of spines;
but when frightened it erects these, so as to form a complete protection to
the body.]


OTHER MURINE RODENTS.

Among the numerous other rodents allied to the rat group are the MOLE-RATS,
with short mole-like bodies. The largest is the GREAT MOLE-RAT, found in
South-eastern Europe, South-western Asia, and North-eastern Africa. It is a
subterranean creature, burrowing for food like a mole. The BAMBOO-RATS have
minute eyes, small external ears, and a short tail partly covered with
hair. In Somaliland a small, almost naked SAND-RAT is found, which burrows
in the sand of the desert, throwing up little heaps like mole-hills.


THE GOPHERS.

In North and Central America the POCKET-GOPHERS form a curious group of
small rodents with cheek-pouches opening on the outside. They spend their
entire existence underground, and are said to use their incisor teeth as
picks to open the hard earth in their tunnels. They push the loosened soil
out by pressing it with their chests and fore feet. When a gopher has eaten
enough to satisfy the immediate calls of hunger, it stores all spare food
away in the large cheek-pouches. When gophers desire to empty the pouches,
they pass their feet along their cheeks from behind, and press the food
forwards on to the ground.


THE JERBOAS, SPRINGHAAS, AND JUMPING-MICE.

The hopping rodents have an immense range, from Southern Europe, through
Africa, Arabia, India, and Ceylon, and even in the New World, where the
AMERICAN JUMPING-MOUSE is found throughout the northern part of the
continent. The latter is only 3 inches long. The true JERBOAS are mainly
found in Africa. All these, when excited, move like kangaroos. Their main
home is the Central Asian steppe region, but they are found in Egypt,
India, Syria, and Arabia. The hind legs are much elongated, the fore legs
very small, and the body usually of a sandy colour. The American
jumping-mouse, though a very small creature, can cover from 3 to 5 feet at
each leap. It inhabits the beech and hard-wood forests. In winter it makes
a globular nest about 6 inches under the surface of the ground.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

VISCACHA.

The viscacha form colonies like those of the prairie-dogs. It is found on
the pampas north of the La Plata.]

The CAPE JUMPING-HARE forms a family by itself, with no near allies. It is
of a tawny brown colour, becoming almost pure white below.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford, Woburn Abbey._

CHAPMAN'S ZEBRAS.

These zebra have for some years been running loose in the park at Woburn
Abbey.]

The tail is long, and carried upright as the animal leaps. The head and
body are nearly 2 feet long, and the tail 20 inches. It is found both in
the plains and mountains of South Africa, where it makes deep burrows, in
which several families live. It is mainly nocturnal.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

CHINCHILLA.

A small rodent of the Andes, possessing very soft and valuable grey fur.]


THE OCTODONT FAMILY.

America is the main home of this family of rodents, though there are
several representatives in Africa. Their name is due to the fact that they
have four molar teeth on each side of the jaw. The best-known species is
the COYPU, or NUTRIA, of South America, an aquatic, fur-bearing animal. It
is very plentiful in the large rivers of that continent, where its fur is a
valuable commodity for export. When swimming, the female coypu carries its
young on its back. The coypu is usually 20 inches long, with a tail
two-thirds of the length of its head and body. The general colour is brown
above and brownish yellow below. Coypus live in pairs in holes in the
river-banks. In the Chonos Archipelago they frequent the seashore, and
burrow near the beach.

The HUTIA, another large octodont, is found in the West Indies. There are
two species, both partly arboreal. The TUCO-TUCOS, burrowing octodonts of
the pampas and the far south of the American Continent, are rat-like
animals, with large claws and very small eyes and ears.


THE PORCUPINES.

These animals are either tree-climbers or ground-dwellers. The former are
found in South America, though one, the CANADIAN PORCUPINE, is found in the
North; the latter are European and Asiatic. In Africa they are also common.
The Canadian porcupine passes nearly all its life in trees, feeding on the
leaves; but it has not a prehensile tail. The COMMON PORCUPINE is abundant
in Italy (where it is eaten by man), Greece, Spain, and Africa. It lives in
burrows or among rocks. In India a very similar species is found. The head
and shoulders of these ground-porcupines are not protected by the larger
sharp spines which guard the rest of their bodies.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

AGUTIS.

The agutis are also a South American group, found both in the forests and
on the plains.]

The tree-porcupines of the forests of Central America have long prehensile
tails, and are very lightly built. The quills are short, the head rounded,
and the appearance very different from that of the European or African
species. The common porcupine of Europe and North Africa measures about 28
inches in length from the nose to the root of the tail. The head, neck, and
shoulders are covered with short spines and hairs, and the shoulders and
back by a crest of long spines, varying from 12 to 15 inches in length. The
tail also carries spines.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

PACA, OR SPOTTED CAVY.

The pacas are among the larger rodents, found mainly in the northern part
of the South American region.]


VISCACHAS AND CHINCHILLAS.

On the plains of La Plata the commonest large rodent is the VISCACHA. It
assembles in societies like the prairie-dogs, but is a much larger animal,
from 18 inches to 2 feet long. Viscachas always set a sentinel to give
warning of danger. They cut every kind of vegetable near and drag them to
their holes; they also have a habit of picking up and collecting round the
burrows any object which strikes them as curious. Articles lost by
travellers, even whips or boots, may generally be found there. The viscacha
belongs to the chinchilla family, but differs much from the beautiful
creature of the high Andes from which chinchilla fur is taken. The COMMON
CHINCHILLA is about 10 inches long, and the SHORT-TAILED CHINCHILLA rather
smaller. The exquisite fur is well known. Two other chinchillas are more
like hares in appearance. All four creatures are found on the Andes.


THE AGUTIS AND PACAS.

South America also produces a family of rodents not unlike small pigs, but
nearer to the mouse-deer in general appearance; they are called AGUTIS.
Mainly forest animals, but living also in the plains, they feed on grass,
leaves, and plants of all kinds; they are very swift in their movements,
and have much the habits of the small South African bucks. The fur is long,
olive- or chestnut-coloured, and thick.

The PACAS are allied to the agutis, but are stouter; they live either in
burrows made by themselves, or in holes in the banks of rivers, or in old
tree-roots. The pacas are spotted and rather ornamentally marked; they are
found from Ecuador to Brazil and Paraguay.


THE CAVIES.

The DINOMYS, a spotted rodent known by one example from Peru, has been
thought to form a link between the pacas and the cavies, of which the
guinea-pig is the most familiar and the aquatic capybara the largest. The
original of our guinea-pig is believed to be the RESTLESS CAVY, a small
rodent common on the plains of La Plata. It is dark blackish, with
yellowish-grey and white hairs of the domesticated species; and it is
suggested that the original of the present name was "Guiana pig." This cavy
lives in thickets rather than in forests or plains.

The PATAGONIAN CAVY is a larger form, about twice the size of our hare. It
burrows in the ground, and has a grey coat, with yellowish markings on the
sides. It has been acclimatised successfully in France and England. The
flesh is like that of the rabbit.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

PACAS, OR SPOTTED CAVIES.

This photograph, which represents young animals, shows in great perfection
the linear arrangement of the stripes.]

The CAPYBARA is the largest of all rodents. This species is, in fact, a
gigantic water-guinea-pig. It is found in all the great rivers of South
America, from the Orinoco to the La Plata. It swims as well as a water-rat,
though it is as large as a small pig. It feeds on reeds, water-plants, and
grass. A capital photograph of this animal appears on page 146.

PATAGONIAN CAVY.

This large species of cavy has been acclimatised successfully both in
England and in France.]


PIKAS, HARES, AND RABBITS.

The last two families of the Rodents have a small pair of rudimentary
incisor teeth behind the large ones in the upper jaw. The PIKAS, or
CALLING-HARES, resemble the marmot tribe in general appearance. Their heads
are short, their ears rounded, and, being tailless, they still less
resemble the common hare; but their dentition marks them as allied. One
species, about 9 inches long, is found in Siberia; and another, only 7
inches long, in the Rocky Mountains. The former has a habit of cutting
grass and storing it in small stacks outside its hole for winter use; the
Rocky Mountain species carries its hay into its burrows.

The HARES are a widely distributed group. They are found from the north of
Scotland (where the grey mountain species turns white in winter) to the
south of India, in South Africa, and across the continent of Asia to Japan.
The MOUNTAIN-HARE takes the place of the brown species in Scandinavia,
Northern Russia, and Ireland; it is rather smaller, and has shorter ears
and hind legs.

[Illustration: _By permission of Professor Bumpus_]     [_New York._

WOOD-HARE.

This is one of the forms intermediate between the hares and rabbits.]

As early as 54 B.C., Cæsar, in his account of Britain, writes that the
COMMON HARE was kept by the ancient Britons as a pet, but not eaten by
them. It was protected by the Normans in the second list, or schedule, of
animals reserved for sport. The first list included the _Beasts of the
Forest_, the second the _Beasts of the Chase_, of which the hare was one of
the first. The word "chase" has here a technical meaning, by which was
understood an open park, or preserved area, midway in dignity between a
forest and an enclosed park. "Hare parks" were also made, perhaps the most
recent being that made at Bushey for the amusement of the sovereign when at
Hampton Court Palace. The name is often found surviving elsewhere. At
Hokham, the Earl of Leicester's seat in Norfolk, a walled park of 1,500
acres holds almost all the hares on the estate. If these parks and forest
laws had not existed at an early date, it is probable that the hare would
have become very scarce in this country.

Hares produce their leverets about the middle of April, though in mild
seasons they are born much earlier. The number of the litter is from two to
five. They are placed in a small hollow scraped out by the doe hare, but
not in a burrow of any kind.

The instinct of concealment by remaining still is very highly developed in
the hares and rabbits. They will often "squat" on the ground until picked
up rather than take to flight. This seems almost a perverted instinct; yet
hares often exhibit considerable courage and resource when escaping from
their enemies. The following is an instance:--A hare was coursed by two
young greyhounds on some marshes intersected by wide ditches of water. It
first ran to the side of one of these ditches, and doubled at right angles
on the brink. This caused the outer dog to lose its balance and to fall
heavily into the deep and cold water. The hare then made straight for the
line of walkers, and passed through them, with the other greyhound close
behind it. The dog reached out and seized the hare by the fur of the back,
throwing it down. The hare escaped, leaving a large patch of fur in the
dog's jaws, doubled twice, and was again seized by the second dog, which
had come up. It escaped from the jaws of the second pursuer, leapt two
ditches 12 feet wide, and then sat for a moment behind a gate on a small
bridge. This use of the only cover near caused the dogs to lose sight of
it; they refused to jump the second drain, and the hare escaped.

WILD RABBITS.

The wild rabbit has now spread to the north of Scotland, where this picture
was taken. It is also common in the Hebrides.]

The RABBIT is too well known to need description either of its habits or
appearance. It originally came from the countries south of the
Mediterranean, but is now common in Northern Europe, and has become a pest
in Australia and New Zealand. The rabbit breeds when six months old, and
has several litters in each year.

CHAPTER X.

_THE BATS AND INSECT-EATING MAMMALS._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

These two groups are really closely allied; but the bats are generally
considered apart, on account of their totally different mode of life.
Originally, like their more commonplace relatives, they were dwellers upon
the earth, or, more correctly, among the trees. By gradual modification of
the fore limbs, and a corresponding development of folds of skin attached
thereto, and to the body, they have acquired the power of flight. The
cobego, to be mentioned presently, gives us a hint of how this may have
come about.

The bats are the only members of the Mammalia which possess the power of
true flight. The so-called flying-squirrels do not rightly deserve this
title, for they have no wings. The wings of the bat have been formed by
modification of the fore limbs, the finger-bones having become excessively
lengthened, so as to serve as a support to a thin web of skin extending
outwards from the body, much as the ribs of an umbrella support the
covering. The hand of the bat is therefore a quite unique organ.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Croydon._

AUSTRALIAN FRUIT-BAT, OR "FLYING-FOX."

This photograph shows the "flying-fox" in its customary resting position. A
photograph of it flying is shown on page v of Introduction.]

The wing-membrane serves yet another purpose, for its sense of touch is
exceedingly delicate, enabling even blind bats (for bats are not blind
usually, as is popularly supposed) to avoid objects placed in their path.
Some bats, however, appear to depend also in some slight degree upon
hearing. The sense of touch is still further increased by the development
of frills or leaf-like expansions of skin round the nose and mouth, and by
the excessive development of the external ears. Delicate hairs fringing
these membranes probably act like the "whiskers" of the cat.

Insect-eating bats inhabiting regions with a temperate climate must in
winter, when food-supplies cease, either hibernate or migrate to warmer
regions. The majority hibernate; but two species at least of Canadian bats
perform extensive migrations, it is supposed to escape the intense cold.

The power of flight has made the bats independent of the barriers which
restrict the movements of terrestrial animals, and accordingly we find them
all over the world, even as far north as the Arctic Circle. But certain
groups of bats have an extremely restricted range. Thus the Fruit-bats
occur only in the warmer regions of the Old World, the Vampires in America,
whilst some of the more common insect-eating forms are found everywhere.
Those forms with a restricted distribution are, it should be noticed, all
highly specialised--that is to say, they have all become in some way
adapted to peculiar local conditions, and cannot subsist apart therefrom.
It is the more lowly--less specialised--forms which have the widest
geographical range. There are some spots, however, on the world's surface
from which no bat has yet been recorded--such are Iceland, St. Helena,
Kerguelen, and the Galapagos Islands.

[Illustration: _Photo by Henry King_]     [_Sydney._

AUSTRALIAN FRUIT-BATS.

In their roosting-places these bats hang all over the trees in enormous
numbers, looking like great black fruits. Although shot in thousands, on
account of the damage they do to fruit orchards, their numbers do not
appear to be reduced.]

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

TUBE-NOSED FRUIT-BAT.

The tubular nostrils distinguish this and a species of insect-eating bat
from all other living mammals.]


THE FRUIT-BATS.

These represent the giants of the bat world, the largest of them, the
KALONG, or MALAY FOX-BAT, measuring no less than 5 feet from tip to tip of
the wing. The best known of the fruit-bats is the INDIAN FOX-BAT. Sir J. E.
Tennent tells us that a favourite resort of theirs near Kandy, in Ceylon,
was some indiarubber-trees, "where they used to assemble in such prodigious
numbers that large boughs would not infrequently give way beneath the
accumulated weight of the flock." An observer in Calcutta relates that they
occasionally travel in vast hordes, so great as to darken the sky. Whether
they are performing some preconcerted migration or bent only on a foray to
some distant feeding-ground is a matter for speculation. These hordes are
quite distinct from the "long strings" which may be seen every evening in
Calcutta on their way to neighbouring fruit-trees.

One of the most remarkable of this group is the TUBE-NOSED FRUIT-BAT, in
which the nostrils are prolonged into a pair of relatively long tubes.
Strangely enough, a group of insect-eating bats has developed similar
though smaller tubes. Except in these bats, such tubes are unknown among
mammals. Their function is not known.

[Illustration: _Photo by Fratelli Alinari_]     [_Florence._

PIPISTRELLE BAT.

This is one of the commonest of the British bats. It is the first to appear
in the spring, and the last to retire at the fall of the year.]


INSECT-EATING BATS.

The vast majority of the bats comprising this group feed exclusively on
insects. Some, however, have acquired the habit of fruit-eating, like the
true fruit-bats; and a few have developed quite ogre-like habits, for they
drink blood--indeed, they subsist upon nothing else. This they obtain from
animals larger than themselves.

Many of the bats of this group have developed curious leaf-like expansions
of skin around the nose and mouth, which are supposed to be endowed with a
very delicate sense of touch. In some, as in the FLOWER-NOSED BAT, the
nose-leaf is excessively developed, forming a large rosette. The upper
border of this rosette is furnished with three stalked balls, the function
of which it is surmised is probably ornamental--from the bat's point of
view. To our more æsthetic taste the whole effect is hideous.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

LEAF-NOSED BAT.

The leaf-nosed are the most highly organised of all the bats. The
remarkable leaf-like folds of skin around the nose or chin, as the case may
be, serve as delicate organs of perception. There are numerous species of
leaf-nosed bats.]

Limited as is our space, we cannot pass over the SUCKER-FOOTED BATS. These
are met with, strangely enough, in countries so far apart as Brazil and
Madagascar. The suckers from which they derive their name, in the Brazilian
species, are small circular, hollow disks, attached to the thumb and the
sole of the foot, recalling the suckers of the cuttle-fish and brown
water-beetle. By their means the animal is enabled to climb over smooth
vertical surfaces.

A white bat is a rarity in the bat world. We cannot therefore afford to
pass without mention the fact that Central and South America possess two
species of WHITE BATS. This colour is probably developed for protection's
sake, the bats being found nestling between the silvery leaves of a
cocoanut-palm. Brilliant coloration, on the other hand, is by no means so
rare. WELWITSCH'S BAT, for instance--a West African species--is remarkable
for its gorgeous coloration, the colours being orange and black. An Indian
species, known as the PAINTED BAT, is said to be so brilliantly coloured as
to resemble a gorgeous butterfly rather than a bat.

[Illustration: _Photo W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Croydon._

COBEGO.

Back view of the cobego, with the limbs extended, showing the great size of
the flying-membranes, or parachute.]

Ugliness is more common than beauty amongst the bats, and perhaps the
ugliest of all the tribe is the NAKED BAT of the Malayan region. It is
absolutely repulsive. The skin is naked, save for a collar of hair round
the neck; whilst on the throat it gives rise to an enormous throat-pouch,
which discharges an oily fluid of a peculiarly nauseating smell. On either
side of the body is a deep pouch, in which the young are carried--a very
necessary provision, for they would be quite unable to cling to the body of
the parent, as do the young of fur-bearing bats, on account of the naked
skin.

Of the great group of the VAMPIRE-BATS we can only make mention of the
blood-sucking species. These are natives of South America. It is to Dr.
Darwin that we owe our first absolutely reliable information about these
little animals. Before the account in his Journal, it was uncertain to
which of the vampires belonged the unenviable distinction of being the
blood-sucker. During the stay of the great naturalist in Chili one was
actually caught by one of his servants, as evening was drawing on, biting
the withers of a horse. In the morning the spot where the bite had been
inflicted was plainly visible, from its swollen condition. These two
species, it has been stated, "are the only bats which subsist entirely on a
diet of blood, yet it is possible that ... some of the JAVELIN-BATS or
their allies may on occasion vary their ordinary food with it."


THE INSECTIVORA, OR FLIGHTLESS INSECT-EATERS.

Some members of this group have departed from the traditional insect diet.
Thus the cobego feeds upon leaves, a curious aquatic shrew--the Potamogale
of West Africa--upon fish, and the moles upon worms.

The group has a very wide geographical distribution, but there are
nevertheless large portions of the globe in which they are conspicuous by
their absence. They are never found in Australia or South America.
Madagascar, Africa, and the West India Islands produce the most remarkable
forms.

COBEGO.

Vertical (front) view of the cobego, with newly born and naked young
attached. Note the extension of the membrane between the toes of the fore
feet of the adult.]


THE COBEGO.

This is a peculiarly interesting animal, which lives in the forests of
Sumatra, Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippine Islands. It dwells
among the trees, moving from one to another by taking flying leaps through
the air, covering as much as seventy yards at a jump. Prodigious leaps like
this would be quite impossible but for the fact that the animal, which is
almost as large as a cat, is provided with a sort of parachute, formed by a
broad web of skin stretched between the body on either side and the fore
and hind limbs, and between the hind limbs and the tail.


SHREWS, HEDGEHOGS, AND TENRECS.

The variation in form presented by the members of this group is
considerable. The most noteworthy examples of this variation are furnished
by the pretty little squirrel-like TREE-SHREWS of India and Borneo and
neighbouring lands, the mouse-like JUMPING-SHREWS of Africa, the HEDGEHOGS,
the TENRECS, the elegant little MOUSE-LIKE SHREWS of almost world-wide
distribution, and the WATER-SHREWS. Of these, hedgehogs and tenrecs have
undergone the greatest transformation. By a curious modification of their
original hairy covering they have developed a formidable armour of sharp
spines. When alarmed, the former roll themselves up into a ball by the
contraction of powerful muscles, and so present an almost impregnable
armour to an enemy. Stoats and foxes, however, appear at least occasionally
to succeed in overcoming this defence and making a meal of the vanquished.

Tenrecs are found in Madagascar. The COMMON TENREC is the largest of all
insect-eaters, and one of the most prolific, as many as twenty-one having
been produced at birth. Of all living mammals it is the one most nearly
allied to the Marsupials.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Croydon._

COBEGO ASLEEP.

All four limbs are used in suspending itself when asleep, as in the sloths.
In this position the cobego closely resembles, and is mistaken by its
enemies for, the fruits of one of the native trees. It is a nocturnal
animal.]

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Melland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

THREE BABY HEDGEHOGS.

Young hedgehogs are born blind and naked. The spines on their first
appearance are quite soft; they soon harden, and at the same time the power
to roll the body up into a ball is acquired.]


THE MOLES.

The COMMON MOLE shows a most perfect adaptation to its underground mode of
life. The general form of the animal is long, cylindrical, and pointed in
front, whilst the legs are exceedingly short, the foot only in the fore
limb projecting from the body. This foot is very broad and spade-like and
immensely powerful, its use being to force a way--often with incredible
speed--through the soft, yielding soil, and not to support the body, as in
running or walking. The hind feet are weak, but resemble those of its
allies the shrews, for instance. The eyes have become reduced to mere
vestiges, very difficult to find. The fur has become so altered in
structure that it will lie equally smooth whether brushed towards head or
tail, so that it should not be damaged when the animal travels backwards in
its burrow. External ears have been dispensed with.

Worms form the staple diet of the mole, but besides underground insects of
all kinds are greedily devoured. This animal is one of the most voracious
feeders, falling ravenously upon its prey. It has been said with truth that
so great is the ferocity displayed by the mole that if it could be
magnified to the size of the lion it would be one of the most terrible of
living creatures. That a constant supply of food is necessary to satiate
its enormous appetite is shown by the fact that a mole will succumb to an
abstinence of from ten to twelve hours. Moles fight among themselves
furiously; and if two are confined together, the weaker will be attacked
and devoured. They take readily to the water, and instances of moles
observed in the act of crossing streams are numerous.

It is a curious fact, but the mole is unknown in Ireland; yet it ranges
from England in the west through Asia to Japan.

Careful observation seems to have shown that with the common mole males are
more numerous than females. Whether this is true of other species remains
to be seen. The moles of North America form a group distinct from those of
the Old World, though closely allied thereto. The WEB-FOOTED and the
STAR-NOSED MOLES are the most interesting of the American forms.

Speaking of the prodigious speed with which these animals burrow their way
through the ground, Dr. Hart Merriam remarks that in a single night, after
rain, they have been known to make a gallery several yards in length, and
that he had himself traced a fresh tunnel for nearly a hundred yards. As he
says, we can only appreciate the magnitude of this labour by comparison,
and "computation shows that, in order to perform equivalent work, a man
would have to excavate in a single night a tunnel thirty-seven miles long,
and of sufficient size to easily admit of the passage of his body."

The star-nosed mole is peculiar in that its nose is surrounded by a ring of
finger-like processes, forming a kind of rosette, which probably acts as a
highly sensitive organ of touch; furthermore, it differs from other moles
in the great length of its tail, which is nearly as long as its body. Like
the mole, this species makes its way through the ground with great speed.

Beneficial as moles undoubtedly are in destroying worms and obnoxious
insects, yet they are regarded as a pest both by the farmer and gardener.
That there is some justification for this dislike must be admitted; for the
farmer suffers in that, in the search for food, crops are damaged by
cutting through the roots of plants--the gardener not only for the same
reason, but also because the ridges and hillocks which they make in their
course disfigure the paths and beds of a well-kept garden.

The nearest allies of the moles are the curious aquatic DESMANS of Russia,
and the SHREWS, some of which are quite mole-like in form, owing to their
having adopted a similar mode of life.

GOLDEN MOLE.

This is found only in South Africa. The name is derived from the wonderful
metallic lustre of the fur: the brilliancy of the hues is intensified by
immersion in spirit.]

The BURROWING SHREWS are not the only forms in the great group which have
assumed a mole-like shape, for allied to the hedgehog-like TENRECS is a
remarkable animal known as the GOLDEN MOLE. The mole-like shape of the body
of this animal is another instance of adaptation to a similar mode of life.
The fore limb of the golden mole is provided with huge claws, which are
used for digging purposes; the hand is not broadened out spade-like, as in
the common mole, the claws rendering this unnecessary.

A FINE TUSKER.

The male Indian elephant has smaller tusks than the African species.]

At once the mightiest and most majestic of all terrestrial mammals, the
elephant appeals to the imagination more forcibly than any other living
animal, not only on account of its great sagacity and the strangeness and
singularity of its outward appearance, but also because it is such an
obvious link between the world of to-day and the dim and distant past of
Pleiocene and Miocene times.

There are two existing species of elephant, the AFRICAN and the ASIATIC,
the latter, from the structure of its molar teeth and the shape of its
skull, appearing to be very nearly related to the MAMMOTH, which lived upon
the earth in comparatively recent times--geologically speaking--and was
undoubtedly contemporary with man in Europe during the Stone Age.

There are very considerable differences both in the external appearance and
also in the habits of the two existing forms of elephant. In the African
species the forehead is more convex and the eye relatively larger than in
its Asiatic cousin; and whilst the ears of the latter are only of moderate
size, those of the former are so large that they at once arrest the
attention, and are one of that animal's most remarkable external
characteristics. Both sexes of the African species, with few exceptions,
carry well-developed tusks, but in the Asiatic form the tusks of the
females are so small as scarcely to protrude beyond the jaws. In Asia, too,
tuskless bull elephants are common, whilst males of the African species
without tusks are extremely rare. The latter species has but three nails on
the hind foot, the Asiatic elephant four. In the African species the middle
of the back is hollowed, the shoulder being the highest point, whilst in
the Asiatic elephant the back is arched, and the top of the shoulder lower
than the highest part of the back. The extremity of the proboscis is also
different, in the two species, the African elephant being furnished with
two nearly equal-sized prolongations, the one on the front, the other on
the hinder margin, with which small objects can be grasped as with the
finger and thumb of the human hand, whilst in the Asiatic species the
finger-like process on the upper margin of the end of the trunk is
considerably longer than that on the under-side. In external appearance the
skin of the African elephant is darker in colour and rougher in texture
than that of the Asiatic form. The molar teeth of the former animal are,
too, of much coarser construction, with fewer and larger plates and thicker
enamel than in the latter, which would naturally lead one to suppose that
the African elephant is accustomed to eat coarser, harder food than the
Asiatic species. This supposition is borne out by fact; for whilst the
Asiatic elephant feeds mainly upon grass, the leaves and fruit of the wild
plantain, and the young shoots of the bamboo, together with the leaves,
twigs, and bark of certain trees, the African species never eats grass,
and, although very fond of certain kinds of soft and succulent food, such
as wild fruits and the inner bark of certain trees, is constantly engaged
in chewing up the roots and branches of trees as thick as a man's wrist for
the sake of the sap and bark, the woody portions being rejected after
having been reduced to pulp. The Asiatic elephant appears to be far less
tolerant of exposure to the heat of the sun than the African; and whilst
the latter may often be found standing at rest or sleeping throughout the
hottest hours of the day in long grass or scrubby bush of a height not
sufficient to afford any protection from the sun to the whole of the upper
portion of the head and body, the former, when in a wild state, is said to
always seek the shade of the densest forests it can find during hot
weather.

A YOUNG INDIAN ELEPHANT.

This animal has been trained to "salute" by raising its trunk and foot. It
has lost the end of its tail.]

The Asiatic elephant often lies down when resting and sleeping. This is in
marked contrast to the African species, which, if it ever does lie down at
all, except to roll in mud or rub itself against an ant-heap, can only do
so very rarely, since in all my experience, though I have seen some
thousands of African elephants standing sleeping during the heat of the
day, I have never yet seen one of these animals lying down, nor found the
impress in the ground where one had been so lying.

When excited and charging, both species of elephant raise their heads and
cock their ears, which in the African animal stand out at such a time like
two sails, and, being each upwards of 3½ feet in breadth, cover, together
with the animal's head, an expanse of fully 10 feet. The Asiatic elephant
is said to remain mute whilst charging, and to hold its trunk tightly
curled up between its tusks. The African elephant, on the other hand,
usually accompanies a charge with a constant succession of short, sharp
trumpeting screams. Sometimes, though rarely, however, animals of this
species remain mute whilst charging, but they never, I believe, coil their
trunks up under their throats. Often an African elephant will swing round
for a charge with a loud scream and trunk held high in the air; but in my
experience, when settling down to a chase, it drops its trunk and holds it
pointing straight down in front of its chest.

THE CHIEF OF CHIENGMAI'S CARRIAGE.

This victoria was drawn by a young Indian elephant.]

In the southern portions of the African Continent the average standing
height at the shoulder of full-grown bull elephants ranges from 10 feet to
10 feet 6 inches, though individuals have doubtless been met with in those
districts which have much exceeded these dimensions. In North Central
Africa the average standing height appears to be some inches higher,
approaching 11 feet, and in those districts it is quite possible that
individuals exist which exceed 12 feet in height. African cow elephants
stand from 8 feet to 8 feet 6 inches at the shoulder. The Asiatic species
is considerably smaller than the African, the average height of full-grown
males not exceeding 9 feet, though certain individuals now and then attain
to a much greater size, as is indicated by the fact that there is a mounted
skeleton of an Indian elephant in the Museum at Calcutta which stands 11
feet 3 inches at the shoulder. In the size of its tusks the African
elephant far surpasses the Asiatic species. In India a pair of tusks
measuring 5 feet in length and weighing 70 lbs. the pair would, I think, be
considered large, though an elephant was killed by Sir Victor Brooke in the
Garo Hills with a single tusk measuring 8 feet in length, 17 inches in
circumference, and weighing 90 lbs., and a few tusks even exceeding these
dimensions have been recorded. In Southern Africa the tusks of full-grown
bull elephants usually weigh from 80 to 120 lbs. the pair, and measure
about 6 feet in length, with a circumference of from 16 to 18 inches; but
these weights and measurements have often been much exceeded, and in my own
experience I have known of two pairs of elephants' tusks having been
obtained south of the Zambesi, each of which weighed slightly over 300
lbs., each tusk measuring upwards of 9 feet in length, whilst a single tusk
brought from the neighbourhood of Lake Ngami in 1873 weighed 174 lbs. The
average weight of cow-elephant tusks in Southern Africa is from 20 to 30
lbs. the pair, but I have seen the tusk of a cow elephant killed in
Matabililand which weighed 39 lbs. and measured over 6 feet in length,
whilst its fellow almost equalled it in size and weight. In North Central
Africa, according to Sir Samuel Baker, the tusks of full-grown elephants
average about 140 lbs. the pair, and tusks weighing upwards of 100 lbs.
each are not at all uncommon, whilst many of a much greater size have been
obtained.

TIMBER-ELEPHANTS.

This photograph was taken at Lakou, in Upper Siam. Notice the large teak
log in the foreground.]

Until quite recently a tusk in the possession of Sir E. G. Loder, which
weighs 184 lbs. and measures 9 feet 5 inches in length, with a
circumference of 22½ inches, was supposed to be the largest in existence;
but in 1899 two tusks were obtained near Kilimanjaro, in East Central
Africa, both of which much exceed this weight. These enormous tusks were at
first stated to be a pair taken from a single elephant; but though nearly
equal in weight they are said to be differently shaped, and as their
history is not yet fully known it is possible, though not probable, that
they originally belonged to two different elephants. The larger of these
two tusks has recently been purchased for the collection of the British
Museum (Natural History), where it may now be seen. It weighs 228 lbs.,
measures 10 feet 2½  inches on the outside curve, and 24¼ in girth at the
thickest part. The tusks of cow elephants are also considerably larger and
heavier on the average in East Central and North Central Africa than in the
southern portions of the continent.

[Illustration: _Photo by M. E. F. Baird, Esq._

FEMALE INDIAN ELEPHANT DRAGGING TEAK.

The teak logs are floated down the Burmese rivers and dragged out by
elephants.]

At the present time the Asiatic elephant is found in a wild state in most
of the forest-covered tracts of India, Ceylon, Assam, Burma, Siam,
Cochin-China, Sumatra, and Borneo; whilst the African species, although it
has been hunted out of large tracts of country in South and South-western
Africa, still inhabits the greater part of the continent south of the
Sahara, and in many districts of Central Africa appears to be
extraordinarily abundant. In the Cape Colony two herds still exist under
the protection of the Government.

As might be expected from the greater length of its legs, and consequent
longer stride, the African elephant is admitted by those who have had
experience of both species to be a more active animal than its Asiatic
cousin. Speaking of the walking and running powers of the Indian elephant,
that great authority Mr. Sanderson says that "the only pace of the elephant
is the walk, capable of being increased to a fast shuffle of about fifteen
miles an hour for very short distances. It can neither trot, canter, nor
gallop. It does not move with the legs on the same side, but nearly so. A
very good runner might keep out of an elephant's way on a smooth piece of
turf, but on the ground in which they are generally met with any attempt to
escape by flight, unless supplemented by concealment, would be unavailing."
This description exactly coincides with my own experience of the African
elephant, except that I think that animals of the latter species,
especially cows and young bulls, are capable of getting up a pace of at
least twenty miles an hour, and keeping it up for from 100 to 200 yards,
when charging.

[Illustration: _Photo by M. E. F. Baird Esq._

INDIAN ELEPHANTS BATHING.

These animals love a bath, and will walk on the bottom of a deep river with
only their trunks raised above the water.]

In disposition both African and Asiatic elephants are as a rule timid
animals, and, excepting in the case of males of the latter species when
suffering from sexual excitement, are always inclined to shun danger. I
have never heard of male elephants of the African species becoming savage
and aggressive at any season of the year; indeed, old bulls always appeared
to me to be less inclined to charge than cows or young bulls. The eyesight
of the elephant--of the African species at least--is bad, and his hearing
not particularly acute; but his olfactory nerves are probably more highly
developed than in any other animal, and, aided by this exquisite sense of
smell, he will avoid a human being if possible. But if elephants are
attacked and wounded, they become savage and dangerous animals; and the
charge of an African elephant, coming on with the great ears outspread, to
the accompaniment of a quick succession of short, sharp trumpeting screams,
besides being very sudden and rapid, is very disconcerting to the nerves of
a man unaccustomed to such experiences. I remember the case of a young
Englishman who was killed in Matabililand many years ago by the first
elephant he had ever seen. This animal--an old bull--had retired, after
having been wounded, into a small but dense patch of thorn-bush, into which
its pursuer thought it unadvisable to follow on horseback. He therefore
left his horse, and advanced on foot towards the cluster of trees amongst
which the elephant was concealed. The latter, having either seen or smelt
the approaching enemy, at once charged out, screaming loudly; and the young
hunter, instead of standing his ground and firing at the advancing monster,
lost his presence of mind, and, turning, ran for his horse; but before he
reached it he was overtaken and killed. It seemed to the friend who found
his body (he was close at hand shooting another elephant at the time, and
pieced the story together from the tracks of man, horse, and elephant) that
the victim had first been struck in the back of the head by one of his
pursuer's tusks--at any rate his skull had been smashed to pieces and
emptied of its brains. Then the elephant had rushed upon him where he fell,
and, after first having driven a tusk right through his chest and deep into
the ground, had stamped him into a bloody pulp with his huge feet. A waggon
was brought the same night, and the mangled body carried to the hunter's
camp on the banks of the Ramokwebani, where it was buried.

The strength of the elephant is proverbial; and in India and Burma, where
this animal has for ages past been trained in the service of man, this
power is habitually made use of in moving and stacking large baulks of
timber, or in dragging heavy guns through muddy ground or up steep ascents.
In Africa the traveller is often astonished at the size of trees which have
been uprooted and overturned by elephants. These trees, however, have no
taproot, and have not therefore a very firm hold in the ground, especially
during the rainy season, when the ground is soft. At this time of year
large trees are butted down by elephants, which push against their stems
with the thick part of their trunks, and get them on the swing, until the
roots become loosened and the trees are at last overturned. Small trees of
2 or 3 inches in diameter, as well as branches, they break off with their
trunks. In 1878 a tuskless bull elephant--I met the same animal again in
1885, and he is the only African bull elephant without tusks I have ever
seen--killed a native hunter in Mashonaland. This man, a big powerful Zulu
and a great friend of my own, was torn into three pieces. I imagine that,
after having caught him, the elephant held the unfortunate man down with
his foot or knee, and then, twisting his trunk round his body, tore him
asunder--surely a terrible exhibition of strength.

The elephant is a very slow-growing and long-lived animal, not arriving at
maturity until upwards of thirty years of age; and since cases are on
record of elephants having lived for upwards of 130 years in captivity in
India, it is probable that in a wild state these animals, both in Asia and
Africa, often attain to an age of 150 years. The female elephant produces,
as a rule, but one calf at birth, the period of gestation lasting from
eighteen to nearly twenty-two months. The mammæ of the cow elephant are
placed between the fore legs, and the new-born calf sucks with its mouth,
holding its trunk turned back over its head. I have seen elephant calves so
engaged.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

AFRICAN ELEPHANT.

The difference in profile between this and the Indian species is
noticeable. The forehead is receding and the ears much larger in the
African species.]

Although there is no reason to doubt that the African elephant is as
intelligent as the Asiatic species, its domestication has never been
attempted by the Negro or Bantu races of Africa. It is believed, however,
that the African elephant was in ancient times domesticated by the
Carthaginians, and used by them in their wars with the Romans. The opinion,
too, is generally held that the elephants with which Hannibal crossed the
Alps were of the African species, as well as those which, after the
conquest of Carthage, were used in the Roman amphitheatres and military
pageants. On the other hand, it is well to remember that the late Mr. W.
Cotton Oswell, who had had great experience both with African and Asiatic
elephants, wrote as follows on this subject: "I believe some people suppose
the Carthaginians tamed and used the African elephant; they could hardly
have had mahouts Indian fashion, for there is no marked depression in the
nape of the neck for a seat, and the hemming of the ears when erected would
have half smothered them. My knowledge does not allow me to raise any
argument on this point; but might not the same market have been open to the
dwellers at Carthage as was afterwards to Mithridates, who, I suppose, drew
his supply from India? I know in the representations of elephants on the
medals of Faustina and of Septimus Severus the ears are African, though the
bodies and heads are Indian; but these were struck nearly 400 years after
Carthaginian times, when the whole known world had been ransacked by the
Romans for beasts for their public shows; and I still think it possible
that the Carthaginians--the great traders and colonisers of old--may have
obtained elephants through some of their colonies from India."

An interesting example of the intelligence of these animals can be seen any
day at the London Zoological Gardens. A large African elephant restores to
his would-be entertainers all the biscuits, whole or broken, which strike
the bars and fall alike out of his reach and theirs in the space between
the barrier and his cage. He points his trunk at the biscuits, and blows
them hard along the floor to the feet of the persons who have thrown them.
He clearly knows what he is doing, because, if the biscuits do not travel
far enough, he gives them a harder blow.

TAPIRS AND HYRAX.

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

TAPIRS are odd-looking creatures, and, strange as it may seem, are
nevertheless related on the one hand to the rhinoceroses, and on the other
to the horses. They are furthermore extremely interesting animals, because
they have undergone less modification of form than any other members of the
group to which they belong. This we know because fossil tapirs, belonging
to a very remote period of the world's history, are practically
indistinguishable from those now living.

The general form of the body may perhaps be described as pig-like; the
head, too, suggests that animal. But the pig's snout is here produced into
a short proboscis, or trunk. The feet are quite unlike those of the pig,
and resemble those of the rhinoceros. The fore feet have each four and the
hind feet three toes; these are all encased in large horse-like hoofs. The
tail is reduced to a mere stump.

Tapirs are shy and inoffensive animals, living in the seclusion of dense
forests in the neighbourhood of water, in which element they are quite at
home; indeed, it is said that they will frequently dive and walk along the
bed of the river. They are also fond of wallowing in mud, partly, it is
believed, that they may encase themselves with it as a protection against
the annoyance of flies. They feed on shoots of trees, bushes, leaves, and
fallen fruits, foraging during the evening, and possibly far into the
night.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

MALAYAN TAPIR.

The largest of all the tapirs. Is easily distinguished from the American
tapirs by the patch of white on the middle of its body.]

Tapirs are hunted by the natives for the sake of their thick hides, which
are cut into thongs for reins and bridles. The flesh also is esteemed by
some. There are three methods of capture. In South America the lasso is
used with occasional success. But when not foiled by undergrowth, the
hunter often loses his victim by reason of the violence and force of its
rush, which snaps the thong. The Gauchos intercept it with dogs on its way
to the water, when it will fight furiously, and many dogs may be killed
before its dispatch is accomplished. Others imitate its peculiar, shrill
call, and shoot it on its approach in answer thereto. Captives are easily
tamed, and may be seen walking about the streets in many South American
towns. They wander into the forest by day, returning in the evening to be
fed, and are said to display great affection. On account of their great
strength, it has been suggested that such captives should be used as beasts
of burden.

Except the MALAYAN TAPIR, which is black and white, tapirs are black or
dark brown in colour, and but scantily clothed with hair; but the young, it
is interesting to note, are spotted and striped with white or fawn-colour
on a dark ground, a coloration recalling that of the wild pig.

There are five different species of tapir. Their geographical distribution
is remarkable, four species being South American, and one belonging to the
Malayan region. But far back in the world's history, as we know from
fossils, tapirs roamed over the warm and temperate regions of Europe, and
their remains have been found in China and the United States. Thus the
intervening gaps existing to-day have been made by the extinction of these
intermediate species.

By nature the tapir appears to be a harmless and inoffensive animal, flying
even before the smallest dog. Occasionally, however, it displays great
courage and ferocity, and this appears to be especially the case with
females deprived of their young. At such times they will charge with great
spirit, and knock down, trample on, and bite their victim after the fashion
of wild swine.

Man alone excepted, the most deadly foe of the AMERICAN TAPIR is the
jaguar, as is the tiger of the Malay species. The American tapir often gets
rid of the jaguar by rushing at full speed into the dense jungle, thus
sweeping its assailant from its back, the jaguar's claws finding but an
insecure hold on its victim's thick hide. Tapirs are often found bearing
scars all over the back, witnessing the terrible nature of the wounds
received at such times.

That the tapir is a comparatively unknown animal is partly accounted for by
the fact that it is but little sought after by the big-game hunter--who
finds more excitement in pursuit of its larger relative the rhinoceros--and
partly, perhaps, owing to its inhabiting regions comparatively little
visited by Europeans. Nevertheless, the tapir is an animal of quite
peculiar interest, having undergone but little change during long ages,
whilst its ally the horse has effected in the same time a complete
transformation, not only in its general shape, but more especially in its
teeth and feet. The gradual steps by which this transformation has been
brought about we can trace through certain fossil forms, of which we can
say little here.

Amongst these fossils occur remains of an animal bearing a very strong
resemblance to the living tapir, but which, strangely enough, is not really
so closely related thereto as to the horses. It does not, however, stand in
the direct line of descent of these latter, but must be regarded as
representing a collateral branch thereof. The occurrence of this distinct
tapir-like animal is of great scientific interest.

The short, stout legs and spreading toes of the living tapirs,
rhinoceroses, and ancestral horse are admirably adapted for plodding
deliberately over soft and yielding ground, such as is afforded by
reed-beds and banks of rivers, or the shady depths of forests. Speed in
such surroundings is not necessary, food in plenty being always at hand,
and escape from enemies being sought by concealment in thick herbage rather
than flight. With a migration to drier and higher plains, the spreading
foot has undergone a change. The short legs and numerous toes have given
place to long ones, and of the several toes growth has taken place in one
only--the third; whilst the others have slowly dwindled, till eventually
only traces of the second and fourth remain, as in the modern horse. Thus
has a firmer support over hard, unyielding ground been brought about, and
great speed gained. The animals with this type of foot (in which the third
is the largest toe) are known as the Odd-toed Hoofed Animals. The pigs,
sheep, deer, and oxen have gained an equally efficient foot, yet retaining
four toes. Of these, the third and fourth are equal in size, and serve as a
support to the body, whilst the second and fifth have now become
functionless, and do not reach the ground. This type of foot characterises
that group of the hoofed animals known as the Even-toed.


THE HYRAX.

This is one of the most remarkable of living mammals, and one of the
greatest puzzles to zoologists, having no near living relatives. Though
bearing some resemblance to an earless rabbit, it really belongs to the
hoofed animals, and amongst them comes perhaps somewhat nearer the
rhinoceros than to any other animal. It is the CONEY of the Bible. It
inhabits the rocky districts of Syria and parts of Africa. It is a
vegetable-feeder, and very wary. About a dozen species are known.

COMMON AMERICAN TAPIR.

This tapir inhabits tropical America. It is a nocturnal animal, frequenting
the depths of shady forests in the neighbourhood of water, to which it
frequently resorts for the purpose of bathing, or as a refuge from
pursuit.]


THE RHINOCEROS.

BY F. C. SELOUS.

Of the five existing species of RHINOCEROS, three are found in Asia, whilst
two are inhabitants of Africa.

Of the three Asiatic species, two, the INDIAN and the JAVAN, are
one-horned, and have a single pair of broad incisor teeth in the upper jaw,
and a pair of sharp-edged and pointed tusks in the lower, the nasal bones
being long and narrow, and terminating in a point. In both these species
the skin is hairless (except for tufts or fringes at the extremity of the
tail and on the edges of the ears), and is arranged in shield-like folds
over the body. The arrangement of these folds, however, differs somewhat in
the two species, and the large round tubercles with which the skin of the
great Indian rhinoceros is profusely studded are wanting in the Javan
species.

The INDIAN RHINOCEROS inhabits the Terai at the foot of the Himalaya from
Bhutan to Nepal, and is said to be very abundant in Assam and the Bhutan
Dooars. It frequents swampy ground, and lives amongst jungles and dense
growths of reeds and grass, which attain a height sometimes of 20 feet, and
cover vast areas of ground in the valley of the Brahmaputra and other
rivers.

Owing to the nature of the country in which it lives, the Indian rhinoceros
cannot often be hunted with much prospect of success, except with the aid
of elephants, which sagacious animals are not only employed to carry the
hunters, but are also used to beat the great grass jungles in which the
rhinoceroses lie hidden, and drive them towards the guns.

Despite its great size and strength, the Indian rhinoceros seems to be
regarded as, in general, a timid and inoffensive animal, and even when
wounded it seldom charges home. Elephants, however, appear to be as a rule
nervous when in the near proximity of rhinoceroses, perhaps objecting to
the smell of those animals. When the Indian rhinoceros does make good its
charge against either man or elephant, it cuts and rips its enemy with its
teeth, and makes little use of its horn as an offensive weapon.

The Indian rhinoceros is said to live principally, if not entirely, on
grass and reeds. As a rule it is a solitary animal, but sometimes several
are found living in a comparatively small extent of grass-covered plain.

Large males of this species will stand from 5 feet 9 inches to 6 feet at
the shoulder, and they are enormously bulky. Both sexes carry
well-developed horns, which, however, do not usually attain a length of
upwards of 12 inches. There is a specimen in the British Museum measuring
19 inches, and it is believed that in very exceptional instances a length
of 2 feet has been attained.

The JAVAN RHINOCEROS, though it has been called the Lesser Indian
Rhinoceros, is said by a late authority--Mr. C. E. M. Russell--to stand
about the same height at the shoulder as the Indian species. It is found in
the Sunderbunds of Eastern Bengal, and has been met with in the Sikhim
Terai and in Assam, ranging eastwards through Burma and the Malay Peninsula
to Sumatra, Java, and Borneo.

But little appears to be known of the habits of this species of rhinoceros.
Although it is found in the swampy grass-covered plains of the Sunderbunds,
its more usual habitat seems to be hilly forest-covered country, and both
in Burma and Java it ascends to a height of several thousand feet above
sea-level. It feeds principally upon leaves and the young shoots of trees
and bushes. In disposition it is timid and inoffensive. Only the male
carries a horn, which, being very short, is a very poor trophy for a
sportsman.

The third Asiatic species of rhinoceros, known as the SUMATRAN, is the
smallest of all living rhinoceroses. This species carries two horns, and
its skin, which is very rough, is usually thinly covered with hair of a
dark brown colour and of considerable length. The folds in the skin of the
Sumatran rhinoceros are not nearly so well developed as in its
single-horned relatives, and the one behind the shoulders is alone
continued over the back. Although furnished with tusks in the lower jaw,
the small pair of incisor teeth, which in the other two Asiatic
rhinoceroses are always present in front of these tusks, are wanting in the
Sumatran species.

GREAT INDIAN RHINOCEROS.

This species inhabits the grass jungles of North-eastern India.]

The Sumatran rhinoceros is rare in Assam, but is found in Burma and the
Malay Peninsula, as well as in Siam, Sumatra, and Borneo. The two horns of
this species are placed at some distance apart. Although they are as a rule
very short, the front horn occasionally grows to a considerable length,
sweeping backwards in a graceful curve.

In height adult males of the Sumatran species stand on the average from 4
feet to 4½ feet at the shoulder, and females sometimes not more than 3 feet
8 inches.

Like the Javan rhinoceros, the Sumatran species is by preference an
inhabitant of hilly, forest-covered country, and browses on the leaves and
shoots of trees and bushes. It is a timid and inoffensive animal, soon
becoming tame in captivity. Its flesh is said to be much appreciated by the
Dyaks of Borneo; and as its horns are of value for export to China, where
they are used for medicinal purposes, it has of late years very much
decreased in numbers in the province of Sarawak, but is more plentiful in
Central and North Borneo. Living as it does in dense jungle, it is an
animal which is seldom seen by European sportsmen, and its habits in a wild
state have never been yet very closely studied.

Turning to the two species of rhinoceros which inhabit the continent of
Africa, both are double-horned, and neither furnished with incisor teeth,
the nasal bones being thick, rounded, and truncated in front. Both, too,
are smooth-skinned and entirely hairless, except on the edge of the ears
and extremity of the tail, which are fringed or tufted.

Of the two African species, the WHITE or SQUARE-MOUTHED RHINOCEROS is the
larger and the rarer. Until quite recently the range of this huge
ungainly-looking animal, the biggest of all terrestrial mammals after the
elephant, was supposed to be entirely confined to the southern portions of
the African Continent; for although from time to time horns had found their
way to Zanzibar which seemed referable to the square-mouthed rhinoceros,
the fact of the existence of the white rhinoceros in any part of Africa
north of the Zambesi remained in doubt until a female was shot in the year
1900, in the neighbourhood of Lado, on the Upper Nile, by Captain A. St. H.
Gibbons, who brought its skin, skull, and horns to England. The fact,
however, that the white rhinoceros has never been encountered by any other
traveller in Central Africa seems to show that the animal is either very
rare in those districts, or that it has an exceedingly limited range.

ONE OF THE SAME RHINOCEROSES DEAD.

This picture gives some idea of the size of the commonest surviving
species.]

In the early years of the nineteenth century the square-mouthed or white
rhinoceros was found in large numbers over the whole of South Africa from
the Orange River to the Zambesi, except in the waterless portions of the
Kalahari Desert, or those parts of the country which are covered with
rugged stony hills or dense jungle.

Speaking of his journey in 1837 through the western part of what is now the
Transvaal Colony, Captain (afterwards Sir) Cornwallis Harris wrote: "On our
way from the waggons to a hill not half a mile distant, we counted no less
than twenty-two of the white species of rhinoceros, and were compelled in
self-defence to slaughter four. On one occasion I was besieged in a bush by
three at once, and had no little difficulty in beating off the assailants."
Even so lately as thirty years ago the white rhinoceros was still to be met
with in fair numbers in Ovampoland and other districts of Western South
Africa, whilst it was quite plentiful in all the uninhabited parts of
Eastern South Africa from Zululand to the Zambesi. In 1872 and 1873, whilst
elephant-hunting in the uninhabited parts of Matabililand, I encountered
white rhinoceroses almost daily, and often saw several in one day. At the
present time, however, unless it should prove to be numerous in some as yet
unexplored districts of North Central Africa, this strange and interesting
animal must be counted one of the rarest of existing mammals, and in
Southern Africa I fear it must soon become extinct. A few still exist
amongst the wild loquat groves of Northern Mashonaland, and there are also
a few surviving in Zululand; but I fear that even with the most rigid
protection they are too few in number to restock the country. They have a
better chance, I think, of increasing in numbers in Zululand than in
Mashonaland, in which latter country it is at present impossible to afford
them any protection either from natives or Europeans.

RHINOCEROS BATHING.

All the Asiatic species of rhinoceros are fond of bathing and wallowing in
mud.]

A full-grown bull white rhinoceros stands from 6 feet 6 inches to 6 feet 9
inches at the shoulder, and is very massively built, with short, stout
legs. The head is very much elongated, and the mouth square, like that of
an ox. When white rhinoceroses were still plentiful, very considerable
differences were observable in the length and shape of their horns. The
anterior horns of full-grown bulls might measure from 18 inches to 40
inches in length; those of cows from 24 inches to 60 inches. The longest
horn known--that of a cow--which was brought from South Africa by the
well-known hunter the late Roualeyn Gordon Cumming, measures 62½ inches
over the curve. As a rule, the front horn of the white rhinoceros curved
slightly backwards, but was often straight or bent slightly forwards, and
sometimes curved strongly backwards. The posterior horn varied from a few
inches to 2 feet in length.

The white rhinoceros lived in families, usually a bull, cow, and calf being
found together; but there might be two or even three calves of different
ages, and of which the youngest alone would be suckling, living with the
father and mother. In the early South African spring (September and
October), when the young green herbage was just sprouting after the first
rains, two or three families of white rhinoceroses might be seen feeding in
close proximity, presenting the appearance of a herd; but I fancy the
several families of these animals had only been brought together for the
sake of the young green grass. In Southern Africa the white rhinoceros
lived entirely on grass, and I have never seen any evidence of their having
eaten anything else. When either walking, trotting, or galloping, the white
rhinoceros always carried its nose close to the ground. A calf always
preceded its mother, and she appeared to guide it by holding the point of
her horn on the little creature's rump; and in all changes of pace, no
matter how sudden, this position was always maintained. The white
rhinoceros was easily killed by a shot through the heart or through both
lungs, but would travel very long distances, and probably, as a rule,
ultimately recover from wounds in other parts of the body. They could
travel at a great rate and for a considerable distance with a broken fore
leg or shoulder, but if a hind leg were broken they were rendered almost
immediately helpless. In disposition they were sluggish and inoffensive
animals, lying asleep in the shade of trees or bushes during the heat of
the day, and coming to the water to drink at night or often before sundown
in parts of the country where they had not been much molested. When
disturbed, white rhinoceroses would go off at a swift trot, but if chased
on horseback would break into a gallop, which they were capable of
maintaining for a considerable distance, and at a wonderful pace for so
large and heavy an animal. The meat of the white rhinoceros was most
excellent, the part in greatest favour amongst hunters being the hump on
the back of the neck in front of the shoulder, which was cut off whole and
roasted in the skin in a hole dug in the ground.

The colour of the so-called white rhinoceros is dark grey. The second
species of African rhinoceros, which is also dark grey in colour, is known
as the BLACK or PREHENSILE-LIPPED RHINOCEROS.

Less than a hundred years ago the range of this fast-disappearing species
extended from the north-western districts of the Cape Colony to Abyssinia,
and at that time it must have been plentiful over almost the whole of the
intervening country. It never seems to have penetrated into the equatorial
forest regions of West Central Africa, where the climate is probably too
damp to suit its requirements; for both species of African rhinoceros
appear to like a dry climate, and not to object to very arid surroundings.
At the same time they never wander many miles from a river or pool, and
drink regularly every night, and in hot weather probably very often a
second time in the early morning.

In Southern Africa the black rhinoceros appears to attain to a larger size
than in the countries farther north. To the south of the Zambesi large
bulls of this species will stand 5 feet 8 inches at the shoulder; whilst
the height of an adult bull, as taken by Mr. F. Jackson at Naivasha, in
East Africa, was 5 feet 5 inches; and Mr. A. H. Neumann gives the standing
height of another adult bull shot by himself still farther north, near Lake
Rudolph, as only 4 feet 9 inches.

[Illustration: _Photo by Norman B. Smith, Esq._

BLACK AFRICAN RHINOCEROS.

This photograph, taken by a sportsman in Africa, shows a charging
rhinoceros just before it was shot.]

It is now generally recognised that there is but one species of
prehensile-lipped rhinoceros in Africa, though the horns, and especially
the hinder one, differ in length and shape to such an extent that it was
long thought that there were at least two distinct species, those with both
horns of equal or nearly equal length having been distinguished from the
more common form, with a comparatively short second horn, as the KEITLOA,
this being the name in the Sechuana dialect for a prehensile-lipped
rhinoceros with horns of equal length. Speaking on this subject, Mr. A. H.
Neumann, who has had great experience with the black rhinoceros in East
Africa, writes: "Length of horn is a purely fortuitous individual trait;
and the extremely long horns (mostly of females) which have occasionally
been obtained from traders on the east coast, and brought home, are merely
exceptionally fine specimens, selected from among large numbers brought to
the coast (the bulk of which, I am told, go to China to be ground up into
medicine), and do not belong to any distinct species, nor come from any
particular region. In proof of this contention I may mention that I have a
40-inch horn, the owner of which I myself shot at the northern base of the
Jambeni Range (near Kenia), in a neighbourhood where I hunted a great deal
and saw great numbers of rhinos, and shot a good many. The vast majority
have quite short horns--under a foot--and anything over 18 inches is
uncommon, while a length of 30 inches or upwards is extremely rare." The
black rhinoceros, I believe, never eats grass, but browses on the young
shoots of trees and bushes, which are often quite leafless and seem
excessively dry. In this way it chews up and swallows great quantities of
dry-looking twigs, much of which passes through its stomach undigested.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

SUMATRAN RHINOCEROS.

This species of rhinoceros is the smallest of the three Oriental forms. It
has two horns.]

There has been a good deal of controversy as to the character and
disposition of the black rhinoceros, some hunters and travellers regarding
it as most dangerous and aggressive, whilst others are inclined to take an
almost opposite view. That some black rhinoceroses are certainly aggressive
and therefore dangerous animals, the experiences of C. J. Anderson and W.
Cotton Oswell in South Africa many years ago, and of many travellers and
hunters in East Africa during the last few years, certainly prove beyond a
doubt; and as one never knows that any particular rhinoceros, when
encountered, may not prove to be a vicious brute, a certain amount of
caution should be employed in approaching one of these animals. In my own
experience I always found that black rhinoceroses ran off at once on
getting the wind of a human being; whilst, on the other hand, if they only
heard one approaching, they would come towards the noise, and I have often
known them to trot up to within twenty yards of where I was standing,
snorting and puffing loudly; but as these animals always turned round and
went off eventually without charging, I came to the conclusion that they
were inquisitive and very short-sighted rather than vicious. When fired
into, a black rhinoceros goes off at a gallop--his usual pace, when
alarmed, being a very fast trot--puffing and snorting loudly. He can gallop
at a very great pace, considering his size and weight; but a South African
shooting-pony can easily come up with him, or get away from him if pursued.
In death a black rhinoceros will often sink down on its knees, and remain
in that position, looking as if it were simply resting. When dying, it
often gives vent to a pitiful squeal, the sound seeming very small and thin
for so large a beast. The meat of the black rhinoceros is not
ill-flavoured, and, if fat, very palatable; but as a rule these animals are
very lean, and their flesh tough and coarse. The tongue, however, if well
cooked, is always good; and the liver, if first roasted under the ashes,
and then, after being beaten up in a native wooden mortar, cooked with rice
and fat, makes a dish which is good enough for a hungry man.

During the making of the Uganda Railway the engineers came upon something
like a preserve of this species of rhinoceros, especially in the thick and
waterless thorn jungle near the coast. The rhinoceros was almost the only
animal, except the lion, which was able to penetrate the bush. As many as
five of these animals were seen in one day when the line was being made;
they did no injury to the coolies, other than by frightening them, and
appeared to be stupid and by no means vigilant animals, perhaps because no
other creature attacked them. The lion never meddles with a grown-up
rhinoceros, though it might and probably does kill a calf occasionally,
when the latter is no larger than a full-grown pig. The horns of some of
these East African black rhinoceroses were of unusual length and thinness.

ZEBRAS AND WILD ASSES.

BY F. C. SELOUS.

----

ZEBRAS.

The Zebras have many points in common with the asses, from which latter
group of animals they are principally distinguished by their beautifully
striped skins. Both asses and zebras carry short, erect manes, and in both
the upper portion of the tail is free from long hair. In both groups there
are naked callosities on the fore legs only, whilst the head is larger in
proportion to the size of the animal, and the ears longer than in the
horse. In BURCHELL'S and GREVY'S ZEBRAS the hoof is intermediate between
that of the horse and the ass; for although narrower than the hoof of the
horse, it is broader and more rounded than that of the ass. In the TRUE
ZEBRA, however, the hoof is thoroughly asinine in character, and the ears
very long.

[Illustration: _Photo by G. W. Wilson & Co., Ltd._]     [_Aberdeen._

MOUNTAIN-ZEBRA.

The true or mountain zebra is now becoming scarcer than formerly. At one
time it was to be seen in great numbers on the mountains of Cape Colony.]

The TRUE or MOUNTAIN ZEBRA appears never to have had a very extended range.
It was once an inhabitant of all the mountainous regions of the Cape Colony
as well as of the great Drakensberg Range, and fifty years ago was also
found amongst the rugged hills of Great Namaqualand. The mountain-zebra is
the smallest of the group, standing only from 12 to 12½ hands at the
shoulder. It is a most beautiful animal, the whole of the head, body, and
limbs, with the exception of the under-parts and the insides of the thighs,
being striped. The ground-colour of the body is white, the stripes being
black and the muzzle bright brown. Both hind and fore legs are banded down
to the hoofs. The stripes on the neck and body are narrower and more
numerous than in Burchell's zebra, and on the hindquarters the median
stripe, which runs down the centre of the back from the mane to the tail,
is connected with the uppermost of the oblique longitudinal stripes by a
series of short horizontal bars. The ears in this species are much larger
than in Burchell's zebra.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

GREVY'S ZEBRA.

This species of zebra comes from the Galla country, and has narrower and
more numerous stripes than the mountain-zebra.]

The true zebra seems never to have been an inhabitant of the plains, like
all its congeners, but to have confined its range entirely to mountainous
districts. Speaking on this point, Captain (afterwards Sir) Cornwallis
Harris wrote upwards of sixty years ago: "This beautiful and wary animal
never of its own free will descends into the plain, as erroneously asserted
by all naturalists, and it therefore never herds with either of its
congeners, the quagga and Burchell's zebra, whose habitat is equally
limited to the open and level lowlands. Seeking the wildest and most
sequestered spots, the haughty troops are exceedingly difficult of
approach, as well on account of their watchful habits and extreme agility
and fleetness of foot, as from the abrupt and inaccessible nature of their
highland abode."

An allied species, of which examples have been obtained by Mr. G. W.
Penrice, occurs in Benguela, Portuguese West Africa.

I once saw the carcase of a zebra stallion which had been sent by rail to
the Cape Town Museum by a farmer living in the neighbourhood of the village
of Worcester. This animal had come down from the mountains, and joined a
troop of donkeys running on the farm. Its intrusion was, however, resented
by a male donkey, which fought with and overpowered it, and, having seized
it with its teeth by the back of the neck, held it fast until it was
secured by the farmer and his men. The captured animal, however, refused
food, and soon died, when its carcase was sent to the Cape Museum for
preservation.

GREVY'S ZEBRA is the largest and perhaps the handsomest of all the zebras.
This fine animal is an inhabitant of Eastern Africa, its range extending
from the central portion of Somaliland southwards to the Tana River. It
appears to be plentiful in the country between Mount Kenia and Lake
Rudolph, but has not, I believe, been met with to the west of that lake.
Full-grown specimens of Grevy's zebra will stand from 14½ to 15 hands at
the shoulder, with a girth of body immediately behind the shoulders of
nearly 5 feet. The arrangement of the stripes in this species differs
considerably both from that of the mountain-zebra of the Cape Colony and
also from Burchell's zebra. The body-stripes are very narrow, numerous, and
deep black in colour, and are separated by equally narrow white bands. The
longitudinal stripes on the haunches are also shorter and finer than in any
other species of zebra, and on the top of the quarters there is a white
unstriped space on each side of the median line which runs down the centre
of the back from the neck to the tail. The belly and insides of the thighs
are white, and the legs banded right down to the hoofs as in the
mountain-zebra, and the ears are as large as in that species.

[Illustration: _Photo by Percy Ashenden._

BURCHELL'S ZEBRA AT HOME.

This excellent photograph was taken in South Africa, and shows these
animals in their native state.]

Grevy's zebra is, as a rule, an inhabitant of open or thinly wooded
country, and it appears to avoid anything in the nature of thick cover. In
Central Somaliland Major Swayne met with it on low plateaux some 2,500 feet
above sea-level, the sides of which fell in broken ravines to the
river-valleys. This country is described as broken and hilly, and here
Grevy's zebras were met with in small droves of about half a dozen. In the
country between Mount Kenia and Lake Rudolph, Mr. A. H. Neumann frequently
met with herds of Grevy's and Burchell's zebras consorting together. The
contrast between the two species when thus seen side by side was very
marked, the former animals looking like horses among a flock of ponies. Mr.
Neumann never observed stallions of the two species fighting together, but
on the other hand he states that the stallions of the larger species fight
viciously amongst themselves for possession of the mares. Grevy's zebras
seem never to collect in large herds, more than twenty, or at the outside
thirty, being very seldom seen together.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

THE HON. WALTER ROTHSCHILD'S TEAM OF ZEBRAS.

Mr. Rothschild was practically the first Englishman to break in zebras to
harness. At one time these animals were thought to be quite untamable.]

Although this species is an inhabitant of arid plains and bare stony hills
where the herbage is short, it requires to drink daily, and is never
therefore found at any great distance from water.

The cry of Grevy's zebra is stated to be quite different from that of
Burchell's. Mr. Neumann describes it as a very hoarse kind of grunt, varied
by something approaching to a whistle, the grunts being long drawn out, and
divided by the shrill whistling sound, as if the latter were made by
drawing in the breath which had been expelled during the sustained grunt.

Like all other species of the genus to which they belong, Grevy's zebras,
especially the mares when in foal, become very fat at certain seasons of
the year, and their flesh is much appreciated both by natives and lions,
the latter preying on them and their smaller congeners, Burchell's zebras,
in preference to any other animal, now that the rinderpest has almost
exterminated the great herds of buffalo which once roamed in countless
numbers all over East Central Africa.

BURCHELL'S ZEBRA once inhabited the whole of South-western, South-eastern,
Central, and Eastern Africa from the Orange River to Lake Rudolph; and
though it has long ceased to exist in the more southerly portions of its
range, it is still the most numerous and the best known of all the species
of zebra.

[Illustration: _Photo by Charles Reid, Wishaw, N.B._

HIGHLAND CATTLE.

These magnificent cattle are bred in large numbers in the Scottish
Highlands, whence they are brought to the richer pastures of England to
fatten for the market.]

The typical form of this species was first met with early last century by
Dr. Burchell in Southern Bechuanaland. In this form the legs are white
below the knees and hocks, and the body-stripes do not join the median
stripe of the belly. In examples met with farther north the legs are
striped down to the hoofs and the body-stripes join the belly-stripe. South
of the Zambesi all forms of Burchell's zebra seem to have faint markings,
known as shadow-stripes, on the pale yellow ground-colour of the spaces
between the broad black stripes. North of the Zambesi varieties are met
with in which these shadow-stripes are wanting. As, however, the
differences between all the various sub-species of Burchell's zebra are
superficial and not structural, and as, moreover, the habits of these
animals seem to be the same in every part of their widely extended range, I
shall henceforth speak of them as one species.

Burchell's zebra is without the small horizontal bars on the hindquarters,
which in the mountain-zebra connect the dorsal stripe with the uppermost of
the broad longitudinal bands running across the flanks. Its ears, too, are
smaller than in the latter species, and its mane fuller. In size Burchell's
zebra is intermediate between the mountain-zebra and Grevy's zebra,
standing from thirteen to thirteen and a half hands at the shoulder.

[Illustration: _By permission of Mr. William Cross_]     [_Liverpool._

BURCHELL'S ZEBRA, CHAPMAN'S VARIETY.

This zebra is one of several trained in Mr. Cross's well-known
establishment at Liverpool. Mr. Cross has been very successful in breaking
in zebras, and is frequently to be seen driving a pair about Liverpool.]

Where they have not been shot down, Burchell's zebras often live in large
herds of from fifty to over a hundred together. I have met with them almost
at the level of the sea, as in the Pungwe district of South-east Africa,
and all over the high plateaux of the interior up to a height of 5,000 feet
above sea-level. They are partial to sparsely forested country intersected
by open glades, but also frequent open plains entirely devoid of trees or
bush, having been once numerous on the open downs of the Western Transvaal
and Orange River Colony. They never live in dense jungle, but I have met
with them frequently amongst broken rugged hills. Burchell's zebras are
both fleet and enduring, but I have often galloped right amongst a herd of
them when mounted on a fast horse, and in good ground. In broken, hilly,
and stony ground, however, no horse can live with a Burchell's zebra. The
hoofs of this species seem made for running in rocky ground, being deeply
hollowed and as hard as iron.

I have always found the presence of Burchell's zebras a sure indication
that water was not far distant, and it is my experience that these animals
require to drink daily, and never wander more than a few miles away from
the pool or river they frequent.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

MARE AND FOAL OF BURCHELL'S ZEBRA.

These animals breed regularly in captivity.]

This species of zebra may often be seen in Southern Africa in company with
other animals, such as buffaloes, blue wildebeests, elands, gemsbucks, roan
and sassaby antelopes, and ostriches, and I have upon several occasions
seen them come up to domestic cattle and horses. They are naturally not
very wary, and in parts of the country where they have not been much
molested are often very inquisitive, and will come trotting quite close up
to a caravan, provided they do not get the scent of human beings. Foals of
this species are easily caught, and become at once very tame and confiding;
nor do I believe that adult Burchell's zebras are such vicious animals as
is generally supposed, since I have seen several which were very quiet and
well broken, whilst even the half-broken animals, which were at one time
used on one of the coach-lines in the Transvaal, did not appear very
vicious.

As with Grevy's zebra, the flesh of the species under consideration is much
appreciated both by natives and lions. I have often seen the fat on the
quarters of the mares quite an inch thick. It is of a dark yellow colour,
and too rich to suit the stomach of a European. The meat is rather sweet in
taste, but if fried with bacon not at all unpalatable.

[Illustration: _Photo by Norman B. Smith, Esq._

BURCHELL'S ZEBRA.

This species is occasionally domesticated and driven in South Africa, as it
is not injured by the tsetse fly.]

Professor Ewart has lately carried out a very interesting series of
experiments on the hybridising of zebras and horses. The results were very
satisfactory. The zebra cross proved to be very hardy creatures, capable of
wintering in the open on the hills of Scotland. The scientific data
obtained were of singular value, as showing the effect of crossbreeding on
subsequent generations of foals of the same mother. It has long been
believed that the influence of the first sire was seen in foals of which
other animals were subsequently the fathers. Thus, if a white mare threw a
foal to a black stallion, it was considered that her subsequent progeny
would occasionally be black, and instances were freely quoted to support
this theory. The scientific name of "telegony" was given to this supposed
influence of previous sires on future offspring. Professor Ewart's
experiments, in which pony mares were first mated with a zebra and
afterwards with horses, show that this theory of telegony is erroneous. The
foals sired afterwards by ponies and horses showed no trace whatever of
zebra stripes, but were normal pony foals, and not altered either in shape
or disposition.

The QUAGGA, which became extinct about thirty years ago, never had a very
extended range, but in the early part of the last century it existed in
great numbers on all the upland plains of the Cape Colony to the west of
the Kei River, and in the open treeless country lying between the Orange
and Vaal Rivers. North of the Vaal it appears to have been unknown.

QUAGGA.

This is, we believe, the only known photograph from life of this very rare
animal. There will probably never be another, for the quagga is generally
supposed to be extinct.]

The quagga seems to have been nearly allied to Burchell's zebra--especially
to the most southerly form of that species--but was much darker in general
colour, being of a dark rufous brown on the neck and upper-parts of the
body, becoming lighter on the sides, and fading off to white beneath and
behind. Instead of being striped, too, over the whole body, it was only
strongly banded on the head and neck, the dark brown stripes becoming
fainter on the shoulders and dying away in spots and blotches. On the other
hand, in size and build, in the appearance of its mane, ears, and tail, and
in general habits, it seems to have nearly resembled its handsomer
relative. The barking neigh "qu[=a]-h[=a]-h[=a], qu[=a]-h[=a]-h[=a]" seems,
too, to have been the same in both species. The word "quagga" is pronounced
in South Africa "qu[=a]-h[=a]," and is of Hottentot origin, being an
imitation of the animal's neighing call. To-day Burchell's zebras are
invariably called Qu[=a]-h[=a]s by both Boers and British colonists.


WILD ASSES.

The true asses are without stripes on the head, neck, and body, with the
exception of a dark streak down the back from the mane to the tail, which
is present in all members of the group, and in some cases a dark band
across the shoulders and irregular markings on the legs.

In Africa the wild ass is only found in the desert regions of the
north-eastern portion of that continent, being an inhabitant of Abyssinia,
Somaliland, Gallaland, the Soudan, and the arid districts bordering the Red
Sea. The form of wild ass found in Somaliland differs in some respects from
its near relative of the Nubian Desert, in that it is of a paler colour,
has the dorsal stripe but faintly marked, and is without a cross stripe
over the shoulders, whilst on the other hand it has numerous markings both
on the front and hind legs. Naturalists are, however, agreed that, although
there may be certain small differences in the colour and markings of the
wild asses found in different localities of Northern Africa, such
variations are of no specific value, and only one species is recognised.

The AFRICAN WILD ASS is a fine animal, standing between 13 and 14 hands at
the shoulder. It lives in small herds or families of four or five
individuals, and is not found in mountainous districts, but frequents low
stony hills and arid desert-wastes. It is as a general rule an alert animal
and difficult to approach, and so fleet and enduring that, excepting in the
case of foals and mares heavy in young, it cannot be overtaken even by a
well-mounted horseman. Notwithstanding the scanty nature of the herbage in
the districts they frequent, these desert-bred asses are always in good
condition. They travel long distances to water at night, but appear to
require to drink regularly. Their flesh is eaten by the natives of the
Soudan. The bray of the African wild ass is said to be indistinguishable
from that of the domesticated animal, which latter is undoubtedly descended
from the wild African breed.

In Asia three varieties of the wild ass are found, which were formerly
believed to represent three distinct species; but since the points of
difference between these varying forms do not appear to be of specific
value, all the local races of the Asiatic wild ass are now considered to
belong to one species.

These wild asses have a wide range, and are met with in the deserts of Asia
from Syria to Persia and Western India, and northwards throughout the more
arid portions of Central Asia.

In Tibet and Mongolia the wild ass inhabits the high mountain-plateaux, and
lives at elevations of 14,000 feet and upwards above the sea. This local
race, known as the KIANG, approaches in size to the African wild ass,
standing 13 hands at the shoulder. It is dark reddish brown in colour, with
a very narrow dorsal stripe. The ONAGER of Western India and Baluchistan is
a smaller and lighter-coloured animal, with a broader stripe down the back.
In parts of its range it is found at sea-level. In Persia and Syria a third
local race of wild ass is found, which, however, differs from the two forms
already enumerated in no essential particular.

Like their African congeners, the wild asses of Asia are inhabitants of the
waste places of the earth, frequenting desert plains and wind-swept
steppes. They are said to be so fleet and enduring that, except in the case
of a mare heavy with foal, they cannot be overtaken by a single horseman.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

BALUCHI WILD ASS.

This is one of the three leading varieties of the Asiatic wild ass. It is
found in Western India and Baluchistan.]

The wild asses of the desert plains of India and Persia are said to be very
wary and difficult to approach, but the kiang of Tibet is always spoken of
as a much more confiding animal, its curiosity being so great that it will
frequently approach to within a short distance of any unfamiliar object,
such as a sportsman engaged in stalking other game.

Asiatic wild asses usually live in small families of four or five, but
sometimes congregate in herds. Their food consists of various grasses in
the low-lying portions of their range, but of woody plants on the high
mountain-plateaux, where little else is to be obtained. Of wild asses in
general the late Sir Samuel Baker once said: "Those who have seen donkeys
only in their civilised state can have no conception of the wild or
original animal; it is the perfection of activity and courage."

The kiang comes from the Tibetan highlands. It is the largest and most

DOMESTICATED HORSE, ASSES, AND MULES.

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

----

THE DOMESTICATED HORSE.

Like the wild camels, genuine wild horses are very generally believed to be
extinct. The vast herds which occur to-day in a wild state in Europe,
America, and Australia are to be regarded, say those who believe in the
extinction theory, as descended from domesticated animals which have run
wild. So far as the American and Australian horses are concerned, this is
no doubt true; but of the European stocks it is by no means so certain. For
Dr. Nehring--and he speaks with authority--assures us that the wild horses
known as TARPANS, which occur on the steppes north of the Sea of Azoff,
between the river Dnieper and the Caspian, are veritable wild horses, the
last remaining members of enormous herds which occurred in Europe before
the dawn of civilisation. These horses formed no small part of the food of
the savage races of men then inhabiting this continent. This we know
because of the quantities of their remains found in the caves of the south
of France, for instance, associated with the remains of the men who hunted
them. Further evidence of this we have in the shape of crude engravings on
pieces of bone and deer horns, carved by the more artistic spirits amongst
these early hunters. From these drawings we gather that the horse they
hunted was small in size and heavy in build, with a large head and rough,
shaggy mane and tail--a horse, in fact, almost identical with the
above-mentioned tarpan. But long before historic records begin these horses
must have been domesticated; man discovered that they could be even more
useful alive than dead, and from that time forth the horse became his
inseparable companion. "Cæsar found the Ancient Britons and Germans using
war-chariots drawn by horses."

But the stock of domestic horses drawn from this tarpan breed appears to
have died out almost entirely, the majority of horses now existing being
probably descendants of the native wild horses of Asia, the product of a
still earlier domestication. In Egypt the horse, as a domestic animal,
seems to have been preceded by the ass; but about 1900 B.C. it begins to
appear in the rôle of a war-horse, to draw chariots. Its use, indeed, until
the Middle Ages was almost universally as a war-horse.

From the time of its domestication till to-day the history of the horse has
been one of progress. The care and forethought of the breeder have produced
many varieties, resulting in such extremes as the London Dray-horse, the
Racer, and the Shetland Pony.

YEARLING ARAB COLTS.

Note the colts examining the photographer's bag. They are very inquisitive
creatures, but easily frightened.]

The coloration of our various breeds of horses is generally without any
definite marking, piebald and dappled being the nearest approach to a
pattern. Occasionally, however, horses are found with a dark stripe along
the back, and sometimes with dark stripes on the shoulders and legs.
Darwin, discovering a number of horses so marked belonging to different
breeds, came to the conclusion that probably all existing races of horses
were descended from a "single dun-coloured, more or less striped primitive
stock, to which [stock] our horses occasionally revert."

"If we were not so habituated to the sight of the horse," says the late Sir
William Flower, "as hardly ever to consider its structure, we should
greatly marvel at being told of a mammal so strangely constructed that it
had but a single toe on each extremity, on the end of the nail of which it
walked or galloped. Such a conformation is without parallel in the
vertebrate series." By the aid of fossils we can trace out all the stages
through which this wonderful foot has passed in arriving at its present
state of perfection: we can see how it has become more and more beautifully
adapted to fulfil the requirement demanded--a firm support to enable its
owner to cover hard ground at great speed. The study of the structure of
this foot, and a comparison with the intermediate forms, make it clear that
this toe corresponds to the third finger or toe of the human hand or
foot--according as we compare the fore or hind limbs--and that its
development was at the expense of the remaining toes, which gradually
dwindled and disappeared, leaving in the living one-toed horse only traces
of the second and fourth toes in the shape of a pair of splint-bones, one
on either side of the excessively developed third toe.

ARAB MARE.

Nothing would induce this horse to stand still in order to be photographed;
so as a last resource Lady Anne Blunt put on her Arab costume. This acted
like magic, for under its spell the animal at once became quiet.]

The horses, it must be remarked, may be distinguished from the asses by the
fact that the tail in the former is clothed with long hair throughout; in
the latter long hair springs only from the sides and end, forming a tuft.
Furthermore, the horses have a remarkable horny excrescence, resembling a
huge black and flattened wart, on each hind leg just below the "hock," or
heel-joint. This excrescence is commonly known as the "chestnut." Its
function is unknown. A similar pair of "chestnuts" occurs on the inner side
of the fore limb just above the wrist, or "knee," as it is generally
called. The "chestnuts" of the fore limb occur also in the asses, but not
those of the hind limb.

ARAB MARES AND FOALS.

A pretty group of some of Lady Anne Blunt's famous Arabs.]


THE ARAB HORSE.

This magnificent and justly celebrated animal is chosen first for
consideration because it is probably a direct descendant of an original
wild breed--the Asiatic wild horse. How far back the domestication of this
breed began will probably never be exactly known. Till the third century
after Christ the Arabs were almost certainly camel-riders; but by the sixth
century of our era we find them in possession of a breed of horses which
they regarded with great reverence, and spoke of as an heritage from their
forefathers. They were probably introduced from the Caucasus or Asia Minor.
The Arab horse found its way into Europe, perhaps accompanied by an allied
breed--the Barb--with the Arab invasion of Spain in the eighth and ninth
centuries, leaving traces of its sojourn in the Andalusian and the French
Limousin. But the great value of Arab blood was not appreciated till armour
ceased to be used, the excessive weight of this demanding a horse of heavy
build.

The Arab does not appear to have been introduced into England till the
seventeenth century; but the result of that introduction, as we shall see
presently, has been fraught with tremendous consequences. In its native
land it appears to have been bred chiefly for the purposes of warfare. The
success with which the breeders' judicious selection has been rewarded is
plainly seen in the wonderful powers of endurance on long marches; so that,
at the end of a raid, the animal is still fresh enough either for flight,
if necessary, or for a final rush on a retreating enemy. Besides, Arabs
possess great courage, and are frugal both in the matter of food and drink.

As a race-horse, one enthusiast assures us, the Arab is superior to every
other natural breed; he is beaten only by his own half-breed offspring--the
English Race-horse. But this seems to be rather an over-estimate.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

PERCHERON HORSE.

A Continental breed. This horse is believed to be the only one of its kind
in England.]

The colour of the Arab varies; white is the most highly esteemed, but bay
and chestnut are common, black being rare. Strange as it may seem, the
white breed is never born white.

HACKNEY AND FOAL.

A specimen of the English carriage-horse.]

The great affection of the Arab for his horse is proverbial. The following
story is certainly worth repeating: "The whole stock of an Arab of the
desert consisted of a mare. The French Consul offered to purchase her, in
order to send her to his sovereign, Louis XIV. The Arab would have rejected
the proposal; but being miserably poor, with scarcely a rag to cover him,
his wife and children starving, he was tempted greatly. At length he
yielded. He brought the mare to the consul's house, and stood leaning on
her neck, and looking, now at the gold, and now at the horse. The gold was
good to look upon; it would make him rich for life. Turning at last to his
favourite, he said: 'To whom is it I am going to yield thee up? To
Europeans, who will tie thee close, who will beat thee, who will make thee
miserable. Return with me, my beauty, my jewel, and rejoice the hearts of
my children.' At the last of these words he sprang upon her back, and was
in a few moments out of sight."


THE BARB.

This is an African breed, which, like the generality of African horses, is
distinguished from those of Asia by its long limbs and small girth at the
loins, thus resembling the foals of other breeds. It displays great powers
of enduring hunger and thirst; and is fleet, with a high and graceful
action. The barb takes its name from its native land--Barbary. It is a
larger breed than the Arab.

LADAS.

LEVANT AND PERSIAN HORSES.

These are very closely allied to the Arab, but generally of larger size;
and in Southern Persia, at least, less delicately framed. The Turkoman
horses are related to those of Northern Persia.


THE ENGLISH RACE-HORSE.

This animal is the product of very careful selection and gradual
improvement of an original native breed, extending over several centuries.
Long since, so long ago as the reign of James I., it had reached a high
degree of excellence.

Upon this native stock there has been built up, by the infusion of Arab
blood, the swiftest horse which the world has ever known--the BRITISH
THOROUGHBRED. "Of this breed, it may be stated," says Mr. Allison, "that
every such animal in the stud-book of the present day, in this country or
any other, descends ... from one of three original Eastern sires--the
Darley Arabian, the Byerley Turk, or the Godolphin Arabian." This is an
extremely interesting fact, and constitutes a lasting monument to the
enterprise and acumen of the British horse-breeder.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

FLORIZEL II.

One of the King's racing-stud.]

The Byerley Turk hailed from the Levant, and was introduced by Captain
Byerley about 1689. From the Byerley Turk came Herod, the most celebrated
of his descendants, who has given rise to the Herod line, which to-day is
but feebly represented.

The Godolphin Arabian, or the Godolphin Barb, was born about 1724. From his
grandson Matchem is derived the Matchem line, which is also to-day
bordering on extinction.

The Darley Arabian carries us back to the reign of Queen Anne. Flying
Childers and Bartlett's Childers are directly descended from him; and from
the latter is descended Eclipse, the fastest horse which the turf has ever
known. It is interesting to note that the descendants in the Eclipse line
enormously outnumber those of the other two lines which we have considered.
Of his descendants, one of the most illustrious is Stockwell, who has been
described as the most extraordinary sire of all time, whose blood is coming
more than ever to the front.

SHETLAND PONY AND FOAL.

These ponies belong to Lady Mary Hope and her sister, who have been very
successful in breeding them.]


THE TROTTING-HORSE.

This is an American breed. The trotting-horse is a combination of barb and
Arab on an English stock. Most of the trotting- and pacing-horses of
America may be traced to an English thoroughbred--Messenger--who was
imported into America in 1780. This horse became the founder of the
greatest trotting family in the world. The speed attained by some of the
fastest trotters is wonderful, a mile being covered in some three or four
seconds over two minutes.

Russia is the only European country with a distinct breed of trotter--the
ORLOFF. This breed was made by crossing Arab and English horses with the
native races. The Orloff has not the speed of the American horse, but has
greater powers of endurance. The trotting-season in Russia is winter, the
races taking place on the ice.

CHAMPION SHIRE STALLION.

One of Sir Walter Gilbey's celebrated cart-horses.]

The PACER is not a distinct breed, but so called on account of its curious
method of trotting. In trotting the left fore and right hind leg strike the
ground at the same moment; in pacing the fore and hind leg of the _same
side_ move in unison. Some wild animals--as the giraffe--are pacers. "Many
American horses," says Mr. Winans, "are able to move with either action, a
set of lighter shoes often sufficing to convert a trotter into a pacer."
Pacing is a swifter mode of motion than trotting. The record time stands at
one mile in 1 minute 39½ seconds, as again the trotting record of one mile
in 2 minutes 3¾ seconds.

POLO-PONY.

Various breeds of ponies are used in this game, but the most esteemed at
the present day are the English-bred New Forest, Dartmoor, or Exmoor, or
Welsh ponies.]


THE HUNTER.

This also is not a distinct breed, as some suppose. Any good riding-horse
may be used as a hunter. "Hunters" have been made by infusing the blood of
the race-horse with native breeds. The chief requirements are a muscular
neck and chest, with a rather short body, and shorter and stouter legs than
the race-horse.

From the half-bred hunter we pass by insensible gradation to the ordinary
saddle- and carriage-horses. The ideal carriage-horse, however, is more of
a distinct breed than the hunter, and known as the CLEVELAND BAY. It has
been produced by mingling the blood of the thoroughbred with that of a
horse of stouter make than that of the hunter type.

The record broad jump for the hunter, we might mention in passing, is
variously stated to be from 33 to 37 feet!

DONKEY.

This is a typical English coster's donkey, and won the first prize at the
Southwark Show.]


THE SHETLAND PONY.

This is a native of the Shetland Islands, and remarkable for its small
size, docility, and hardihood. It is allowed to run nearly wild, and made
to forage almost entirely for itself. In the winter it grows a coat of
great length, which, soon becoming matted, forms a most effective
protection against cold and wet. The DARTMOOR, EXMOOR, and NEW FOREST are
likewise small breeds, but lack the symmetry and beauty of the Shetland.


CART-HORSES.

Under this head are included all the large, heavily built draught-horses.
These are of European origin, and without intermixture of foreign--Asiatic
or African--blood. In England the most important breeds are the BLACK or
SHIRE HORSE, the CLYDESDALE, and the SUFFOLK PUNCH. These are wonderful
instances of the results of selective breeding towards a definite
end--large size, accompanied by great physical strength and powers of
endurance. To accomplish this, speed has had to be sacrificed.

ASSES AND MULES.

ASSES.

The DOMESTIC ASS, so common to-day in these islands, is of African origin,
and has, moreover, departed but little in either form or colour from the
wild race. This is probably due to the fact that the ass has not been
subjected in this country to that process of rigorous and careful selection
that the horse has undergone.

We have no record of its first introduction to these islands, but it was
certainly known in the reign of Ethelred, though it was a rare animal.
Later it appears to have died out, and to have been reintroduced in the
reign of Elizabeth; but it has never become popular. This is unfortunate;
its sterling qualities have never been really appreciated by us. Spain,
Italy, and Malta have all succeeded in raising some fine breeds. The United
States has, however, produced the finest of all in animals standing some 15
or 16 hands (5 feet or 5 feet 4 inches) high.


MULES.

The term MULE, strictly speaking, should be reserved for the offspring of
the male ass and the mare: the offspring of the opposite cross is called
the HINNY. Mules are valued on account of their great powers of endurance
and their sure-footedness. The finest and handsomest are bred in Spain, the
United States, and North-west India.

It is interesting to note that mules exhibit a strong tendency to revert to
the dun-coloured and striped coloration believed to belong to the primitive
horses. The spinal and shoulder stripes which sometimes appear in horses,
and more frequently in asses, occur yet more frequently in mules. The legs
of the mules appear particularly liable to revert to this striped
coloration in the United States, it is said nine out of ten being so
marked.

CHAPTER XIII.

_THE HOLLOW-HORNED RUMINANTS: OXEN, BISON, BUFFALOES, AND MUSK-OX._

Cattle, Deer, Camels, Pigs, Horses, Tapirs, Rhinoceroses, and Elephants
differ greatly in structure from the orders already described. They are
classed as the Ungulates, or Hoofed Mammals. In most of these, such as the
Horse, Deer, and Oxen, the toes are contained within a solid hoof; in
others, such as the Rhinoceros, they are protected by broad nails. Great
differences exist in the feet of the various groups of Ungulates, caused by
the degree in which the digits, or "toes," remain in use or not. Except in
the Elephant, where there are five, the greatest number of "working" digits
found in existing forms is four. In the Horse and its surviving allies the
digits are reduced to one; in the Giraffes, to two.

The general process, as it can be learnt from the remains of the horse-like
animals of the past, seems to have been as follows. One or more of the toes
were developed in length and strength at the expense of the others, until,
in the case of the Horse, only one toe remained, which was enclosed in a
large and solid hoof, little splints on either side of the cannon-bone
being left to hint where the second and fourth toes had once been. In the
Oxen and Deer the third and fourth toes developed equally, at the expense
of the others, and each gained a case or covering, which makes the two
parts of the "cloven hoof" of these groups.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

ENGLISH PARK-CATTLE.

This photograph represents two animals of different types. The bull (on the
right) is from Earl Ferrers' herd at Chartley Castle; the cow is a
cross-bred.]

The first group of the order of Ungulates is represented by the
Hollow-horned Ruminants. These have horns set on a core of bone, the horns
themselves being hollow throughout. They "chew the cud," after receiving
the food eaten into the first of four divisions in the stomach, whence it
is brought up into the mouth, and then swallowed again for digestion. The
Oxen, Sheep, and Goats have no popular name by which they are collectively
distinguished, but their characteristics are sufficiently well known. The
horns are never shed annually, as is the case with the Deer; and the hoofs
are cloven. They have no incisor teeth in the upper jaw, a characteristic
also shared by the Giraffes, the Prongbuck (or American antelope), and the
Deer. The lower jaw has its full complement of incisor teeth.

The Oxen and the allied Bison, Yak, and Buffaloes are the bulkiest and most
important to man of all ruminants. Some are found in nearly all inhabited
parts of the Old World, and there is one North American species, now
practically exterminated as a wild animal.

CALF OF ENGLISH PARK-CATTLE.

Though the stock is very old and inbred, the white park-cattle are still
fairly prolific.]


BRITISH PARK-CATTLE, AND THE AUROCHS.

The so-called "WILD CATTLE" found in the parks of Chillingham and Chartley,
as well as in Lord Leigh's park at Lyme, and in that of the Duke of
Hamilton at Cadzow Castle, Scotland, are probably not the descendants of an
indigenous wild race. It is not without reluctance that the belief in their
wild descent has been abandoned. But the evidence seems fairly conclusive
as to the antiquity of these white cattle, regarded as a primitive breed,
and of the unlikelihood of their being survivors of a truly wild stock.
They are almost identical in many points with the best breeds of modern
cattle, and probably represent the finest type possessed by the ancient
inhabitants of these islands. But they are far smaller than the original
WILD OX, or AUROCHS, the ancestor of our domestic breeds. The skulls of
these large wild oxen, which still survived in the Black Forest in Cæsar's
time, have been dug up in many parts of England, especially in the Thames
Valley, and may be seen at the Natural History Museum. The remains of the
extinct wild ox, the _Bos urus_ of the Romans, show that, if not so large
as an elephant, as Cæsar heard, its size was gigantic, reckoned by any
modern cattle standard whatever. It probably stood 6 feet high at the
shoulder, and there is every reason to believe that it was the progenitor
of the modern race of domestic cattle in Europe. It seems certain that the
Chartley Park herd did once run wild in Needwood Forest; but so do the
Italian buffaloes in the Maremma, and the Spanish bulls on the plains of
Andalusia. Those at Chartley have been kept in the park, which is very wild
and remote, so long that they have gradually lost many of the attributes of
domestication. This is even more marked in the case of Lord Tankerville's
white cattle at Chillingham. An observant visitor to Chillingham lately
noted that the bulls fight for the possession of the cows, and that one is
occasionally killed in these combats. The cows still "stampede" with their
calves when alarmed, and hide them for a week or ten days after they are
born. The horns of the Chillingham cattle turn up; those of the bulls of
the Chartley herd are straight or slightly inclined downwards. Crossbreds
between the Chartley cattle and some other herds of reputed ancient descent
may generally be seen at the Zoological Gardens. They remain remarkably
true to type.

JERSEY COW.

The property of Lord Braybrooke. Though small in size, the Jersey cows
produce more butter than any English breed.]

Formerly there were several other herds of ancient white cattle. One was at
Gisburne, in Yorkshire; another at Chatelherault Park, in Lanarkshire; and
records of herds at Bishop Auckland in Durham, Barnard Castle, Blair Athol,
Burton Constable, Naworth Castle, and other ancient parks are preserved.
Probably all were of a breed highly prized in ancient days, which was
allowed the run of the forests adjacent to the homes of their owners; then,
as the forests were cleared, they were gradually taken up and enclosed in
parks. Another theory is, that they were the white cattle of North-western
Italy, imported by the first settlements of Italian monks after the
conversion of the Saxons.


SOME DOMESTICATED CATTLE.

The various species of European domestic cattle have in most cases been
brought to a degree of excellence even higher than that which might be
expected from the long period of time in which their improvement has been
an object of solicitude to man. Of the foreign races, the dark red cattle
of the Spanish Peninsula--animals which have been exported to the Canary
Islands and Madeira with great success--are justly famous. The white oxen
of North-east Italy have been famous since the days of the Romans. The tall
long-horned cattle of Hungary are excellent alike as beasts of draught and
for beef. The black-and-white Dutch cows are, and have been, the mainstay
of the dairy industry of Holland, and later of Denmark; while the small
Brittany cows are perhaps the best butter-producers on the continent of
Europe. But England and the Channel Islands may justly claim to rear the
finest cattle of the temperate parts of the world. The diminutive Jersey
cows, now reared in all parts of the kingdom, surpass all the animals of
Europe or America in the richness of their milk, while stock from the
pedigree herds of various English breeds is eagerly sought by foreign and
continental buyers on both sides of the Atlantic, and in New Zealand and
Australia. These foreign strains need constant replenishing from the
English herds, and the result is a golden harvest to the breeders in these
islands.

SPANISH CATTLE.

These belong to the long-horned race of Southern and Eastern Europe. In the
bulls the horns are shorter, and often turn downwards.]

The SHORTHORN was the first breed to be brought to perfection. Two main
stocks--one for producing beef, the other for the dairy--are recognised;
they are the "all-round breed" most in favour, and it is said that the
improvement in this race alone has raised the value of average Irish store
cattle £2 per head during the last twenty years. The shorthorns are
level-backed, large animals, maturing very quickly. The commonest colours
are roan, white, red, and red-and-white. HEREFORD CATTLE are red, with
white faces and long, upturned horns; they fatten quickly on good grass,
and are in most demand for summer beef. HIGHLAND CATTLE have long horns,
rough, shaggy coats, and bodies of moderate size and great symmetry; they
are grazed on the mountains of the West Highlands mainly, and fattened in
the south. The beef is of the finest quality. SUSSEX CATTLE are an "all
red" variety, large, and formerly much used for draught and farm work. The
DEVONS are another red variety very like the Sussex, yielding excellent and
rich milk, and, when fattened, being little inferior to any breed as beef.
The long-horned black WELSH CATTLE grow to a great size, as do the polled
ANGUS breed of Scotland. The polled or hornless cattle include the red
SUFFOLKS, a most valuable breed, hardy, and wonderful producers of milk.
The cows often give milk every day of the year. The LONGHORN breed is
almost disappearing, as the horns are a disadvantage both in the fields and
when the animals are carried on board ship or in the train. The HUMPED
CATTLE of India and East Africa belong to a race different from European
cattle, of which the parent stock is not known. They have a hump upon the
withers, drooping ears (a sign of ancient domestication), and a very large
dewlap. The coat is always exquisitely fine. They are of all sizes, from
the tall Brahminee bull to dwarf breeds not larger than a Newfoundland dog.
The commonest colours are cream, grey, mouse-colour, and white. They do not
low, but grunt, and are by no means so fond of shade and water as European
cattle.

YOUNG GAUR.

The largest and handsomest of the wild oxen.]


WILD OXEN.

This group consists of the GAUR of India; the GAYAL of Assam, which is
possibly a domesticated form of the gaur, but rather smaller in size, with
skull and horns different in character; and the BANTING, a lighter and more
slender wild ox, of which different varieties are found in Burma, in Java
(where it is kept in a half-domesticated condition), and in Manipur.


THE GAUR.

The GAUR, the so-called INDIAN BISON, is probably the largest of all the
wild bovine animals. It is found at the foot of the North-eastern Himalaya,
in the Central Provinces of India, the forests of Madras and Mysore, and in
parts of Burma and the Malay Peninsula, but not in Ceylon. Its range
eastward is not accurately known. In habits the gaur is mainly a forest
animal, retiring always at daybreak into the depths of the jungle. It
sometimes attains a height of over 6 feet at the shoulder, and a length of
9 feet 6 inches from the nose to the tail. The colour of the full-grown
gaur is dark brown, turning to black; the legs from above the knees and
hocks to the hoofs are white, the hair being short and fine. Its horns are
upturned, and tipped with black, with white hair covering the junction on
the top of the skull. The cows are much smaller than the bulls, standing
about 5 feet high at the shoulder. This species feeds both on grass and on
the young shoots of trees and of bamboos. The calves are dropped in August
and September. The pure-bred animal does not appear capable of
domestication.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

COW GAYAL.

This animal is not at all dissimilar to the gaur. Its chief points of
difference are in the horns and in the colour of its skin.]

Hunting gaur by tracking in the jungle has long been a favourite sport of
Anglo-Indians. General Douglas Hamilton says: "I have killed bulls
measuring 6 feet at the shoulder, and the average height of the male is
from 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 10 inches. An old bull gaur is a magnificent
animal. The normal colour is a brownish black, sometimes in very old
specimens almost quite black. The white stockings reach from the hoof to
above the knee, and are very conspicuous. When on the Anamalies, I had a
grand fight with a big bull. I was out early, and came on the spoor of
bison, and soon saw two, one a very large bull. To my disgust he lay down,
and was completely covered by creepers and bushes. After a bit I attempted
to move to get a better view; but there to my left was a cow bison staring
at me. She at once gave the alarm, and I waited for the large bull to rise.
This he did so quickly, and disappeared so suddenly, that I only got a
snapshot. As I stopped to load, I saw a young calf squatting at the foot of
a tree like a hare, intently watching me. I put the rifle down, crept up
behind the tree, and suddenly threw myself on the little calf, and managed
to get hold of its hind legs, but it got from under me. I managed, however,
to tie its fore legs securely by means of some slender stems from the
creepers. All this time it continued to bellow and to make a great row, and
I fully expected to see the mother come charging down. I went back to the
bungalow, and got some men to bring my little captive home. After breakfast
I started again, and got on the track of the bison.... I saw some branches
move, and on looking carefully perceived a large bull bison; but he was
among the thick bushes, and I could not see his outline. I guessed as
nearly as possible the position of the shoulder, and fired the big rifle at
him. He gave a bound forward, and then stopped long enough for me to give
him a shot with the other barrel.... The next moment I saw the bull
standing on the high ground above us. I fired again, and hit him well
behind the shoulder. He dashed off, but only went fifty yards, and then
stopped. I walked up, thinking to finish him, when he made a fearful rush
at me. My man put the double rifle into my hands and then bolted, and I
thought it prudent to retire and await my opportunity. But he only moved a
few paces forward, and then stopped. Then began a regular siege of his
position." The result of the siege was that the bison received four more
bullets, charged and routed the hunter twice, and then walked off. It was
shot twice more, charged again, and was finally killed by General Hamilton
with his hunting-knife tied to a bamboo spear-pole.

Considering the size and tenacity of life of the gaur, it is rather
wonderful that more accidents do not occur in the pursuit of this animal;
but as it lives mainly in thick jungle, where large trees grow, the
sportsman has more chance of getting out of sight of a wounded animal than
when attacked by the Indian buffalo, which generally haunts jungles of high
grass.

INDIAN HUMPED BULL.

The hump and dewlap mark the Oriental cattle. The ears are often more
drooping than in this specimen.]


THE GAYAL.

The doubt whether this animal is found in a wild state has recently been
considerably increased. It is well known in a semi-domesticated condition,
in which it is kept by the tribes in and around the Assam Valley, where the
wild gaur is also found. These herds roam during the day freely in the
jungle, and return to be fed at the villages. It has been stated that wild
gayal are enticed to join the tame herds by feeding them with balls of meal
and salt; but these "wild" specimens may be only those which have belonged
to or have descended from the domesticated herd. Gayal have been kept in
England not only in the Zoological Gardens but in some parks, and crossed
with English cattle. The offspring furnished excellent beef, but were
rather wild and intractable. The horns of the gayal are thicker and flatter
than those of the gaur, and placed lower on the skull and farther apart.
The domesticated gayal stands lower than the gaur, but is a very massive
animal.


THE BANTING.

The common wild ox of the Malay countries of Borneo, Java, Eastern Burma,
and northwards, in Manipur resembles the European oxen rather more than
does the gaur. In size the bulls sometimes reach 5 feet 9½ inches. The old
bulls are black, the younger bulls chocolate-red, and the cows a bright
reddish brown. The rump is marked with a large white patch, and all have
white stockings from above the knees and hocks down to the hoofs. The tail
is considerably longer than in the gaur, coming well below the hocks. As
might be expected from its distribution, the size of this animal and the
shape of the horns vary considerably in the different districts which it
inhabits. In Borneo the horns often curve forwards; in Java they spread
outwards. In the latter island large herds of this species are kept in a
state of domestication. When wild, banting live in small herds, and in
Burma feed from early morning until ten o'clock, when they retire into the
jungle for shelter. The Manipur race is smaller than that of Burma (of
which the males are not black), and the bulls have not the white rump.


THE YAK.

The YAK is naturally an inhabitant of the very high plateaux and mountains
of Tibet, where the climate is cold and the air excessively dry. Lower down
on the Indian side of the Himalaya a smaller race is found domesticated,
which is the only one able to stand the climate of India, or of Europe,
where it is now kept in some parks as a curiosity. The tamed yaks are
usually much smaller than the wild; these sometimes reach a weight of
between 1,100 and 1,200 lbs. In form they are long and low, very massive,
and with hair almost entirely black; this falls off along the sides into a
long sweeping fringe. The tail is thickly tasselled with fine hair, and is
employed by Indian princes for fly-flaps. The wild yak has large, massive
black horns, curved upwards and forwards in the male. In Ladak and Chinese
Tibet the yaks inhabit a desolate and barren country, in which their main
food is a dry, coarse grass, on which they nevertheless contrive to keep
themselves in condition, feeding in the mornings and evenings, and lying
down by day to rest among the rocks.

INDIAN HUMPED CATTLE.

These are often called Zebu in Europe, but the origin of the name in
unknown.]


THE BISON.

The BISON form a marked group, differing from others of the Ox Tribe. They
possess fourteen pairs of ribs, while the oxen have only thirteen (the yak
has fourteen); and have very heavy, massive heads, broader and more convex
foreheads than the oxen, longer spinal processes on the vertebrae of the
front part of the back, and larger muscles to hold the ponderous head,
causing a hump, which in the American bison is very marked. There are two
living species of bison, one of which is found in Europe, the other in
North America.


THE EUROPEAN BISON.

This is the most interesting survival of the primitive fauna of the Old
World. It is still found wild, though protected, in a large forest in
Lithuania, the property of the Czar of Russia, called the Forest of
Bielowitza. A few are also left of the purely wild stock in the Caucasus.
Those in Lithuania have been protected for several centuries, and the herd
is numbered from time to time. In 1857 there were 1,898 of these bison
left; in 1882 there were only 600; in 1889 the herd had sunk to 380, but in
1892 it had risen to 491. The presence of the bison in the Caucasus had
been almost forgotten till Mr. Littledale and Prince Demidoff gave accounts
of hunting it there quite recently. The ZUBR, as it is called, only
survives in some very inaccessible parts of the mountains, preserved by the
Grand Duke Sergius Michaelovitch, in the Kouban district. There it exists
as a really wild animal. The dimensions of one recently shot were 10 feet
from the muzzle to the end of the last vertebra of the tail. The Grand Duke
has to obtain special permission from the Czar to shoot one whenever he
goes to the Caucasus.

This bison seems to have been an inhabitant of most of the forests of
Europe and Northern Asia; its remains show that it existed in Britain, and
it was plentiful in the Black Forest in the time of Cæsar. It is the
largest of all European quadrupeds, measuring as much as 10 feet 1 inch
from the nose to the root of the tail, and standing nearly 6 feet high at
the shoulder. Prince Demidoff states his belief that it is found on the
southern slopes of the Caucasus Range between the hills and the Black Sea.
The weight of this bison reaches 1,700 lbs. It is now rare to see more than
five or six together. Though the animal is so massive, its horns are rather
small and slender, and curve upwards. The mane--which, like the rest of the
coat, is of a uniform rich brown--is thick and curly, but not developed
like that of the American bison.


THE AMERICAN BISON.

The American bison is the western representative of the bison of Europe.
The almost complete disappearance of this species is one of the warnings
against reckless destruction of animal life. It was formerly found in
millions on the prairies, and its meat formed the staple food of the Red
Indians, who lived on the flesh and used the "robes" of those killed in
winter for great coats and bedding. When Audubon went up the Upper
Missouri, bison were in sight almost throughout the voyage; they were even
carried down on ice-flows on the river. The bulls were very large, and were
occasionally savage, especially when attacked and wounded; but usually they
were harmless animals. Every winter and spring they made migrations along
regular routes to fresh pastures. These lines of travel were then black
with bison. The females had their calves by their sides, and all travelled
in herds, feeding as they went. At the present time the only remains of the
bison are the paths they left on the prairies, and their bones and skulls.
The paths are still distinctly seen, worn by the "treks" of the great
beasts which have now perished. The bones were collected in stacks and sold
to make manure.

DOMESTICATED YAK.

The wild bovine animal of the Central Asian plateau, tamed and
domesticated.]

Colonel Roosevelt, in an article contributed to "The Encyclopædia of
Sport," thus describes the destruction of the bison: "Pursuit by sportsmen
had nothing to do with the extermination of the bison. It was killed by the
hide-hunters, redskin, white, and half-breed. The railways, as they were
built, hastened its destruction, for they gave means of transporting the
heavy robes to market. But it would have been killed out anyhow, even were
there no railroads in existence. Once the demand for the robes became known
to the Indians, they were certain to exterminate it. Originally the bison
ranged from the Rocky Mountains to the Alleghanies, and from Mexico to the
Peace River. But its centre of abundance was the vast extent of grass-land
stretching from the Saskatchewan to the Rio Grande. All the earlier
explorers who crossed these great plains, from Lewis and Clarke onwards,
spoke of the astonishing multitudes of the bison, which formed the sole
food of the Horse Indians. The herds were pressed steadily back, but the
slaughter did not begin till after the Civil War; then the commercial value
of the robes became fully recognised, and the transcontinental railways
rendered the herds more accessible. The slaughter was almost incredible,
for the bison were slain literally by millions every year. They were first
exterminated in Canada and the southern plains. It was not till 1883 that
the last herd was killed off from the great north-western prairies."

The height of a fine bull American bison at the shoulder is 6 feet. The
horns are short, blunt, and curved, and set farther back on the forehead
than in the European species. The hindquarters are low and weak, and the
mane develops in winter into a thick robe, covering the neck, shoulders,
and chest. An adult bull bison was found to weigh 1,727 lbs. The
woodland-bison of Athabasca, now nearly exterminated, are larger than the
prairie-bison, and have finer coats. In 1897 there were said to be between
280 and 300 head remaining in two herds.


THE BUFFALOES.

The BUFFALOES are so far distinct from other wild cattle that they will not
interbreed with them; yet one species, the INDIAN BUFFALO, has been
domesticated for a long, though unknown period, and is among the most
valuable of tame beasts of draught, as well as for dairy purposes. The
various buffaloes usually have little hair, especially when old, and have
flatter shoulders than the gaur, gayal, or bison. The pairs of ribs number
thirteen.

AMERICAN BULL BISON.

The American bison (locally called "buffalo") is lower behind than its
European brother; but the withers, as will be seen from the photograph, are
stronger and more massive, and its mane considerably longer.]


THE AFRICAN BUFFALO.

Great differences in size and colour exist in the AFRICAN BUFFALOES.
Whether they are separate species or not may be doubtful; but the small
yellow CONGO BUFFALO, with upturned short horns, is a vastly different
creature from the large black CAPE BUFFALO. There is also an Abyssinian or
brown race of African buffalo, and another in Senegambia smaller than the
former, and a reputed grey race near Lake Tchad. The Cape buffalo is a
heavy, thickset animal, all black in colour, with large massive horns
covering the skull, and nearly meeting in the middle line of the forehead.
In height it varies from 4 feet 10 inches to 5 feet at the shoulder. This
species ranges from South Africa to the Congo on the west, and to the
region of the Equator on the east of the continent. Firearms, and lately
rinderpest, have greatly reduced the number of these creatures. They live
and feed in herds, and, like the Indian species, are fond of the
neighbourhood of water, in which they bathe, but are not so dependent on
bathing and wallowing as the former.

Fully as formidable as the Indian buffalo, and much like it in habits, the
African species is quite distinct. It has different horns, broad at the
base and curled and tapering at the ends. Among the extreme measurements of
the Indian buffalo's horns recorded is one of 12 feet 2 inches from tip to
tip along the curve. Those of the African buffalo are seldom more than 6
feet, measured in the same way. By far the greatest number of hunting
accidents in Africa are caused by the buffalo. Sir Samuel Baker shot a
buffalo bull one evening near the White Nile. His men actually danced upon
the body, when the animal rose to its feet, and sent them flying into the
river like so many frogs. It then disappeared in the thick vegetation. On
the following day, supposing that it must have died during the night,
thirty or forty men, armed with double-barrelled guns, went to look for it.
The result was thus recorded by Sir Samuel Baker: "They had not been ashore
for many minutes when I first heard a shot and then a regular volley. My
people returned with the head of the buffalo and a large quantity of meat,
but they also carried the body of my best man, who, when leading the way
through the high reeds, following the traces of blood, actually stumbled
upon the buffalo lying in the swamp, and the light guns failed to stop its
charge. The crooked horn had caught him behind the ear, and, penetrating
completely through the neck, had torn out the throat as though it had been
cut. The savage beast had then knelt upon the body, and stamped it into the
muddy ground, until it fell beneath the fire of thirty men."

The head and body of a male Cape buffalo are 9 feet long. It is stated that
the parasite conveyed by the tsetse fly remains in the blood of the buffalo
(which is not affected by it), and that this forms a reserve whence the
fly, after sucking the blood of the buffalo, poisons other animals.

EUROPEAN BISON.

These wild animals of the Caucasus are very much scarcer than formerly, and
are in danger of becoming extinct.]


THE CONGO BUFFALO.

This is a very small race, the height at the shoulder being about 3 feet 6
inches. The shape of the horns varies, but they are wrinkled at the bases
and flattened, and turn upwards, ending in thin, sharp tips. The hair is
bright reddish yellow. It is entirely a West African species. Sir Samuel
Baker records an instance in which his brother was nearly killed by a small
West African buffalo, probably one of the species in question. It is said
to be less gregarious than the Cape buffalo, and usually found in pairs.


THE INDIAN OR WATER-BUFFALO.

Very great interest attaches to this animal, if only from the fact that it
is evidently a species domesticated directly from the wild stock. It
therefore deserves consideration both as a wild and as a domesticated
animal. It is found wild in the swampy jungles at the foot of the Himalaya,
in the Ganges Delta, and in the jungles of the Central Provinces; also, it
is believed, in the jungles of West Assam. Like the African species, it is
an animal of great size and strength, with short brown hair, white
fetlocks, and immense long, narrow, flattened horns. It is almost aquatic
by preference, passing many hours of each day wallowing in the water, or
standing in any deep pool with only the tips of its nostrils and its horns
out of the water. By general consent it is the most dangerous of Indian
animals after the tiger. A buffalo bull when wounded will hunt for its
enemy by scent as persistently as a dog hunting for a rabbit. A writer in
_Country Life_ lately gave an account of a duel between himself, armed with
a small and light rifle, and a buffalo bull, in which the latter hunted him
for more than an hour, each time being driven off by a shot from the light
rifle, and each time returning to the search, until it was killed. Sir
Samuel Baker, when he first went to Ceylon, found the buffaloes practically
in possession of the meadows round a lake in the neighbourhood of his
quarters, and waged a war of extermination against the bulls, which were
very dangerous.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

AMERICAN BISON.

Notice the difference in the fore and hind quarters of this animal and the
European representative of the same group. (See page 216.)]

The buffaloes of Ceylon are the same as those of India, but the horns are
inferior in size. "The charge of a buffalo is a serious matter." says Sir
Samuel Baker. "Many animals charge when infuriated, but they can generally
be turned aside by the stunning blow of a rifle-shot, even if they be not
mortally wounded. But a buffalo is a devil incarnate when it has once
decided on the offensive; nothing will turn it. It must be actually stopped
by death, sudden and instantaneous, as nothing else will stop it. If not
killed, it will assuredly destroy its adversary. There is no creature in
existence so determined to stamp the life out of its opponents, and the
intensity of its fury is unsurpassed when a wounded bull rushes forward
upon its last desperate charge. Should it succeed in overthrowing its
antagonist, it will not only gore the body with its horns, but will kneel
upon the lifeless form, and stamp it with its hoofs till the mutilated
remains are beyond recognition."

DOMESTICATED INDIAN BUFFALO.

This animal is found as a wild and domesticated species in India. It is
valuable as a beast of draught and for the dairy.]

The true Indian buffalo is usually shot from the back of an elephant.
Hunting it on foot is dangerous in the extreme, for the buffalo can crash
through obstacles which would prevent any man from making his way through
them when escaping. When domesticated, the Indian buffalo loses most traces
of its savageness; it is habitually managed by the children, who take the
herds out to graze in the jungle, and drive them back, often riding on one
of the bulls, at night. They dislike Europeans, and often show this by
attacking them; but otherwise they are quite tame, and are docile when in
harness or carrying burdens. The buffalo's milk is very rich, and makes a
much larger percentage of butter than ordinary cow's milk. So useful is
this mud- and water-loving animal in all swampy districts, that wherever
rice is cultivated it is almost indispensable. The result is that the
Indian buffalo has been transported, probably in comparatively modern
times, to many distant quarters of the globe. When this was done is not
known; but it is probable, for instance, that it was not known in Egypt in
the days of the Pharaohs, for its form never appears in the paintings and
sculptures. Now it is seen very far up the Nile, and plays an important
part in Egyptian agriculture; it is also the general beast of burden and
for the dairy in the Pontine Marshes of Italy. In Spain it was probably
introduced by the Arabs, and is used to cultivate the marshy plains near
the mouths of the rivers of Andalusia; it is also in use in the marshes of
Hungary, in the Crimea, and across Western Asia to Afghanistan. We have
thus the curious fact that a wild animal once confined to the jungles of
the Indian Peninsula is now domesticated on two other continents. It has
not been introduced into America yet, though it would be useful in the
Mississippi swamps; but the Chinese have taken it to the Far East, and
established it as their favourite beast of burden.


THE TAMARAU AND ANOA.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

A PAIR OF ANOAS.

The anoa is the smallest and most antelope-like member of the Ox Tribe.]

In the island of Mindoro, in the Philippines, a small black buffalo, with
upright, slightly incurved horns, is found in the dense forests. The height
at the shoulder is about 3 feet 6 inches; a few irregular marks of white
are found on the fore legs, face, and occasionally the throat. It is called
the TAMARAU by the natives, most of whom fear to attack it. Its habits are
said to be much the same as those of the other buffaloes; but it is reputed
to fight with the Indian buffaloes which have escaped and become semi-wild
in the forests.

In Celebes a still smaller wild forest-buffalo is found, called the ANOA.
It is only 3 feet 3 inches high at the shoulder, and has upright, almost
straight horns. The general colour is brownish, tinged with yellow, that of
the adults being very dark brown or black. Scarcely anything is known of
its habits.


THE MUSK-OX.

The MUSK-OX was formerly found in immense numbers on the barren lands and
other regions bordering on the Arctic ice. The hair of this animal reaches
almost to the ground, and the horns are large and massive. At present it is
only common in the corner of North America north and east of a line drawn
from Fort Churchill, on Hudson Bay, to the mouth of the Mackenzie, and on
the adjacent islands of the Arctic Sea. In former Arctic expeditions the
flesh of the musk-oxen was a great and reliable source of food. Now some
parts of the herds seem to have retired inland, and in the winter to become
mainly forest-dwellers; but large numbers seem to endure the coldest parts
of the Arctic winter in the open country of the Far North, in the snows of
Grinnell Land and of Northern Greenland. The remains of musk-oxen have been
found in the river gravels of the Thames Valley, with those of the reindeer
and other northern species. The musk-ox gallops at a great rate of speed
when disturbed in the open, and makes as little of a steep mountain-side as
does the wild sheep. When fat, the flesh is very tolerable food; but if the
animals grow thin, the taste of musk is very unpleasant. The colour of the
coat is dark brown; it is now in great demand for sledge-rugs in Canada.
This remarkable animal appears to be a form standing apart both from the
oxen and the sheep.

YOUNG BULL MUSK-OX.

The musk-ox is nearly allied to the sheep. It is about the size of Highland
cattle, and inhabits Arctic America and Northern Greenland.]



It will be seen from the above accounts of the whole wild bovine race that
they all exhibit in a high degree many of the traits which are seen in
domesticated animals of the same tribe. The chief differences made by man's
selection and breeding affect the form of the body and the development of
the udder, otherwise there is no great modification, except the production
of the drooping ear in some of the Indian species of domesticated oxen. No
wild cattle have the level, flat back and rectangular body which mark all
the best shorthorns and other breeds intended for beef. In the Asiatic and
Galla humped breeds, the races which first domesticated the original wild
species seem to have used the long processes of the vertebræ which cause
the back of many wild cattle to form a hump as the basis of a valuable
feature, the hump becoming as it were another joint of meat. The
development of the udder has for untold centuries been the object of the
breeders of cows; consequently we find that in the domesticated races this
has become abnormally large. There is at present a very general tendency to
get rid of the horns among all breeds of high quality, as these appendages
cause much loss by wounds inflicted by cattle upon each other; but even in
this respect sentiment rather tends to preserve the horns as an ornament in
some of the best milking breeds, such as the Jerseys.

CHAPTER XIV.

_THE SHEEP AND GOATS._

----

THE SHEEP.

The sheep are represented at the present time by several wild species, one
of which is found in Northern India east of the Indus, in the Punjab, and
in Sind; one in North America; and another in North Africa. The rest
inhabit the high ground of Europe and Asia as far south as the Himalaya.
These mountains, with the adjacent plateaux of the Pamirs and the great
ranges of Central Asia, form the main home of the group. Wild sheep are of
various types, some so much like the goats that it is difficult to draw a
hard-and-fast line between them; while others, especially the Curly-horned
Argalis, Bighorns, Oorial, and Kamchatka Wild Sheep, are unmistakably ovine
in type. The wild original of the domesticated breeds of sheep is unknown;
but the extreme differences between various breeds of tame sheep--as, for
instance, between the smooth-coated, drooping-eared breed of Nubia and the
curly-horned, woolly sheep of Dorsetshire--must not be allowed to divert
the attention from the considerable likeness of habit which still remains
between other breeds and the wild species. Domesticated sheep which live on
hills and mountains are still inclined to seek the highest ground at night.
The rams fight as the wild rams do, and many of them display activity and
powers of climbing and of finding a living on barren ground scarcely less
remarkable than in the wild races. The apparent absence of wool in the
latter does not indicate so great a difference as might be thought. The
domesticated sheep have been bred by artificial selection for unnumbered
ages in order to produce wool. It is said that in some of the wild breeds
there is an under-fur which will "felt" like wool. Most of the species are
short-tailed animals, but this is not the case with the Barbary wild sheep.

Wild sheep are mainly mountain-living animals or frequenters of high
ground. They generally, although not always, frequent less rugged country
than that affected by the wild goats, and some are found at quite low
levels. The altitude at which other wild sheep are found is, however, very
great; on the Pamirs it reaches 20,000  feet. Here the country is quite
open.

THE EUROPEAN MOUFFLON.

The only wild sheep of Europe is the MOUFFLON, found in the mountains of
Corsica and Sardinia. Its height at the shoulder is about 27 inches. In the
rams the horns are strong, and curved into a spiral, forming almost a
complete circle. The hair is close, and in winter has a woolly under-fur.
In summer and autumn the coat is a bright red-brown on the neck, shoulders,
and legs; the rump and under-parts are whitish, and the back and flanks
marked with a white saddle. In winter the brown becomes darker and the
white saddle broader. A rather larger moufflon is found on Mount Elburz in
Persia, in Armenia, and in the Taurus Mountains. A smaller variety exists
in Cyprus, where it has been preserved since the British occupation. The
moufflon is a typical wild sheep. In Sardinia and Corsica are dense scrubby
forests of tall heather, some 5 feet high. This _maquia_ is practically
impenetrable to hunters. When alarmed, the moufflon dash into it, and are
safe. The _maquia_ has preserved two very interesting survivals of
antiquity--the moufflon, and the Corsican or Sardinian bandit. The Corsican
bandit, like the moufflon of the same island, is nearly extinct. In
Sardinia both flourish. Many English sportsmen have had their first taste
of big-game shooting in the difficult pursuit of the moufflon on the
Sardinian mountains. Some declare that the sport is so fascinating that
they have seldom found much to equal it since. Mr. S. H. Whitbread, whose
notes in "The Encyclopædia of Sport" are very full on this subject, deems
that the best season to stalk moufflon is in October or November. The
animals are then less disturbed by shepherds and dogs, and the moufflon are
on the move and more easily seen during the day than in summer, when they
feed at night and rest or sleep by day.

Sir E. G. Loder has a small herd of moufflon running wild in his park at
Leonardslee, near Horsham. They have a specially built "mountain-top" of
stone to make a home of, but are free to feed where they like in the park.
They produce lambs yearly. It is an interesting sight to see the quick rush
of the little flock, when frightened, to their sheltering-place, led by an
old white-saddled ram.

SIBERIAN ARGALI.

One of the large wild sheep of Central Asia.]


THE ARGALIS.

The ARGALIS are the largest of all living wild sheep. Some measure from 3
feet 9 inches to 4 feet at the shoulder. The horns are broad, corrugated,
and curling in the male, and in the female short, erect, and curving
backwards. The male TIBETAN ARGALI has a ruff on the throat. The usual
colour is a stony grey, mingled with white in the summer in the case of the
old males. The name is applied collectively to several wild sheep found in
Northern and Central Asia. Whether these are only varieties or separate
species it is difficult to say; but the following are some of the most
marked forms.

The SIBERIAN ARGALI is the characteristic wild sheep of the rocky hills and
mountains of Southern Siberia, the Altai Mountains, and Northern Mongolia.
The horns curve so as to form more than a complete circle; the upper parts
are tinged with grey, and the lower are white.

The TIBETAN ARGALI is a little smaller in size, and has slightly smaller
horns. The rams have also a large white ruff on the throat. These sheep
descend in winter to the lower valleys of the Tibetan plateau, returning to
the higher ground in spring. The lambs are born in May or June.

BARBARY SHEEP.

These fine wild sheep are found in the Atlas and Aures Mountains of North
Africa.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

BARBARY SHEEP.

This shows a fine ram, with a mane reaching almost to its hoofs.]

LITTLEDALE'S SHEEP is a smaller animal, found on the Sair Mountains in the
Great Altai, on the north-western border of Mongolia. It is darker in
colour than the argali or Marco Polo's sheep, and has dark under-parts.

Writing of the argali of Southern Siberia, the naturalist Brehm says that
when the Tartars want mutton an argali hunt is organised. The Tartar
hunters advance on their horses at intervals of 200 or 300 yards, and when
the sheep are started generally manage, by riding, shooting, coursing them
with dogs, and shouting, to bewilder, shoot, or capture several.

On the high plateau of the Pamirs and the adjacent districts MARCO POLO'S
SHEEP is found. The rams are only slightly less in size than the Siberian
argali; the hair is longer than in that species, and the horns are thinner
and more slender and extend farther in an outward direction. An adult ram
may weigh 22 stone. The first description of this sheep was given by the
old traveller whose name it now bears. He said that on the Pamir plateau
wild animals are met with in large numbers, particularly a sheep of great
size, having horns three, four, and even six palms in length. The shepherds
(? hunters) form ladles and vessels from them. In the Pamirs, Marco Polo's
sheep is seldom found at less than 11,000 or 12,000 feet above the sea. In
the Thian-shan Mountains it is said to descend to 2,000 or 3,000 feet. They
prefer the hilly, grassy plains, and only seek the hills for safety. On the
Pamirs they are said to be very numerous in places, one hunter stating that
he saw in one day not less than 600 head.


THE BIGHORN SHEEP OF AMERICA AND KAMCHATKA.

North America has its parallel to the argalis in the famous BIGHORN. It is
now very rare even in Northern Canada, and becoming scarce in the United
States, though a few are found here and there at various points on the
Rocky Mountains as far south as Mexico. In habits it is much the same as
other wild sheep--that is to say, it haunts the rock-hills and "bad lands"
near the mountains, feeding on the scanty herbage of the high ground, and
not descending unless driven down by snow.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

BURHAL WILD SHEEP.

Sometimes called the Blue Sheep. They have a wide range both on the
Himalaya and north of those mountains.]

The bighorn sheep are very partial to salt. Mr. Turner Turner, who hunted
them in East Kooteney, says: "Wild sheep make periodical excursions to the
mountain-tops to gorge themselves with salty clay. They may remain from an
hour to two days, and when killed their stomachs will be found full of
nothing but the clay formed from denuded limestone, which they lick and
gnaw until sometimes deep tunnels are formed in the cliffs, large enough to
hide six or seven sheep. The hunter, standing over one of these warrens,
may bolt them within two yards of him. In the dead of winter sheep often
come to the woods to feed on fir-trees. At such times they may be seen
mixed with black-and-white-tailed deer, low on a river-bank. I have known
them come within forty yards of an inhabited hut."

While on the subject of the fondness of sheep and deer for salt, we may
mention an anecdote told by Mr. H. C. Nelson in _Country Life_. He was
sleeping with two other friends in a hut in the mountains where some miners
had lived for a time. These men, when they washed up their pots and pans,
threw the slops away at a certain place close by the hut. As all water used
for cooking meat has salt put into it, a little salt remained on the
surface. This the wild deer had found out, and were in the habit of coming
to lick it at night. Mr. Nelson had a shot at one some twenty yards from
the hut.

The bighorn sheep stands from 3 feet 2 inches to 3 feet 6 inches at the
shoulder. The horns are of the general type of the argalis, but smoother.
Another bighorn is found in Kamchatka. There is also a beautiful white race
of bighorn inhabiting Alaska. The typical Rocky Mountain race is browner
than the Asiatic argalis, and in winter is dark even beneath the front
parts of the body. It is not found on the high peaks of the great ranges,
but on difficult though lower ground on the minor hills.


THE OORIAL.

The vast range of the Himalaya affords feeding-ground to other species of
wild sheep and wild goat, so different in the shape of the horns that the
variations of the ovine race under domestication need not be matter for
wonder when so much variety is seen in nature.

The OORIAL, or SHA, is found in North-west India, on the Trans-Indus
Mountains, and in Ladak, Northern Tibet, Afghanistan, Baluchistan,
Turkestan, and Southern Persia. The horns make a half-curve backwards, and
are flattened. The angle with the horizontal line across the ears is about
half a right angle. The coat is of a reddish-brown colour, with white on
the belly, legs, and throat. This species has a very wide geographical
distribution, and is the only wild sheep found in India proper.

FAT-TAILED SHEEP.

The fat tail of this sheep was considered by Charles Darwin as due to
degeneration.]


THE BARBARY SHEEP, AOUDAD, OR ARUI.

This is a large wild sheep of the North African highlands. The old rams
have a very fine appearance, with a long flowing beard or mane, and large
horns. These wild sheep, though somewhat goat-like in appearance, are
typical of their race in general habits. They live in the Atlas Range, and
in the splendid heights of the Aures Mountains, which lie at the back of
Algeria and fringe the great Sahara Desert. In the isolated and burning
rocks which jut up in the desert itself into single mountains they are also
found, living on ground which seems absolutely destitute of water, grass,
or vegetation. They live singly or in small families; but the rams keep
mainly alone. Sometimes they lie in shallow caves during the heat of the
day. These caves smell like a sheep-fold. More generally the sheep repose
on some shelf of rock, where they exactly match the colour of the stone,
and are invisible. The ground is among the most difficult in which any
hunting is attempted, except perhaps in chamois-stalking; but the pursuit
seems to fascinate sportsmen. Mr. A. E. Pease recently gave some charming
descriptions of the silence, the rugged rocks, and the astonishing views
over the great orange Sahara Desert seen from the tops of these haunts of
the Barbary sheep--mountains on the summits of which his Arab guides would
prostrate themselves in evening prayer as the sun sank over the desert, and
then, rising, once more resume the chase. The young lambs of the Barbary
sheep are charming little creatures, more like reddish kids. They can
follow the mother over the steepest ground at a great pace. When caught, as
they sometimes are by the Arabs, they soon become tame. The tail is longer
than in other wild sheep, and in the males a large mane covers the chest.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

FOUR-HORNED SHEEP.

There are several breeds of these sheep, some from China, some from
Iceland, and others from South Africa.]


THE BURHAL, OR BLUE SHEEP.

This species possibly indicates the transition-point from the sheep to the
goats. It was pointed out by Mr. Brian Hodgson that it had certain features
more like the goats than the sheep, and later other writers laid stress on
structural differences of the same kind, both in skull and horns. It has
not the disagreeable odour of the goats; but the black markings which
separate the white of the belly from the brown of the flanks, and run down
the front of the legs, are like those seen on some goats. The horns rise in
a curve outwards and downwards. The largest are only some 30 inches long.

Burhal are perhaps the commonest of all Asiatic wild sheep. They inhabit
the whole length of the higher Himalayan Range, and are found over and
round the Central Asian plateau as far north as Yarkand. The horns make two
half-moons at right angles to the skull. Unlike some of the other wild
sheep, burhal often climb the very highest ground of all. Much of the best
burhal ground is above 17,000 feet high, and, as Mr. Whitbread remarks,
this alone makes the chase of such an animal difficult. As in the moufflon,
the mutton is excellent. There is no difficulty whatever in taming these
wild Himalayan sheep; those in the Zoological Gardens are practically
domesticated.


DOMESTICATED SHEEP.

Under domestication sheep exhibit a wide variety of coat, shape, and size,
very striking to the eye, and very important in regard to the produce of
wool or mutton. The introduction of a particular breed, with long wool or
short wool as the case may be, has often saved or altered for a time the
economic condition of a colony or province. It was the introduction of the
sheep which gave Australia first rank among the rich colonies of the world;
and the discovery that the Cheviot breed would thrive on the Scotch hills
made millions of acres remunerative which might otherwise have been very
unproductive. But the only important change in the structure of the sheep
in domestication is the lengthening of the tail. The carcase may be fat
mutton or thin mutton, the wool long or short, fine or coarse; but the
sheep itself remains true to type, and of much the same docile habits,
under all the changes of the breeders.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted_.

SOUTH DOWN SHEEP.

The finest breed of down-sheep.]

We may first say a word or two as to foreign breeds of sheep, especially
those of the East. Some of these resemble the wild breeds in having smooth
coats and almost no wool. The SOMALI SHEEP, for instance, yield no wool
useful for felting or spinning. They have drooping ears and black heads.
Some of the finest natural wool is developed by a white sheep in Tibet. The
fur is usually sold as Tibetan lamb. The wool is exactly like white
floss-silk. When cured by the Chinese, the leather is like white kid, with
this flossy wool attached.

MERINO RAMS.

The best wool-producing sheep. Imported from Spain to Australia.]

In India and Persia the sheep is sometimes used as a beast of burden. Mr.
Lockwood Kipling, in his "Beast and Man in India," says: "Borax,
asafoetida, and other commodities are brought into India on the backs of
sheep in bags. The flocks are driven in large numbers from Tibet into
British territory. One of the sensations of journeying in the hills of the
'interior,' as the farther recesses of the mountains are called by
Anglo-Indians, is to come suddenly on such a drove, as it winds, with the
multitudinous click of little feet, round the shoulder of some Himalayan
spur. The coarse hair bags scrape the cliffside from which the narrow path
is built out or hollowed, and allow but scant room for your pony, startled
by the hurry and the quick-breathing rush of the creatures as they crowd
and scuffle past. Only the picturesque shepherds return from these
journeys. The carriers of the caravan (_i.e._ the sheep), feeding as they
go, gather flesh in spite of their burdens, and provide most excellent
mutton.... In the towns of the plains rams are kept as fighting animals. A
Mohammedan swell going out for a stroll with his fighting-ram makes a
picture of foppery not easily surpassed by the sporting 'fancy' of the
West. The ram is neatly clipped, with a judicious reservation of the
salient tufts, tipped with saffron and mauve dye, and besides a large
collar of blue beads it wears a necklace of hawk-bells."

The FAT-TAILED SHEEP of Persia and Tartary exhibits a curious provision of
nature. When food is plentiful, a quantity of fat accumulates on the tail
and croup. As the pasture dries up and the animal finds little food, this
store of fat is gradually absorbed. Another fat-tailed sheep is found from
Syria and Egypt to the Cape. This has a long tail reaching to the ground.
In the Egyptian breed the tail is broad throughout; in the Syrian it
narrows to a point. The ordinary weight of the Syrian sheep's tail is 15
lbs.; but in some well-fattened examples it reaches 70 or 80 lbs. Ludolph
saw in Egypt a sheep's tail of 80 lbs. weight. This overgrown tail is a
great encumbrance to the animal. In order to lighten the burden, the
shepherds fasten under it a small board, sometimes with wheels attached, to
make it easy to draw over the ground.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

BLACK-FACED MOUNTAIN-SHEEP.

The sheep of the high mountains and heather-moors.]

In Greece, Wallachia, and Western Asia a fine breed of sheep, quite
different from the English forms, is seen. It is called the WALLACHIAN
SHEEP. When the Zoological Gardens were first founded here, some of these
sheep were introduced and crossed with English breeds. The horns are tall
spirals, as in the great kudu antelope. The body is large, and the fleece
long and straight, and more like that of the long-haired goats than curly
wool.

There are now few countries in the world to which sheep have not been
introduced. They were probably among the earliest animals to be
domesticated. Certainly they are the first to be mentioned; for we learn
that "Abel was a keeper of sheep," while Cain tilled the earth. The feud
between the keeper of flocks and the grower of crops typified in this
ancient quarrel still goes on wherever the wild mountain breeds of sheep
are kept, for there is of necessity always danger that the wandering sheep
may raid the plots of corn. In Spain a curious and ancient set of laws
regulates the passage of the flocks to and from the mountain pastures
through the corn-lands.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

LEICESTER EWE.

A heavy, long-woolled breed.]

It is said that the name of the famous breed of Spanish sheep known as
MERINOS recalls their foreign origin from across the sea, and that they
were originally imported into Spain from England. Whether that be so or
not, it is certain that no one could recognise them now. The finest merino
sheep, especially those bred in Australia, into which country they were
imported some forty years ago, look as if covered with a dense growth of
moss. The close wool grows not only on their backs, sides, and bellies, but
on legs, forehead, and nose. There are believed to be ten millions of
merino sheep in Spain, most of which are migratory. They are called
"transhumantes," and are taken from the plains to the mountains and from
the mountains to the plains yearly. These "transhumantes" are divided into
flocks, each under a head shepherd, or "majoral." The flocks follow the
shepherds, who lead the way, and direct the length and speed of the
journey. A few wethers, trained to the business, follow the shepherds, and
the rest come in due order. Powerful dogs accompany them as guards. This
system of sheep migration is controlled by a tribunal termed the Mesta. It
can be traced back to the middle of the fourteenth century. By it persons
are prohibited from travelling along the course of the route pursued by the
flocks so long as they are on the road. It also maintains the right for the
flocks to graze on all the open or common land that lies in the way.
Moreover, it claims a path ninety yards wide through all enclosed and
cultivated country. The length of the journey is over 400 miles, which is
accomplished in six or seven weeks. The system works greatly to the injury
of local cultivators and stationary flocks, whose fields are injured by the
migratory sheep.

CROSS-BRED SHEEP.

The class of sheep kept mainly on cultivated land in the North Midlands.]


ENGLISH BREEDS OF SHEEP.

In England are reared the finest and most valuable sheep. This is evident
from the prices paid for them by foreigners and breeders in our colonies.
Except for merinos, no one comes to any other country but this when about
to seek new blood for their flocks or to stock new lands. Recently 1,000
guineas were paid by a firm in Argentina for a single Lincoln ram.

Differences, well marked and of great importance, exist between our
different breeds. Each suits its own district, and each is carefully
improved and kept pure by herd-books, in which all pedigree animals are
entered.

The "general utility sheep" in England is the SOUTH DOWN; in Scotland, the
BORDER LEICESTER. The former is a small, fine sheep, with close wool, and
yielding excellent mutton. It provides the meat sold in our best shops, and
has largely stocked New Zealand. The original breed of England was possibly
the COTSWOLD; it is a tall, long-woolled, white-fleeced sheep. Later a
large heavy sheep, with long wool and a massive body, was bred in the
Midlands, and called the LEICESTER LONG-WOOL. This sheep gives a great cut
of wool, and much coarse mutton. The CHEVIOT SHEEP, originally bred on the
hills of that name, is now one of the mainstays of the Scotch mountain
farmer. The Cheviots eat the grass on the high hillsides, while the
BLACK-FACED HIGHLAND SHEEP live on the heather higher up. The SUFFOLK,
OXFORD, HAMPSHIRE, and other "Down" sheep are larger breeds than the South
Down. The ROMNEY MARSH SHEEP are a heavy long-woolled breed. The EXMOORS
are small heather-sheep like those of Wales, and the SOA and ST. KILDA
SHEEP, which are often four-horned, the smallest of all.

The maintenance of flocks is now almost an essential part of English
agriculture on all chalk lands, which comprise a very large percentage of
the southern counties. On the chalk downs the flocks are the great
fertilisers of the soil. Every night the sheep are folded on the fields
which are destined to produce corn in the following year. The manure so
left on the soil ensures a good crop, with no expense for carting the
fertiliser from the farmyard, as is the case with manure made by oxen kept
in straw-yards.

On the South Downs, Oxfordshire Downs or Chiltern Hills, Salisbury Plain,
and the Berkshire Downs the farms have been mainly carried on by the aid of
the flocks. Where these are no longer kept the land reverts to grass, and
the growing of corn ceases. On the coarse, new-sown grasses cattle take the
place of sheep, and an inferior style of farming, like the ranches of South
America, replaces the careful and highly skilled agriculture of Old
England. In the far north of Scotland cross-bred sheep are now reared and
fed in winter on turnips, which will grow luxuriantly where the climate is
too bleak and wet for wheat.

Formerly cattle were the main source of wealth to the owners of Highland
estates. The sheep was only introduced after the Highlands were subdued
subsequently to the rebellion in 1745. It was found that the rough-coated
heather-sheep throve on the wet and elevated hills. This led to their
substitution for cattle, as wool was then dear. Sheep are now in their turn
giving way to grouse and deer over much of the Central Highlands, as the
price of wool has fallen.

THE GOATS.

Though the dividing-line between the Sheep and Goats is very indistinct,
some differences are of general application. The goats are distinguished by
the unpleasant "hircine" odour of the males, and by beards on the chins of
the same sex, by the absence of glands in the hind feet, which sheep
possess, and by certain variations in the formation of the skull. The
difference between the temperament of the sheep and goats is very curious
and persistent, showing itself in a marked way, which affects their use in
domestication to such a degree that the keeping of one or the other often
marks the owners as possessors of different degrees of civilisation. Goats
are restless, curious, adventurous, and so active that they cannot be kept
in enclosed fields. For this reason they are not bred in any numbers in
lands where agriculture is practised on modern principles; they are too
enterprising and too destructive. Consequently the goat is usually only
seen in large flocks on mountain pastures and rocky, uncultivated ground,
where the flocks are taken out to feed by the children.

ANGORA RAM.

These goats were originally obtained from Turkey in Asia, and exported to
South Africa.]

On the high Alps, in Greece, on the Apennines, and in Palestine the goat is
a valuable domestic animal. The milk, butter, and cheese, and also the
flesh of the kids, are in great esteem. But wherever the land is enclosed,
and high cultivation attempted, the goat is banished, and the more docile
and controllable sheep takes its place. In Syria the goat is perhaps more
docile and better understood as a dairy animal than elsewhere in the East.
The flocks are driven into Damascus in the morning; and instead of a
milk-cart calling, the flock itself goes round the city, and particular
goats are milked before the doors of regular customers.

The EUROPEAN GOAT is a very useful animal for providing milk to poor
families in large towns. The following account of its present uses was
recently published: "The sheep, while preserving its hardy habits in some
districts, as on Exmoor, in Wales, and the Highlands, adapts itself to
richer food, and acquires the habits as well as the digestion of
domestication. The goat remains, as in old days, the enemy of trees,
inquisitive, omnivorous, pugnacious. It is unsuited for the settled life of
the English farm. Rich pasture makes it ill, and a good clay soil, on which
cattle grow fat, kills it. But it is far from being disqualified for the
service of some forms of modern civilisation by the survival of primitive
habits. Though it cannot live comfortably in the smiling pastures of the
low country, it is perfectly willing to exchange the rocks of the mountain
for a stable-yard in town. Its love for stony places is amply satisfied by
the granite pavement of a 'mews,' and it has been ascertained that goats
fed in stalls and allowed to wander in paved courts and yards live longer
and enjoy better health than those tethered even on light pastures. In
parts of New York the city goats are said to flourish on the paste-daubed
paper of the advertisements, which they nibble from the hoardings. It is
beyond doubt that these hardy creatures are exactly suited for living in
large towns; an environment of bricks and mortar and paving-stones suits
them. Their spirits rise in proportion to what we should deem the
depressing nature of their surroundings. They love to be tethered on a
common, with scanty grass and a stock of furze-bushes to nibble. A deserted
brick-field, with plenty of broken drain-tiles, rubbish-heaps, and weeds,
pleases them still better. Almost any kind of food seems to suit them. Not
even the pig has so varied a diet as the goat; it consumes and converts
into milk not only great quantities of garden-stuff which would otherwise
be wasted, but also, thanks to its love for eating twigs and shoots, it
enjoys the prunings and loppings of bushes and trees. In the Mont d'Or
district of France the goats are fed on oatmeal porridge. With this diet,
and plenty of salt, the animals are scarcely ever ill, and never suffer
from tuberculosis; they will often give ten times their own weight of milk
in a year."

The Kashmir shawls are made of the finest goats' hair. Most of this very
soft hair is obtained from the under-fur of goats kept in Tibet, and by the
Kirghiz in Central Asia. Only a small quantity, averaging 3 ozs., is
produced yearly by each animal. The wool is purchased by middlemen, and
taken to Kashmir for manufacture.

In India the goat reaches perhaps the highest point of domestication. The
flocks are in charge of herd-boys, but the animals are so docile that they
are regarded with no hostility by the cultivators of corn and cereals. Tame
goats are also kept throughout Africa. The valuable ANGORA breed, from
which "mohair" is obtained, is now domesticated in South Africa and in
Australia. In the former country it is a great commercial success. The
animals were obtained with great difficulty, as the Turkish owners did not
wish to sell their best-bred goats; but when once established at the Cape,
it was found that they proved better producers of mohair than when in their
native province of Angora. The "clip" from their descendants steadily
improves.

WILD GOATS

THE TUR.

In the Caucasus, both east and west, in the Pyrenees, and on the South
Spanish sierras three fine wild goats, with some features not unlike the
burhal sheep, are found. They are called TUR by the Caucasian mountaineers.
The species found in the East Caucasus differs from that of the west of the
range, and both from that of Spain. The EAST CAUCASIAN TUR is a massive,
heavy animal, all brown in colour (except on the fronts of the legs, which
are blackish), and with horns springing from each side of the skull like
half-circles. The males are 38 inches high at the shoulder. The short beard
and tail are blackish, and there is no white on the coat. The WEST
CAUCASIAN TUR is much lighter in colour than that of the East Caucasus, and
the horns point backwards, more like those of the ibex, though set on the
skull at a different angle. The SPANISH TUR has the belly and inner sides
of the legs white, and a blackish line along the flank, dividing the white
from the brown; also a blackish chest, and some grey on the flank.

In the Caucasus the tur are found on the high crags above the snow-line in
summer, whence they descend at night to feed on patches of upland grass;
but the main home of the tur by day is above the snowline. The Spanish
species modifies its habits according to the ground on which it lives. Mr.
E. N. Buxton found it in dense scrub, while on the Andalusian sierras it
frequents bare peaks 10,000 feet high. In Spain tur are sometimes seen in
flocks of from 100 to 150 each.

FEMALE TOGGENBURG GOAT.

These goats are milk-goats _par excellence_; they remain in profit for at
least ten months in the year. Each goat produces on an average from 110 to
120 gallons of milk during the year.]

[Illustration: _By permission of P. Thomas, Esq._

STUD TOGGENBURG GOAT.

This breed originally came from Switzerland, but is now well known in
England. The animals are fine in bone, have a long, thin neck, with two
tassel-like appendages.]


THE PERSIAN WILD GOAT.

The original of our domesticated goat is thought by some to be the PASANG,
or PERSIAN WILD GOAT. It is a fine animal, with large scimitar-shaped
horns, curving backwards, flattened laterally, and with knobs on the front
edge at irregular intervals. It is more slender in build than the tur,
light brown in general colour, marked with a black line along the nape and
back, black tail, white belly, blackish shoulder-stripe, and a black line
dividing the hinder part of the flank from the white belly. Formerly found
in the islands of South-eastern Europe, it now inhabits parts of the
Caucasus, the Armenian Highlands, Mount Ararat, and the Persian mountains
as far east as Baluchistan. A smaller race is found in Sind. It lives in
herds, sometimes of considerable size, and frequents not only the high
ground, but the mountain forests and scrub, where such cover exists. The
domesticated goat of Sweden is said to be certainly a descendant of this
species.

SCHWARTZALS GOAT.

A large, long-haired breed, which derives its name from its peculiar
colour, the fore part of the body being black and the hinder part white.
These goats are good milkers.]


THE IBEX.

Of the IBEX, perhaps the best known of all the wild goats, several species,
differing somewhat in size and in the form of their horns, are found in
various parts of the Old World. Of these, the ARABIAN IBEX inhabits the
mountains of Southern Arabia, Palestine, and Sinai, Upper Egypt, and
perhaps Morocco. The ABYSSINIAN IBEX is found in the high mountains of the
country from which it takes its name. The ALPINE IBEX is now extinct in the
Swiss Alps and Tyrol, but survives on the Piedmontese side of Monte Rosa.
The ASIATIC IBEX is the finest of the group; its horns have been found to
measure 54¾ inches along the curve. This ibex inhabits the mountain-ranges
of Central Asia, from the Altai to the Himalaya, and the Himalaya as far as
the source of the Ganges.

The King of Italy is the great preserver of the ALPINE IBEX, and has
succeeded where the nobles of the Tyrol have failed. The animals are shot
by driving them, the drivers being expert mountaineers. The way in which
the ibex come down the passes and over the precipices is simply
astonishing. One writer lately saw them springing down perpendicular
heights of 40 feet, or descending "chimneys" in the mountain-face by simply
cannoning off with their feet from side to side. Young ibex can be tamed
with ease, the only drawback to their maintenance being the impossibility
of confining them. They will spring on to the roof of a house, and spend
the day there by preference, though allowed the run of all the premises.
The kids are generally two in number; they are born in June.

YOUNG MALE ALPINE IBEX

The photograph shows the corrugated horns of the male.]

The ibex was long one of the chief objects of the Alpine hunter. The
Emperor Maximilian had a preserve of them in the Tyrol mountains near the
Aachen Sea; these he shot with a cross-bow when they were driven down the
mountains. Sometimes they were forced across the lake. A picture in his
private hunting-book shows the Emperor assisting to catch one in a net from
a boat. He notes that he once shot an ibex at a distance of 200 yards with
a cross-bow, after one of his companions had missed it with a gun, or
"fire-tube." When away on an expedition in Holland, he wrote a letter to
the wife of one of the most noted ibex-poachers on his domain, promising
her a silk dress if she could induce her husband to let the animals alone.
In the Himalaya the chief foes of the ibex are the snow-leopard and wild
dog.


THE MARKHOR.

The very fine Himalayan goat of this name differs from all other wild
species. The horns are spiral, like those of the kudu antelope and
Wallachian sheep. It may well be called the king of the wild goats. A buck
stands as much as 41 inches at the shoulder, and the maximum measurement of
the horns is 63 inches, or over 5 feet! It has a long beard and mane, and
stands very upright on its feet. Besides the Himalaya, it haunts the
mountains on the Afghan frontier. The markhor keep along the line between
the forest and snow, some of the most difficult ground in the hills. The
horns are a much-prized trophy.


THE TAHR.

The TAHR of the Himalaya is a very different-looking animal to the true
goats, from which, among other characters, it is distinguished by the form
and small size of the horns. The horns, which are black, spring in a high
backward arch, but the creature has no beard. A buck stands sometimes as
much as 38 inches high at the shoulder. It has a long, rough coat, mainly
dark stone-colour in tint.

[Illustration: _By permission of P. Thomas, Esq._

NUBIAN GOAT.

These goats come from Nubia and Upper Egypt. They are generally hornless
and short-haired; the colour varies, being sometimes black, and sometimes
tan and spotted.]

Tahr live in the forest districts of the Middle Himalaya, where they are
found on very high and difficult ground. General Donald Macintyre shot one
standing on the brink of an almost sheer precipice. Down this it fell, and
the distance in sheer depth was such that it was difficult to see the body
even with glasses. The tahr is fairly common all along the higher Himalayan
Range. Its bones are believed to be a sovereign cure for rheumatism, and
are exported to India for that object. A smaller kind is found in the
mountains of Eastern Arabia, where very few English sportsmen have yet
cared to attempt to shoot them.


THE NILGIRI TAHR, OR NILGIRI IBEX.

Though not an ibex, the sportsmen of India early gave this name to the tahr
of the Nilgiri and Anamalai Hills. The Himalayan species is covered with
long, shaggy hair; the South Indian has short, smooth brown hair.

"The ibex," says Hawkeye, the Indian sportsman, of this animal, "is
massively formed, with short legs, remarkably strong fetlocks, and a heavy
carcase, short and well ribbed up, combining strength and agility wonderful
to behold. Its habits are gregarious, and the does are seldom met with
separate from the flock or herd, though males often are. The latter assume,
as they grow old, a distinctive appearance. The hair on the back becomes
lighter, almost white in some cases, causing a kind of saddle to appear;
and from that time they become known to the shikaries as the saddle-backs
of the herd, an object of ambition to the eyes of the true sportsman. It is
a pleasant sight to watch a herd of ibex feeding undisturbed, the kids
frisking here and there on pinnacles or ledges of rock and beetling cliffs
where there seems scarcely safe hold for anything much larger than a
grasshopper, the old mother looking calmly on. Then again, see the caution
observed in taking up their resting- or abiding-places for the day, where
they may be warmed by the sun, listening to the war of many waters, chewing
the cud of contentment, and giving themselves up to the full enjoyment of
their nomadic life and its romantic haunts. Usually, before reposing, one
of their number, generally an old doe, may be observed gazing intently
below, apparently scanning every spot in the range of her vision, sometimes
for half an hour or more, before she is satisfied that all is well, but,
strange to say, seldom or never looking up to the rocks above. Then, being
satisfied on the one side, she follows the same process on the other, and
eventually lies down calmly, contented with the precautions she has taken.
Should the sentinel be joined by another, or her kid come and lie by her,
they always lie back to back, in such a manner as to keep a good look-out
to either side. A solitary male goes through all this by himself, and
wonderfully careful he is; but when with the herd he reposes in security,
leaving it to the female to take precautions for their joint safety."

ITALIAN GOAT.

From the earliest Roman days these goats have been the main form of
livestock kept by the mountaineers of the Apennines.]


ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT.

America possesses only one species of wild goat, the place of this genus
being taken in the southern part of the continent by the camel-like
guanacos. The ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT, the North American representative of the
group, is a somewhat anomalous creature. It has very few of the
characteristics of the European and Asiatic species. In place of being
active in body and vivacious in temperament, it is a quiet, lethargic
creature, able, it is true, to scale the high mountains of the North-west
and to live among the snows, but with none of the energetic habits of the
ibex or the tahr. In form it is heavy and badly built. It is heavy in front
and weak behind, like a bison. The eye is small, the head large, and the
shoulders humped. It feeds usually on very high ground; but hunters who
take the trouble to ascend to these altitudes find little difficulty in
killing as many wild goats as they wish. These goats are most numerous in
the ranges of British Columbia, where they are found in small flocks of
from three or four to twenty. Several may be killed before the herd is
thoroughly alarmed, possibly because at the high altitudes at which they
are found man has seldom disturbed them. None of the domesticated sheep or
goats of the New World are indigenous to the continent of America. It is a
curious fact, well worth studying from the point of view of the history of
man, that, with the exception of the llama, the dog, and perhaps the
guinea-pig, every domesticated animal in use from Cape Horn to the Arctic
Ocean has been imported. The last of these importations is the reindeer,
which, though the native species abounds in the Canadian woods, was
obtained from Lapland and Eastern Asia.

HIMALAYAN TAHR AND YOUNG.

The history of this effort at acclimatisation is curious, and may be quoted
in this connection. When the first rush to Klondike was made, the miners
were imprisoned and inaccessible during the late winter. The coming of
spring was the earliest period at which communication could be expected to
be restored, and even then the problem of feeding the transport animals was
a difficult one. The United States Government decided to try to open up a
road from Alaska by means of sledges drawn by reindeer, and the Canadian
Government devised a similar scheme. Agents were sent to Lapland and to the
tribes on the western side of Bering Sea, and deer, drivers, and harness
obtained from both. The deer were not used for the Klondike relief
expeditions by the Americans; but the animals and their drivers were kept
in Alaska, native reindeer were caught, and the latest news of the
experiment is that the deer were found very useful for carrying the mails
in winter.

CHAPTER XV.

_THE ANTELOPES._

BY F. C. SELOUS.

The TRUE ANTELOPES (including the Gazelles) are strictly confined to the
Old World, the Prongbuck of North America differing so much from all other
living ruminants, in its horn growth and other particulars, that it is
considered to be the sole representative of a distinct family.


THE HARTEBEESTS.

With the exception of one species--the Bubal--which is found both in North
Africa and Arabia, the HARTEBEESTS are entirely confined to the African
Continent. They are animals of large size, standing from 43 to 48 inches at
the shoulder, and are characterised by their long, narrow faces, high
withers, and doubly curved horns, which are present in both sexes. Nine
different species of this group are known to exist.

Although the ranges of these various species of hartebeest cover the
greater part of the African Continent, it is noteworthy that each species
keeps to its own ground, their several ranges but rarely overlapping.

All the hartebeests have a strong family resemblance, and are very similar
in their habits. They are never found either in dense forests or in swampy
or mountainous country, but are inhabitants of the arid deserts of Northern
and South-western Africa, and of the open grassy plains and thinly forested
regions of the high plateaux of the interior of that continent. They are
extraordinarily fleet and enduring, and in my own experience I have never
heard of one of these animals, of whatever species, having been overtaken
or ridden to a standstill by a man on horseback. They are very inquisitive,
and where they have not been molested will allow any unaccustomed
object--such as a European in clothes--to walk to within easy shot of them
before running off. They soon gain experience, however; and in countries
where they have been most persecuted hartebeests are the keenest-sighted
and the most wary of all African game. They are very fond of climbing to
the top of the large ant-heaps with which the plains of Africa are
profusely studded, and from this point of vantage surveying the surrounding
country. They live, I believe, entirely upon grass, and in the desert areas
of their range seem able to subsist for long periods without drinking
water. Their meat I have always thought very palatable. They are generally
in fairly good condition, though they seldom carry much fat. Their fat,
after being melted, becomes solid again immediately on cooling, and clogs
on the teeth whilst being eaten. But very few African species, except the
eland, ever become really fat; their life is too active, and the
food-supply too uncertain, for them to put on flesh like European deer.

[Illustration: _Photo by Miss E. J. Beck._

BUBALINE HARTEBEEST.

A small species, found in Syria as well as in North Africa.]


BONTEBOK AND BLESBOK GROUP.

Nearly allied to the hartebeests are certain other antelopes, of which it
will be sufficient to mention but two species--_viz._ the BONTEBOK and the
BLESBOK. These two antelopes, though doubtless distinct, since their points
of difference are constant and unvarying, are nevertheless so much alike,
and evidently so closely allied, that I look upon the former as a highly
coloured and specialised race of the latter. The blesbok once had a far
wider range than the bontebok, and ran in countless herds on the plains of
the northern districts of the Cape Colony, the Orange River Colony, the
Transvaal, Griqualand West, and British Bechuanaland, whilst the latter
animal has always been confined to the sandy wastes in the neighbourhood of
Cape Agulhas, the extreme southern point of Africa.

[Illustration: _Photo by Percy Ashenden_]     [_Cape Town._

BLESBOK.

A species formerly very numerous in South Africa, but now well-nigh
exterminated.]

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

WHITE-TAILED GNU AND CALF.

This "Wildebeest" is now believed to be practically exterminated as a wild
animal.]

I think it, however, not improbable that ages ago the blesbok ranged right
through Cape Colony to the sea-shore, and that subsequently the gradual
desiccation of the south-western portions of the country--which is still
continuing--or several years of continuous drought, caused the withdrawal
of the species northwards from the waterless parts of the country. Those,
however, which had reached the neighbourhood of Cape Agulhas, where there
is plenty of water, would have remained behind and formed an isolated race,
which, being influenced by local conditions, would naturally in course of
time have become differentiated from the parent stock. Be this as it may,
the bontebok of to-day is nothing but a glorified blesbok, being slightly
larger and more richly coloured than the latter animal. Its horns, too, are
always black, whilst those of the blesbok are of a greenish hue. When they
are in good condition, the coats of both these species of antelope, as well
as of the Sassaby, another member of this group, show a beautiful satiny
sheen, which plays over their purple-brown hides like shadows on sunlit
water.

The few bonteboks which still survive are now all preserved on large
enclosed farms; but their numbers are very small--less than 300, it is
believed. The farmers of Dutch descent now do their best to preserve rare
species on their land.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

A COW BRINDLED GNU.

This gnu, which is still found in great numbers in East Central Africa,
indulges in the same curious antics as the white-tailed species.]


THE GNUS.

These remarkable animals were once distributed throughout the greater part
of Africa from the Cape to Abyssinia, and their range is even now very
extensive, though what was once the most numerous and the most
eccentric-looking species of the group has almost ceased to exist.

The gnus are of large size, and at first sight appear to have the head of a
buffalo, the tail of a horse, and the limbs and hoofs of an antelope. Their
heads are very massive, with broad muzzles and widely separated, hairy
nostrils; their necks are maned, tails long and bushy, and both sexes carry
horns. They are known as "wilde beeste," or "wild cattle," to the Dutch
colonists of South Africa.

[Illustration: _Photo by Miss E. J. Beck._

RED-FLANKED DUIKER.

The duikers are for the most part diminutive and graceful antelopes, with
simple, spike-like horns.]

The WHITE-TAILED GNU, or BLACK WILDEBEEST, as it is more commonly called,
was once found in great numbers on the karroos of Northern Cape Colony, and
throughout the vast plains of the Orange River Colony, Transvaal,
Griqualand West, and British Bechuanaland. Its range, in fact, was coequal
with that of the blesbok. Even as lately as in 1875 and 1876 I personally
saw very considerable herds of these quaint animals in the Orange River
Colony and the Western Transvaal. When the present war broke out in 1899,
there were only two herds of black wildebeest left alive. These animals
numbered some 500 head altogether, and were protected by Dutch farmers.
There are probably very few of them left to-day, and it is scarcely
possible that this most interesting animal will long escape complete
extinction.

Black wildebeests, before they had been much persecuted, were so
inquisitive that, in the words of Gordon Cumming, they would "caper and
gambol" round a hunter's waggon or any other unusual object, and sometimes
approach to within a couple of hundred yards, when, whisking their long
white tails, they would gallop off with loud snorts. They were always,
however, very keen-sighted, and soon became extremely wary and almost
impossible to approach on foot in the open plains they frequented, whilst
their powers of endurance and fleetness of foot were such that they could
only be overtaken by a well-mounted hunter. In spite of these advantages,
however, the value of their skins, and the ever-increasing number of
hunters, armed with long-range rifles, practically brought about the
extermination of this species of gnu in a few decades.

The BRINDLED GNU is a larger animal than the last-named species, standing
4½ feet and upwards at the shoulder. This animal once ranged from the Vaal
River northwards, throughout Eastern and Central Africa, to the north of
Kilimanjaro, where its range overlaps that of a closely allied form, the
WHITE-BEARDED GNU, which is only found in certain districts of Eastern
Africa. In general habits these two varieties seem to be identical.

In the interior of Southern Africa, both north and south of the Zambesi, I
have met with very large numbers of BLUE WILDEBEESTS. They usually run in
herds of from ten to twenty individuals, but towards the end of the dry
season collect in droves of 200 or 300. They are often found in company
with zebras and sassaby antelopes. Their flesh resembles coarse beef, and,
to my thinking, is not ill-flavoured.

[Illustration: _Photo by Miss E. J. Beck._

KLIPSPRINGER.

The "cliff-jumper" is as active in its habits as a chamois, and is found in
most of the mountain-ranges of Africa.]


THE SMALLER BUCKS.

In addition to the great number of antelopes of large size which inhabit
the African Continent, there are also very many small species, the life
history and habits of some of which are as yet but imperfectly known, since
they are denizens of dense forests, and feed principally at night.

All these small African antelopes are divided into two sub-families. The
first comprises the African DUIKERS and the Indian FOUR-HORNED ANTELOPE,
and the second the DIK-DIKS, ORIBIS, KLIPSPRINGER, and certain other small
bush-antelopes.

The African duikers are distributed throughout Africa south of the Sahara,
and are represented by some twenty different species, the largest of which
approaches a small donkey in size, whilst the smallest is not much larger
than a hare.

The majority of these dainty little antelopes are inhabitants of the dense
tangled forests of the coast-belts of Africa, and are therefore but seldom
seen by travellers and sportsmen. One species of the group, however, the
COMMON DUIKER of South Africa, is a very well-known animal. This little
antelope inhabits much more open country than most of its congeners, and
has an enormous range, extending from Cape Agulhas to Somaliland, whilst
two very nearly allied forms are found in Senegal and Abyssinia
respectively.

SING-SING WATERBUCK.

The sing-sing and its relatives differ from the true waterbuck by the
absence of the white elliptical ring on the rump]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

MOUNTAIN REEDBUCK.

One of a group of small antelopes still common in many parts of Africa.]

In most species of duikers both sexes are horned, but in the case of the
common duiker it is very exceptional to find a female with horns, and in
all my experience I have only known of three such cases.

The FOUR-HORNED ANTELOPE is the Indian representative of the African
duikers, and is found along the foot of the Himalaya from the Punjab to
Nepal, and in suitable localities throughout the peninsula of India. It
frequents wooded hills, but avoids dense jungle. Like its nearest allies,
the duikers, it is solitary in its habits, more than two of these antelopes
seldom being seen together. The growth of four horns on the skull of this
antelope and on certain breeds of domesticated sheep is a curious fact
which has not roused as much comment as it deserves.

MALE IMPALA, OR PALLA.

The beautifully curved horns of the male palla form some of the most
graceful of trophies.]


THE KLIPSPRINGER.

Turning to the second sub-family, we may select the KLIPSPRINGER as the
most characteristic species to describe. This beautiful little animal,
which is often called the African Chamois, is found in suitable localities
from the Cape to Abyssinia. In the southern and northern portions of its
range the klipspringer is an inhabitant only of rugged mountain-ranges, and
ascends to a height of 9,000 or 10,000 feet above sea-level. In the more
central regions of its habitat, however, although it always lives amongst
rocks, and thoroughly justifies its name of "rock-jumper," it is often
found in regions where there are no high mountain-ranges. It used to be
very common in Matabililand, both in the Matopo Hills and on the isolated
granite kopjes which are so numerous in that country, and usually are not
more than 200 or 300 feet in height. In Mashonaland I have found it living
amongst granite rocks in the beds of the larger rivers, and actually on the
same level as the surrounding country; whereas on Wedza, a great
mountain-mass of slate and ironstone, which rises to a height of about
2,000 feet above the surrounding country, and to the top of which I once
climbed, I did not see any klipspringers. The hoofs of this little animal
are curiously different from those of any other African antelope, being
remarkably short and small, with very deep hollows. This adaptation to its
requirements enables the klipspringer to obtain a foothold on any small
projecting piece of rock, and to climb in a series of little jumps up the
faces of cliffs which seem almost perpendicular.

In height the klipspringer stands about 1 foot 9 inches at the shoulder.
The males alone carry horns, which are straight and ringed at the base, and
vary from 3 to 5 inches in length. The coat is of a greeny yellow-brown
colour, with the hairs hollow and brittle. These little animals are usually
met with singly, or in twos and threes together. When caught young, they
become wonderfully tame, and make the most charming pets, being very
playful and fond of jumping, with surprising ease and grace, from the floor
of a room on to any elevated position, such as a table, mantelpiece, or
window-sill.

MALE SAIGA ANTELOPES.

These antelopes inhabit the East Russian steppes. The thick woolly coat
turns nearly white in winter.]


THE WATERBUCKS.

The largest animals in the first of three groups now to be considered are
the WATERBUCKS, antelopes of stout and sturdy build, standing from 45 to 50
inches at the shoulder, and covered with long, coarse hair, especially on
the neck, in both sexes. The males alone carry horns, which vary from 20 to
36 inches in length, and are strongly ringed in front for three-fourths of
their length. They are sublyrate in shape, being first inclined backwards
and then forwards at the tips. There are three well-marked species of
waterbuck--_viz._ the COMMON WATERBUCK of South Africa, whose range extends
from the Limpopo northwards, through Nyasaland to German and British East
Africa, and to the Shebeyli River, in Somaliland; the SING-SING of Senegal
and Gambia; and the DEFASSA WATERBUCK of Western Abyssinia and the Nile
Valley, south to Uganda and British and German East Africa. In habits all
species of waterbuck are very similar. They live generally, though not
invariably, in herds of from ten to twenty individuals, and in such small
herds there is seldom more than one full-grown male present. In the
interior of South Africa the waterbuck is often met with amongst steep
stony hills and at a distance of more than a mile from the nearest river.
Speaking generally, however, this antelope may be said to frequent the near
neighbourhood of water, but to prefer dry to swampy ground. When chased by
dogs it always makes for water, and will plunge fearlessly into broad, deep
rivers, regardless of crocodiles, to which ravenous reptiles it sometimes
falls a victim. In South Africa waterbuck vary much in colour even in the
same district, some being reddish brown, whilst others are of a very dark
grey. The flesh of the waterbuck is coarse, and sometimes rather strongly
tasted, and when in good condition the fat is very hard.

The REEDBUCKS are similar in essential characters to the waterbucks, but
are of smaller size, and have more bushy tails, and naked spots on the
sides of the head beneath the ears.

Of this group the COMMON REEDBUCK of South Africa is the best known. This
animal stands 3 feet at the withers, and is of a soft greyish fawn-colour,
with a large fluffy tail, which is always thrown up when the animal runs,
exposing the white under-surface. The males alone carry horns, which curve
backwards and then forwards, and attain a length of from 12 to 16 inches.
Reedbucks are met with singly or in twos and threes, and never congregate
in herds, though I have seen us many as eight, belonging probably to three
or four families, feeding in close proximity to one another on young green
grass.

Another member of the reedbuck group is the ROOI RHEBUCK of South Africa.
This latter species, though a much smaller animal, is very similar to the
common reedbuck in colour, shape, and general appearance; it is quite
distinct in its habits and mode of life, as it lives in small herds of from
four or five to fifteen head, amongst rugged stony hills, often far from
water.


THE BLACKBUCK OF INDIA.

This handsome species is found throughout India wherever there are open
cultivated plains. The male stands about 32 inches at the shoulder, and
when full grown is of a glossy black colour, with the exception of a
chestnut-coloured patch at the back of the neck, and some markings of the
same colour about the face. The belly and insides of the limbs are pure
white, the line between the black and white being very clearly defined. The
whole body and frame are very compact, strong, and beautifully
proportioned, and the head is carried high. The males alone carry horns,
which are spiral in shape, annulated almost to the tips, and vary in length
from 18 to 28 inches. Young bucks and does are fawn-coloured instead of
black. These antelopes are usually met with in considerable herds on open
plains in which cultivated tracts alternate with waste land, and they often
do much damage to the natives' crops. When alarmed, they first execute a
series of prodigious bounds into the air before finally settling down to a
steady run. They are surprisingly fleet, and can seldom be overtaken by the
fastest greyhounds, although they can be caught and pulled down without
difficulty by trained cheetas, or, as they are often called,
hunting-leopards.

The PALLA, which is found in Southern and Eastern Africa from Bechuanaland
to Kordofan, is one of the most graceful of animals. It is a forest-loving
species, and is never found far from water. Both sexes are of a general
bright reddish brown, with white bellies. The males alone carry horns,
which are very graceful in shape, and vary from 14 to upwards of 20 inches
in length. The finest specimens of the palla are met with in the extreme
southerly and most northerly portions of its range, the animals inhabiting
the intermediate districts being smaller and carrying shorter horns. Pallas
are gregarious, living in herds of from twenty to over one hundred. When
alarmed, they bound over bushes or any other obstacles with the utmost ease
and grace, and appear to get over the ground at a high rate of speed. They
are, however, very commonly run down and torn to pieces by wild dogs, which
hunt in packs, and are very destructive to African game.

ARABIAN GAZELLE

Gazelles are some of the most slenderly built of all antelopes.]

Of far less graceful appearance than the two preceding species is the
SAIGA, which, though structurally closely allied to the gazelles, has been
placed by naturalists in a genus by itself.

This curious-looking animal, which is chiefly remarkable for its large
swollen-looking nose and light-coloured horns, is an inhabitant of the
steppes of South-eastern Europe and Western Asia. In height it stands about
30 inches at the withers, and is of a dull yellowish colour in summer,
turning to nearly white in winter. The males alone carry horns, which are
sometimes 13 or 14 inches long, and of a peculiar colour which has been
likened to pale amber.

At the present day the saiga is only found in Europe on the plains between
the Don and the Volga, but to the east of the Ural River its range extends
over the Kirghiz Steppes and the high plains of all Western Siberia. Living
in open country, and having the senses of hearing, sight, and scent all
highly developed, the saiga is a difficult animal to approach, and can only
be successfully stalked by an expert hunter. In summer it is usually met
with in small, scattered bands, which, when driven southwards by snow and
cold, are collected into considerable herds in the more southerly portions
of its range. In very severe winters whole herds have been known to perish
in snow-drifts, and in such inclement seasons large numbers are also killed
by the natives. The flesh of the saiga is said to resemble mutton, and is
held in much esteem.

GOITRED GAZELLES FROM MESOPOTAMIA.

These animals are inhabitants of rocky and desert ground. They are often
kept tame by the wandering Arabs.]


THE GAZELLES.

We now come to the Gazelles, among which are comprised many of the best
known and most beautiful of the small or medium-sized antelopes. In the
true gazelles both sexes generally carry horns. Indeed, this rule is
universal in those of Africa and Arabia; and there are only four species
known--all Asiatic--in which the females are hornless: _viz._ the TIBETAN
GAZELLE, PREJEVALSKI'S GAZELLE, the MONGOLIAN GAZELLE, and the PERSIAN
GAZELLE.

The range of the various species belonging to this large group is very
extensive, comprising the whole of Northern and Eastern Africa, Arabia, and
Western and Central Asia, as well as Mongolia and India. The gazelles are
inhabitants of the open plains and arid desert regions of the Old World,
and, although sometimes met with in tracts of country where there is a
certain amount of scattered bush or open stunted forest, are never found in
any kind of jungle or thick cover.

On the sandy plains of North-western Africa are found the RED-FRONTED
GAZELLE of Senegal and Gambia; the little-known MHORR GAZELLE of
South-western Morocco; and the DAMA GAZELLE, a species which has been known
to naturalists ever since the time of Buffon. A near ally of the last-named
animal is the RED-NECKED GAZELLE of Dongola and Senaar. In North-eastern
Africa are found the large and handsome SOEMMERRING'S GAZELLE; the ISABELLA
GAZELLE, of the coastlands of the Red Sea; HEUGLIN'S GAZELLE; PELZELN'S
GAZELLE, of the maritime plains of Northern Somaliland; and SPEKE'S
GAZELLE, of the interior of the same country; whilst, farther south the
group is represented by the large and beautiful GRANT'S GAZELLE, with its
allies PETERS'S GAZELLE and THOMSON'S GAZELLE. The well-known DORCAS
GAZELLE is an inhabitant of Morocco and Algeria, ranging through Egypt into
Palestine and Syria; the MARICA GAZELLE, the MUSCAT GAZELLE, and the
ARABIAN GAZELLE inhabit the deserts of Arabia; the EDMI GAZELLE is found in
the mountain-ranges of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis; while LODER'S GAZELLE
inhabits the sandy tracts of the interior of Algeria and Tunis. In Asia,
besides the four species of gazelle already enumerated in which the females
are hornless, one other member of the group is met with. This is the INDIAN
GAZELLE, a species very closely allied to the Arabian form.

Of the whole genus GRANT'S GAZELLE is the most beautiful. This handsome
animal, which was first discovered by the explorers Speke and Grant in
1860, is an inhabitant of Eastern Africa, from the neighbourhood of Lake
Rudolph southwards to Ugogo. In size the average height at the shoulder of
males of this species is about 34 inches. The coat is close and short and
of a general fawn colour, the rump and belly pure white, and the face
marked with a rufous band from the horns to the nose and with streaks of
white on each side. The upper surface of the tail is white, with a black
and tufted tip. The horns, which are very elegant in shape, being first
curved slightly forwards and then backwards, are much longer and more
powerful than in any other gazelle, and attain a length of 30 inches in the
males and 17 inches in the females.

GAZELLES FROM EGYPT.

Seen in great numbers when our troops crossed the Bayuda Desert.]

Grant's gazelles, though they undoubtedly find their most congenial home in
open country, have also been met with by recent travellers in
bush-sprinkled wastes and stony, rugged hills. They are, however, never
found in dense jungles or high mountains. They live in herds of from half a
dozen to twenty or thirty individuals, though in certain localities as many
as 200 have been seen together. They are fond of consorting with other
game, such as Burchell's and Grevy's zebras, Coke's hartebeest, and the
beisa oryx, and are often met with at long distances from the nearest
water. They are keen-sighted and wary, and from the open character of the
country in which they are usually encountered are often difficult to stalk.
When in good condition, the meat of this gazelle is said to be excellent.

The nearest ally of the true gazelles is undoubtedly the SPRINGBUCK of
South Africa. Owing to the protection which it has received of late years,
this graceful antelope is now a common animal in many parts of South
Africa, and in the north-western portions of the Cape Colony still
sometimes collects into prodigious herds, which travel through the country
in dense masses, destroying every vestige of grass on the line of their
advance, and causing considerable anxiety to farmers, whose flocks of sheep
and goats are sometimes swept away by the migrating springbucks. In former
years the migration of these antelopes in countless thousands from the
deserts of Namaqualand to the countries farther south was a common
occurrence, an unerring instinct guiding the wandering herds to districts
where rain had lately fallen and caused a new growth of green grass. The
animals composing these migrating herds were called by the Dutch settlers
of the Cape Colony "Trekbokken," or "travelling-bucks."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

RED-FRONTED GAZELLE.

Inhabits Dongola and Senaar.]

Two other antelopes, the DIBATAG and the GERENUK, are included in the
present group; but both, whilst typically gazelline in certain respects,
differ so much in other ways from all members of that group that each has
been placed in a separate genus.

The DIBATAG is a very remarkable-looking antelope, only found in certain
districts of Central Somaliland, where it was first discovered by Mr. T. W.
H. Clarke in 1890. This species shows the face-markings of the gazelles,
whilst the horns, which are only present in the males, much resemble in
shape those of a reedbuck. They are rather short, attaining a length of
only 11 or 12 inches, and their basal halves are strongly ringed in front.
The neck of this antelope is singularly long and thin, and the tail, which
is held curved forwards over the back when the animal is in motion, is also
much elongated, and only tufted at the tip. The dibatag frequents sandy
ground sparsely covered with low thorn-bushes, and lives in small families,
being usually met with in twos or threes, whilst it is rare to find more
than four or five consorting together.

RED-FRONTED GAZELLE.

Another view of the specimen shown above.]

The GERENUK, like the last-named animal, is an East African species, but
has a more extended range, being found all over Somaliland, and thence
southwards to the Tana Valley and the Kilimanjaro district of British East
Africa. The most remarkable external characteristic of this species is the
excessively long neck. The males alone carry horns, which attain an average
length of 12 or 13 inches, and, though somewhat gazelle-like in shape, are
more strongly crooked forwards at the points. The skull of this species is
more dense and solid in structure than in the true gazelles, and the
cheek-teeth are smaller in size.

Coming now to the Sable Antelope group, we find an assemblage of antelopes
which are all of large size and handsome appearance, and in all of which
both the males and females are horned. With the single exception of the
BEATRIX ORYX, which inhabits Arabia, all these antelopes are denizens of
Africa. One species of the group, the BLUEBUCK, which appears to have been
entirely confined to the mountainous districts of the Cape Peninsula,
became extinct during the first decade of the last century. Little is known
as to the life history of this animal, but it was undoubtedly nearly allied
to the larger and more handsomely marked ROAN ANTELOPE. This latter animal
once had a more extensive range than any other antelope, as it was found in
almost every part of Africa south of the Sahara, with the exception of the
Congo forest region. It has now been exterminated in the more southerly
portions of the country, but from the Limpopo to the Upper Nile, and thence
to the Niger, it is still to be found wherever the surroundings are
suitable to its requirements.

[Illustration: _Photo by Percy Ashenden_]     [_Cape Town._

MALE SPRINGBUCK.

Once the most numerous species in South Africa, where it is still not
uncommon. Its migrations, or "treks," at certain seasons were one of the
sights of the veldt.]

A large bull roan antelope will stand 4 feet 9 inches at the withers. The
general colour of the body differs in individuals, even in the same
district, varying from a very light shade of brown to dark grey or
red-roan. The front and sides of the face are jet-black in the adult male,
and dark reddish brown in the female, with two long white tufts of hair
under the eyes. The muzzle and extremity of the lower jaw are white. The
hair on the under side of the neck is long and coarse, and a stiff mane
about 3 inches in length runs from behind the ears to the withers. The ears
are very long, and in the females and young males tufted. The horns are
curved backwards, and in the male are very stout and strong, attaining a
length of from 26 to 34 inches. In the female the horns are shorter and
slighter, and not so strongly ringed.

Roan antelope are usually met with in small herds of from six to a dozen
members, and never congregate in large numbers. I do not think I have ever
counted as many as thirty together. I have found them fairly common in
certain districts, but nowhere very plentiful. They frequent open plains
and thinly forested country, and are never found far away from water. Bucks
often become savage when wounded, and will sometimes charge viciously if
approached incautiously. They can use their horns with great dexterity, and
play havoc with a pack of dogs.

SABLE ANTELOPE.

A near ally of the Roan Antelope, from which it is broadly distinguished by
its striking coloration--black and white.]

The SABLE ANTELOPE, though considerably smaller than the roan, is yet a
handsomer animal. In colour the adult male, when in high condition, is
jet-black all over with the exception of the white face-markings and the
snow-white of the belly and insides of the thighs. The mane is longer and
more bushy than in the roan antelope, and often hangs down on either side
over the withers. The horns, too, are much finer, and, sweeping backwards
in a bold curve, are commonly upwards of 42 inches long, and have been
known to reach 50 inches. The striking colour, large size, and horns of
this creature make it one of the most-prized trophies of the sportsman. The
skin, when prepared and laid down as a rug in halls or dwelling-rooms, is
far more handsome than that of any deer. The female of this species is
usually of a rich red-brown in colour instead of black as in the male.
South of the Zambesi, however, old cows become almost absolutely black.
North of the Zambesi both male and female sable antelopes are dark red in
colour rather than black. The horns in the female are slighter and less
curved than in the male, and are also considerably shorter, as a rule not
measuring over 30 inches in length.

The range of the sable antelope extends from the northern districts of the
Transvaal to German East Africa. In the country between the Limpopo and the
Central Zambesi it used to be a very common animal, especially in the
northern districts of Mashonaland. It is partial to open forests
intersected by grassy, well-watered glades, and is never found on open
plains entirely devoid of bush. It is usually met with in herds of from
twelve to twenty individuals, but I have often seen as many as fifty, and
once counted between seventy and eighty together. However large a herd of
sable antelopes may be, it is very exceptional to find with it more than
one fully adult male, from which fact I should judge that these animals are
of a very jealous and pugnacious disposition. When wounded and brought to
bay by dogs, a sable antelope defends itself with the utmost fury, using
its long scimitar-shaped horns with most wonderful quickness and dexterity.
If badly wounded it will lie down, otherwise it fights standing. Keeping
its face to some of its foes, with a sideways twist of its head it will
transfix and throw into the air any dog which attempts to attack it from
behind. I have seen a wounded sable antelope, when lying down, drive one of
its horns clean through a large dog deep into its own haunch, and I have
had four valuable hounds killed and four others grievously wounded by one
of these animals in less than a minute. I once knew a native hunter who was
stabbed through the kidneys and killed by a sable antelope cow.

ROAN ANTELOPE.

In common with the Sable Antelope and the Oryx group, both sexes of this
species carry horns.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Norman B. Smith, Esq._

MALE OF GRANT'S GAZELLE.

This fine East African species is one of the handsomest of its kind.]

The nearest allies of the sable and roan antelopes are the various species
of the genus Oryx. In this group are included the WHITE ORYX, which
inhabits the desert regions of the interior of Northern Africa from Dongola
to Senegal; the BEATRIX ORYX of Southern Arabia; the GEMSBUCK of
South-western Africa; the BEISA, which is found in North-east Africa from
Suakim southwards to the river Tana; and the TUFTED BEISA, which is very
nearly related to the last-named species, whose place it takes south of the
Tana River in certain districts of British and German East Africa. In
general appearance there is a strong family resemblance between the
different species of oryx. In all of them both sexes carry horns, which are
considerably longer, though somewhat slighter, in the females than in the
males. In the white oryx the horns are curved backwards; but in the other
four species they are straight, or nearly so. In all the faces are
conspicuously banded with black and white, and the tails long, with large
dark terminal brushes. The two most desert-loving species, the white and
the Beatrix oryx, are paler in general body-colour than the other three,
and the latter animal is considerably smaller than any other member of the
group, standing not more than 35 inches at the withers. The gemsbuck is the
largest and undoubtedly the handsomest of the group, standing 4 feet at the
shoulders; the horns of the females are often upwards of 40 inches long,
and have been known to attain a length of 48 inches.

[Illustration: GROUP OF BEISA ORYX.

This most interesting photograph, taken by Lord Delamere, shows a group of
these fine antelopes on the East African plains.]

In habits all species of oryx seem to be very similar. They are denizens of
the arid sun-scorched plains of Africa, which are not necessarily devoid of
all kind of vegetation, but are often covered with stunted bush, and carry
a plentiful crop of coarse grass after rain. Oryx usually run in herds of
from four or five to fifteen or twenty, though the beisa, the most abundant
of the group, has been met with in troops numbering 400 or 500 head. All
the oryx are shy and wary, and in the open country they usually frequent
are difficult to approach on foot. If pursued on horseback, they run at a
steady gallop, which they can maintain for long distances, swinging their
bushy black tails from side to side, and holding their heads in such a way
that their long straight horns are only sloped slightly backwards. Fleet
and enduring, however, as oryx undoubtedly are, I am of opinion that in
these respects the gemsbuck of South Africa, at any rate, is inferior to
all other large antelopes living in the same country, with the single
exception of the eland. I have often, when mounted on a fast horse,
galloped right up to herds of gemsbuck, and on two occasions have run
antelopes of this species to an absolute standstill. Oryx of all species
should be approached with caution when badly wounded, as they are liable to
make short rushes, and can use their horns with great effect.

Nearly related to the antelopes of the Oryx group in many essential
characteristics, yet at once distinguishable by its spiral horns and broad
reindeer-like feet, the desert-haunting ADDAX has been placed in a separate
genus, of which it is the sole representative.

This remarkable animal stands about 38 inches in height at the withers, and
varies in general colour at different seasons of the year, from brownish
grey to a reddish hue. The forehead is covered with a thick growth of bushy
black hair, beneath which there is a patch of white extending across the
nose to under the eyes. The hindquarters, tail, and legs are white. The
horns are spiral, and are present in both sexes. In the male they attain a
length of about 28 inches in a straight line, and almost 36 inches
following the spiral. In the female they are thinner and less spirally
curved. The addax is confined to the desert regions of Northern Africa from
Dongola to Senegal, and the broad, rounded hoofs, so unlike those of any
other antelope, would seem to show that it inhabits countries where the
soil is deep, soft sand.

BEISA ORYX.

The beisa is found in North-east Africa; by some it is believed to have
suggested the original idea of the unicorn.]

Very little is known of the life history or habits of this antelope. It is
said to associate in pairs or small herds, and to be entirely independent
of water, though it travels great distances over the desert in the track of
thunder-storms for the sake of the young herbage which grows so quickly
wherever rain falls in those thirsty regions. It is killed in considerable
numbers by the Arabs for the sake of its flesh and hide, and is either
stalked or hunted on horseback, with the help of greyhounds, by Europeans.

The last of the sub-families into which modern naturalists have divided the
antelopes of the world comprises some of the handsomest species of the
whole group, and includes the largest of all antelopes, the Eland, as well
as such small and beautifully marked creatures as the Harnessed Bushbucks.

With one exception--the Nilgai--all the members of this sub-family are
denizens of the great African Continent.

The NILGAI, or BLUE BULL, is an inhabitant of India, and is found
throughout the greater portion of the peninsula, from the base of the
Himalaya to the south of Mysore. It is an animal of large size, standing
about 4 feet 6 inches at the shoulder. In general colour the male is of a
dark iron-grey, the female tawny fawn. White spots on the cheeks and just
above the hoofs on the fore and hind feet are the outward signs of its
affinity to the African harnessed antelopes. The male alone carries horns,
which are nearly straight and very small for the size of the animal, rarely
exceeding 9 inches in length.

Passing now to the Harnessed Antelopes of Africa, our attention is first
claimed by the BUSHBUCKS. Excluding the Inyala and the Broad-horned
Antelope, we find several forms of the smaller bushbucks recognised by
naturalists: _viz._ the HARNESSED ANTELOPE of the forest regions of Western
Africa; the CAPE BUSHBUCK of South Africa; CUMMING'S BUSHBUCK of Eastern
Africa; and the DECULA BUSHBUCK of Abyssinia. The various forms of bushbuck
vary in general colour from very dark brown to various shades of
grey-brown, yellow-brown, and rich red. In all species the young are more
or less striped and spotted; but whereas in some forms the adult animals
lose their stripes and spots almost entirely, in others the adults are more
richly marked than immature specimens. For my part, I am inclined to
believe that, if large series of bushbuck-skins were collected from every
district throughout Africa, it would be found that all the varieties of
this animal at present accepted as distinct species would be found to grade
into one another in such a way that only one true species could be
recognised.

GERENUK.

A gazelle-like antelope with long neck and legs, inhabiting North-east
Africa.]

The bushbucks vary in height at the shoulder from 28 inches to 33 inches,
and only the males carry horns, which are nearly straight, with a close
spiral twist, and measure in adult animals from 10 inches to 18 inches in
length.

Bushbucks are not found in open country, but live in forest or thick bush
near the bank of a river, stream, or lake, and are never met with far from
water. They are very partial to wooded ravines amongst broken, mountainous
country, provided such districts are well watered; and are very solitary in
their habits, both males and females being usually found alone, though the
latter are often accompanied by a kid or half-grown animal. They are shy
and retiring, and should be looked for between daylight and sunrise, or
late in the evening, as they are very nocturnal in their habits, and lie
concealed in long grass or thick bush during the heat of the day. Their
call resembles the bark of a dog, and may often be heard at nights.

The BROAD-HORNED ANTELOPE is only found in the forests of the West African
coast range, from Liberia to Gaboon. The male of this species is a very
handsome animal, standing about 43 inches at the withers, and is a bright
chestnut-red in general colour, with a white spinal stripe extending from
the withers to the root of the tail, and fourteen or fifteen white stripes
on the shoulders, flanks, and hindquarters. The ears are large and rounded,
and the horns very massive, and about 30 inches in length, measured over
the single spiral twist. There are two or three large white spots on the
cheeks, and a broad white arrow-shaped mark across the nose below the eyes.
The female is similar in coloration to the male, but smaller and hornless.

Little or nothing is known as to the habits of this very beautiful
antelope. Du Chaillu, who met with it in the interior of Gaboon between
1856 and 1859, says that it is "very shy, swift of foot, and exceedingly
graceful in its motions"; but he does not tell us whether it lives in pairs
like the bushbucks, or in small herds like some of its other near allies.

Unfortunately, the specimen from which this photograph was taken had lost
its splendid spiral horns.]

The INYALA is another bush-loving antelope closely allied to the bushbucks.
In this species the general colour of the adult male is a deep dark grey,
that of the female and young male bright yellow-red, and both sexes are
beautifully striped with narrow white bands on the body and haunches. In
the male long dark hair hangs from the throat, chest, and each side of the
belly, and fringes the front of the thigh almost to the hock, and the back
of it up to the root of the tail. The ears are large and rounded; and the
horns, which are only present in the male, attain a length of about 2 feet
in a straight line, and 30 inches along their spiral curve. The standing
height at the shoulder of males of this species is about 42 inches.

This most beautiful antelope has a very restricted range, being only found
in a narrow belt of coastland extending from St. Lucia Bay to the Sabi
River, in South-east Africa, and in a still smaller area in the
neighbourhood of the Upper Shiri River, in British Central Africa.

Before the acquisition of firearms by the natives in South-east Africa, the
inyala was very plentiful in Northern Zululand and Amatongaland, and was
then to be met with in herds of from ten to twenty individuals; whilst the
males, which at certain seasons of the year separated from the females,
were in the habit of consorting together in bands of from five to eight.
Constant persecution by the natives in Amatongaland and the countries
farther north very much reduced the numbers of inyalas in those districts a
long time ago; but in Zululand, where this animal has been strictly
protected by the British authorities for the last twenty years, it was
still plentiful up to 1896, when the rinderpest swept over the country, and
committed such sad ravages amongst all the tragelaphine antelopes that it
is to be feared the inyala can now no longer be found anywhere in any
considerable numbers. Where I met with these antelopes some years ago, in
the country to the south of Delagoa Bay, I found them living either alone
or in pairs like bushbucks. They frequented dense thickets in the immediate
neighbourhood of a river or lagoon, and I never saw one in anything like
open country or far away from water. Their tracks showed me that at night
they were accustomed to feed in open spaces in the bush, but they always
retired to the jungle again at daylight, as they had become very wary and
cunning through constant persecution at the hands of the natives.

NORTHERN GIRAFFE.

Two distinct types of Giraffe exist: the northern form, which has a large
third horn, may be described as a chocolate-coloured animal marked with a
network of fine buff lines; the southern form, in which the third horn is
small, is fawn coloured with irregular brown blotches.]

Closely allied to the bush-antelopes of the present group are the
swamp-haunting SITATUNGAS. Three species of these have been described,--one
from East Africa, named after Captain Speke; another from tropical West
Africa; and a third from Lake Ngami and the Chobi River, named after the
present writer.

[Illustration: _Photo by Mr. W. Rau_]     [_Philadelphia._

A PAIR OF YOUNG PRONGBUCKS.

From the fact that the horns of the males are annually shed, the prongbuck
is assigned to a group apart from the Antelopes.]

There is very little difference between the adult males of these three
species, except that in the West African form the coat is of a darker
colour than in the other two. The main difference consists in the fact
that, whereas the female of Selous' sitatunga is light brown in colour like
the male, and the newly born young are very dark blackish brown (the colour
of a mole), beautifully striped and spotted with pale yellow, the female
and young of the other two forms are red in ground-colour, with white spots
and stripes. However, personally I am of opinion that there is only one
true species of sitatunga in all Africa, and that the differences between
the various forms are superficial, and would be found to grade one into the
other, if a sufficiently large series of skins of all ages and both sexes
could be gathered together from all parts of the continent. In the Barotse
Valley, on the Upper Zambesi, my friend Major R. T. Coryndon informs me
that both red and brown female sitatungas are met with. On the Lower Chobi
and Lake Ngami region the females are never red, but always of the same
brown colour as the males, whilst on the Congo all the females are red.

The male sitatunga stands about 3 feet 6 inches at the shoulder, and varies
in general colour in different localities from light to dark brown. The
adult females are either red with a few faint stripes and spots, or light
brown, only retaining very faint traces of any stripes or spots. The young
are, both in tropical West and Central East Africa, red, striped, and
spotted with white; but in South-west Africa dark blackish brown, with
spots and stripes of yellowish white. The hoofs are excessively long, and
the skin which covers the back of the pastern is hairless, and of a very
thick and horny consistency. The males alone carry horns, which are of the
same character as in the inyala, but more spiral and longer, having been
known to attain a length of 28 inches in a straight line and 35 inches over
the curve.

The sitatunga is an inhabitant of the extensive swamps which exist in many
parts of the interior of Africa. It may be said to live in the water, as it
passes its life in flooded beds of reeds and papyrus, into the muddy
bottoms of which its long hoofs, when splayed out, prevent it from sinking.
When forced out into dry ground by heavy floods, the formation of its feet
so hinders it in running that it can be overtaken and speared by a native
on foot. I was informed by the natives on the Chobi River that, when the
floods enabled them to paddle their canoes through the reed-beds, they
often killed considerable numbers of the sitatungas. These animals, they
said, when they saw a canoe approaching, would often not attempt to seek
safety by flight, but would sink down in the water, submerging their whole
bodies, and leaving only their nostrils above the surface, and in this
position were easily speared.

The sitatunga is not gregarious, but is met with singly or in pairs. The
hair is long, but soft and silky; and the skins are much sought after by
the natives for blankets.

In addition to the bushbucks and sitatungas, two more very notable
spiral-horned African antelopes remain to be mentioned--namely, the GREATER
KUDU and the LESSER KUDU.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

HARNESSED ANTELOPE.

A very beautiful species, in which the ground-colour of the coat is a rich
chestnut, while the spots and stripes are pure white.]

The GREATER KUDU is one of the most magnificent-looking of the whole family
of antelopes, and is an animal of large size, an adult male standing 4 feet
9 inches and upwards at the withers. The general colour of this species is
light brown to dark grey, the old males looking much darker than females or
younger animals, because the scantiness of their coats shows the dark
colour of the skin beneath. On each side of the body and hind-quarters
there are several white stripes, which vary in number from four to eight or
nine. As in all this group of antelopes, there are two or three
cheek-spots, as well as an arrow-shaped white mark across the nose, below
the eyes. In the male there is a slight mane on the back of the neck, and a
fringe of long white and blackish-brown hair intermixed, extending from the
throat to the chest. The ears are very large and rounded, and the male is
adorned with magnificent spiral horns, which have been known to attain a
length of 48 inches in a straight line from base to tip, and 64 inches over
the curve.

The greater kudu once had a very wide range, which extended from the
central portions of the Cape Colony to Angola on the west, and on the east
throughout East Africa up to Abyssinia; but, with the single exception of
the buffalo, no species of wild animal suffered more from the terrible
scourge of rinderpest which recently swept over the continent than this
lordly antelope, and it has almost ceased to exist in many districts of
South and South Central Africa, where up to 1896 it was still very
numerous.

[Illustration: _Photo by Percy Ashenden_]     [_Cape Town._

MALE KUDU.

A kudu bull stands about 5 feet or a little more at the withers, being in
size only inferior to the eland. The horns form a corkscrew-like spiral.]

The greater kudu is a bush-loving antelope, and very partial to wooded
hills, though it is also plentiful in the neighbourhood of rivers which
flow through level tracts of country covered with forest and bush. In my
own experience it is never found at any great distance from water. It eats
leaves and wild fruits as well as grass, and lives in small herds or
families, never, I believe, congregating in large numbers. In Southern
Africa, at any rate, it was always exceptional to see more than twenty
greater kudus together, and I have never seen more than thirty. At certain
seasons of the year the males leave the females, and live alone or several
together. I once saw nine magnificently horned kudus standing on the bank
of the Chobi, and I have often seen four or five males of this species
consorting together. As a rule the greater kudu is met with in hilly
country or in bush so dense that a horse cannot gallop through it at full
speed; but if met with in open ground, a good horse can overtake an old
male without much difficulty. The females are much lighter and faster, and
cannot be overtaken in any kind of ground.

The greater kudu is one of the most timid and inoffensive of animals, and
when attacked by dogs will not make the slightest attempt to defend itself
either with its horns or by kicking.

The LESSER KUDU in general colour nearly resembles its larger relative, but
is much smaller, the males only standing about 40 inches at the withers,
and it lacks the long fringe of hair under the throat. The white stripes on
the body and hindquarters are, however, more numerous--from eleven to
fourteen; and the horns, which are only present in the males, are less
divergent, and with the spiral curvature much closer than in the greater
kudu.

The lesser kudu is an inhabitant of Somaliland and the maritime districts
of British East, Africa. It frequents thick scrubby jungle, and is said to
be exceedingly watchful and wary. It lives either in pairs or in small
families, but never congregates in large herds. Like all the tragelaphine
antelopes, this species is a leaf-eater, and feeds principally during the
night, lying up in thick bush during the heat of the day.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

ELAND.

A feature of the eland is the large "dewlap." Unlike the kudu, both sexes
are horned.]

There remains to be mentioned but one other group of antelopes, the ELANDS,
large, heavily built animals, which belong to the present group, but differ
from all species of kudu, sitatunga, and bushbuck, inasmuch as both sexes
are horned. There are two forms of the COMMON ELAND--namely, the grey
variety of South-western Africa, and the striped animal, which is found in
the countries farther north and east. The two forms grade one into the
other, and are absolutely identical in their habits and mode of life, the
differences between them being merely superficial. To the south of the
twenty-third parallel of south latitude all elands are of a uniform fawn
colour, except the old animals, which look dark grey, from the fact that
the scantiness of their coats allows the dark colour of the skin to show
through the hair. Old males, when standing in the shade of a tree, appear
to be of a deep blue-grey in colour, and are known to the colonists of
South Africa as "blue bulls." In Rhodesia, South-east Africa, and the
countries to the north of the Zambesi, all the elands are bright
chestnut-red when young, with a black line down the centre of the back from
the withers to the tail, broad black patches on the backs of the fore legs
above the knees, and eight or nine white stripes on each side. When they
grow old, the ruddiness of the ground-colour gradually fades, the black
markings on the fore legs die out, and the white stripes become
indistinguishable at a short distance, the old bulls looking deep blue-grey
in general colour. Every intermediate stage of colouring between the
unstriped and the highly coloured forms of eland is to be found in the
district lying between the central portions of the Kalahari Desert and the
Zambesi River. Old male elands south of the Zambesi develop a growth of
long, bristly black hair on the forehead, which often hangs over their eyes
and extends half-way down their noses. North of the Zambesi this growth of
hair is not nearly so luxuriant.

I have carefully measured the standing height at the withers of many old
male elands in the interior of South Africa, and found that it varied from
5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 10 inches. The horns of bulls in their prime
measure from 26 inches to 33 inches in length, but old bulls wear their
horns down very much. The cows carry longer, though thinner horns than the
bulls.

The range of the eland once extended from Cape Agulhas to the White Nile,
but it has become extinct in many districts of Southern Africa, and in
almost every other portion of its range has, like all other tragelaphine
antelopes, suffered so cruelly from the recent visitation of rinderpest
that it has now become a scarce animal all over Africa.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

ELAND COWS.

Female elands carry longer, although more slender horns than the bulls.]

During the rainy season elands are usually met with in small herds of from
four or five to ten individuals; but towards the end of the dry season they
collect into large herds, and at such times I have often seen from fifty to
over two hundred of these animals in one troop.

In my experience elands live for two-thirds of the year in forest or
bush-covered country, or amongst rugged hills; and in such localities they
are difficult to overtake on horseback; but in the middle of the dry
season, as soon as they smell the smoke of the grass fires lighted by the
natives on the open plateaux, they leave their retreats, and, collecting in
herds, wander out on to the treeless plains in search of young grass. They
then fall an easy prey to a mounted hunter, especially the heavy old bulls,
which can be run to a standstill with ease by a very moderate horse.

The flesh of the eland is excellent when the animal is in good condition,
as at such a time these animals become very fat, especially the old bulls,
whose hearts become encased in a mass of fat which will often weigh 20 lbs.
It is a mistake, however, to think that eland-meat is always good; for
towards the end of the dry season, when there is little grass to be got,
they feed extensively on the leaves of certain bushes, and their meat at
such times becomes very poor and tasteless.

Besides the common eland of Southern, Central, and Eastern Africa, another
distinct species is met with in Senegal and the Gambia Colony. This is the
DERBIAN ELAND, about which animal our knowledge is still very slight, as I
believe that it has never yet been shot nor its habits studied by a
European traveller. A good many skulls and horns and a few skins have been
obtained from natives, from which it appears that in general colour this
species is of a rich reddish-fawn colour, becoming nearly white below, the
middle of the belly being black. The neck is covered with long hair of a
dark brown or black colour, blacker towards the shoulder than in front. A
broad black stripe extends all down the centre of the back from the neck to
the root of the tail, and there are large black patches on the backs and
inner sides of the fore legs above the knees. On each side of the body and
haunches there are thirteen or fourteen narrow white stripes. The horns are
larger and more massive and divergent than in the common eland.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

BULL ELAND.

The flesh of the eland is of better flavour than that of most other large
game. If sheltered in winter, the species will thrive in English parks.]

The Derbian eland is said to be a forest-loving animal, never of its own
accord coming out into the plains. It lives in small herds, is very shy and
not at all abundant, and browses on the leaves and young shoots of various
trees and bushes.

CHAPTER XVI.

_THE GIRAFFE AND OKAPI._

THE GIRAFFE.

BY H. A. BRYDEN.

Giraffes, which are found only in the continent of Africa, are the tallest
of all living creatures. They belong to the Ruminants, or Cud-chewers, and
naturalists are inclined to place them somewhere between the Deer Family
and the Hollow-horned Ruminants, in which latter are to be found oxen,
buffaloes, and antelopes. Rütimeyer, the Swiss naturalist, once defined
them as "a most fantastic form of deer," which is, perhaps, as good a
definition of them as one is likely to hit upon. Fossil discoveries show
that, in ages long remote, great giraffe-like creatures, some of them
bearing horns or antlers, roamed widely in the south of Europe, Persia,
India and even China.

[Illustration: _Photo by Miss E. J. Beck._

SOUTHERN GIRAFFE LYING DOWN.

This giraffe was a present to Queen Victoria; it only lived fourteen days
after its arrival.]

Of living giraffes, two species have thus far been identified,--the
SOUTHERN or CAPE GIRAFFE, with a range extending from Bechuanaland and the
Transvaal to British East Africa and the Soudan; and the NUBIAN or NORTHERN
GIRAFFE, found chiefly in East Africa, Somaliland, and the country between
Abyssinia and the Nile. The southern giraffe, which, from its recent
appearance in the Gardens of the Zoological Society, is now the more
familiar of the two animals, has a creamy or yellowish-white ground-colour,
marked by irregular blotches, which vary in colour, in animals of different
ages, from lemon-fawn to orange-tawny, and in older specimens to a very
dark chestnut. Old bulls and occasionally old cows grow extremely dark with
age, and at a distance appear almost black upon the back and shoulders. The
northern giraffe is widely different, the coloration being usually a rich
red-chestnut, darker with age, separated by a fine network of white lines,
symmetrically arranged in polygonal patterns. At no great distance this
giraffe, instead of having the blotchy or dappled appearance of the
southern giraffe, looks almost entirely chestnut in colour. Again, the
southern giraffe has only two horns, while the northern species usually
develops a third, growing from the centre of the forehead. These horns,
which are covered with hair in both species, and tufted black at the tips,
are, in the youthful days of the animal, actually separable from the bones
of the head. As the animal arrives at maturity, they become firmly united
to the skull. A third race or sub-species of giraffe has been identified in
Western Africa, mainly from the skull and cannon-bones of a specimen shot
in 1897 at the junction of the Binue and Niger Rivers; but very little is
known about this form. Other varieties or sub-species may yet be discovered
in other parts of the Dark Continent. It is lacking in the giraffe's long
neck.

The towering height of the giraffe is entirely attributable to the great
length of the neck and limbs. A full-grown bull giraffe will certainly
measure occasionally as much as 19 feet in height. I measured very
carefully a specimen shot by my hunting friend, Mr. W. Dove, in the forests
of the North Kalahari, South Africa, which taped 18 feet 11½ inches. A fine
cow, shot by myself in the same country, measured 16 feet 10 inches, and
there is no reason to suppose that cow giraffes do not easily reach fully
17 feet in height. These animals feed almost entirely upon the leaves of
acacia-trees, the foliage of the _kameel-doorn_, or giraffe-acacia,
affording their most favourite food-supply. It is a most beautiful
spectacle to see, as I have seen, a large troop of these dappled
giants--creatures which, somehow, viewed in the wild state, always seem to
me to belong to another epoch--quietly browsing, with upstretched necks and
delicate heads, among the branches of the spreading _mokala_, as the
Bechuanas call this tree.

The giraffe's upper lip is long and prehensile, and covered, no doubt as a
protection against thorns, with a thick velvety coating of short hair. The
tongue is long--some 18 inches in length--and is employed for plucking down
the tender leafage on which the giraffe feeds. The eyes of the giraffe are
most beautiful--dark brown, shaded by long lashes, and peculiarly tender
and melting in expression. Singularly enough, the animal is absolutely
mute, and never, even in its death-agonies, utters a sound. The hoofs are
large, elongate, nearly 12 inches in length in the case of old bulls, and
look like those of gigantic cattle. There are no false hoofs, and the
fetlock is round and smooth. The skin of a full-grown giraffe is
extraordinarily tough and solid, attaining in the case of old males as much
as an inch in thickness. From these animals most of the _sjamboks_, or
colonial whips, in use all over South Africa, are now made; and it is a
miserable fact to record that giraffes are now slaughtered by native and
Boer hunters almost solely for the value of the hide, which is worth from
£3 to £5 in the case of full-grown beasts. So perishes the giraffe from
South Africa.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

MALE SOUTHERN GIRAFFE.

The coloration of these animals harmonises exactly with the dark and light
splashes of their surroundings.]

Giraffes live mainly in forest country, or country partially open and
partially clothed with thin, park-like stretches of low acacia-trees. When
pursued, they betake themselves to the densest parts of the bush and
timber, and, their thick hides being absolutely impervious to the frightful
thorns with which all African jungle and forest seem to be provided, burst
through every bushy obstacle with the greatest ease. They steer also in the
most wonderful manner through the timber, ducking branches and evading
tree-boles with marvellous facility. I shall never forget seeing my hunting
comrade after his first chase in thick bush. We had ridden, as we always
rode hunting, in our flannel shirts, coatless. Attracted by his firing, I
came up with my friend, who was sitting on the body of a huge old bull
giraffe, which had fallen dead in a grassy clearing. He was looking
ruefully at the remains of his shirt, which hung about him, literally in
rags and ribbons. Blood was streaming from innumerable wounds upon his
chest, neck, and arms. Always after that we donned cord coats, when running
giraffes in bush and forest country.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rutland & Sons._

A GIRAFFE GRAZING.

Grazing is evidently not the natural mode of feeding of these animals,
which are essentially browsers.]

In regions where they have been little disturbed, giraffes no doubt wander
across open plains, and are to be seen well away from the denser forests,
feeding among scattered islets of acacias, easily exposed to the human eye.
But in South Africa they are now seldom to be met with out of the forest
region. Once, and once only, have I seen giraffes in the open. This was on
the outskirts of the forest, and the great creatures had been tempted to a
little knoll of _mokala_ trees, rising like an islet from the sea of grass.

One's first impression of these creatures in the wild state is very
deceptive. I well remember first setting eyes upon a troop of five or six.
As they swung away from the leafage on which they were feeding, my friend
and I cantered easily, thinking that we should soon come up with them. We
were completely deceived. With those immense legs of theirs, the great
creatures, going with their easy, shuffling, but marvellously swift walk,
were simply striding away from us. Discovering our mistake, we rode hard,
and the giraffes then broke into their strange, rocking gallop, and a
headlong, desperate chase began, to be terminated by the death of a fine
cow. Like the camel, the giraffe progresses by moving the two legs upon
either side of the body simultaneously. At this strange, rocking gallop
these animals move at a great pace, and a good Cape horse is needed to run
into them. By far the best plan, if you are bent on shooting these animals,
is to press your pony, so soon as you sight giraffes, to the top of its
speed, and force the game beyond its natural paces in one desperate gallop
of a couple of miles or so. If well mounted, your nag will take you right
up to the heels of the tall beasts, and, firing from the saddle, you can,
without great difficulty, bring down the game. The giraffe, unlike the
antelopes of Africa, is not very tenacious of life, and a bullet planted
near the root of the tail will, penetrating the short body, pierce a vital
spot, and bring down the tall beast crashing to earth. Having tasted the
delights of fox-hunting and many other forms of sport, I can testify that
the run up to a good troop of giraffes is one of the most thrilling and
exciting of all human experiences. There is nothing else quite like it in
the wide range of sporting emotions. Having enjoyed this thrilling pleasure
a few times, however, the humane hunter will stay his hand, and shoot only
when meat, or perhaps an exceptionally fine specimen, is absolutely needed.
Giraffes are, of course, utterly defenceless, and, save for their shy, wary
habits and remote, waterless habitat, have nothing to shield them from the
mounted hunter.

Giraffe-hunting on foot is a very different matter. In that case the
giraffe has the better of it, and the stalker is placed at great
disadvantage. These animals are in many places found in extremely waterless
country, where even the mounted hunter has much trouble to reach them. Like
elands and gemsbok and other desert-loving antelopes, they can exist for
long periods--months together--without drinking. In the northern portions
of the Kalahari Desert, where I have carefully observed their habits, as
well as hunted them, it is an undoubted fact that giraffes never touch
water during the whole of the dry winter season--for several months on end.
Gemsbok and elands in the same waterless tract of country are complete
abstainers for the same period. The flesh of a giraffe cow, if fairly
young, is excellent, tender, and well tasted, with a flavour of game-like
veal. The marrow-bones also, roasted over a gentle wood fire, and sawn in
half, afford delicious eating, quite one of the supreme delicacies of the
African wilderness.

THE OKAPI.

BY SIR HARRY JOHNSTON, K.C.B., F.Z.S.

Readers of "The Living Animals of the World" are in all probability readers
of newspapers, and it would therefore be affectation on the part of the
writer of these lines to assume that they have not heard more or less of
the discovery which he was privileged to make of an entirely new ruminant
of large size, dwelling in the forests bordering the Semliki River, in
Central Africa, on the borderland between the Uganda Protectorate and the
Congo Free State. The history of this discovery, stated briefly, is as
follows:--In 1882-83 I was the guest of Mr. (now Sir Henry) Stanley on the
River Congo at Stanley Pool. I was visiting the Congo at that time as an
explorer in a very small way and a naturalist. Mr. Stanley, conversing with
me on the possibility of African discoveries, told me then that he believed
that all that was most wonderful in tropical Africa would be found to be
concentrated in the region of the Blue Mountains, south of the Albert
Nyanza. This feeling on Stanley's part doubtless was one of the reasons
which urged him to go to the relief of Emin Pasha. His journey through the
great Congo Forest towards the Blue Mountains of the Albert Nyanza resulted
in his discovery of the greatest snow mountain-range of Africa, Ruwenzori,
and the river Semliki, which is the Upper Albertine Nile; of Lake Albert
Edward, from which it flows round the flanks of Ruwenzori; and, amongst
other things, in more detailed information regarding the dwarf races of the
Northern Congo forests than we had yet received. Stanley also was the first
to draw the attention of the world to the dense and awful character of
these mighty woods, and to hint at the mysteries and wonders in natural
history which they possibly contained. The stress and trouble of his
expedition prevented him and his companions from bestowing much attention
on natural history; moreover, in these forests it is extremely difficult
for persons who are passing hurriedly through the tangle to come into
actual contact with the beasts that inhabit them. Sir Henry Stanley,
discussing this subject with me since my return from Uganda, tells me that
he believes that the okapi is only one amongst several strange new beasts
which will be eventually discovered in these remarkable forests. He
describes having seen a creature like a gigantic pig 6 feet in length, and
certain antelopes unlike any known type. In regard to the okapi, the only
hint of its existence which he obtained was the announcement that the
dwarfs knew of the existence of a creature in their forests which greatly
resembled an ass in appearance, and which they caught in pits. This tiny
sentence in an appendix to his book "In Darkest Africa" attracted my
attention some time before I went to Uganda. It seemed to me so
extraordinary that any creature like a horse should inhabit a dense forest,
that I determined, if ever fate should lead me in that direction, I would
make enquiries.

MALE AND FEMALE GIRAFFES.

Giraffes are said to be very affectionate animals.]

Soon after reaching the Uganda Protectorate at the end of 1899, I came in
contact with a large party of dwarfs who had been kidnapped by a too
enterprising German impresario, who had decided to show them at the Paris
Exhibition. As the Belgians objected to this procedure, I released the
dwarfs from their kidnapper, and retained them with me for some months in
Uganda, until I was able personally to escort them back to their homes in
the Congo Forest. I had other reasons connected with my Government business
for visiting the north-western part of the Congo Free State. As soon as I
could make the dwarfs understand me by means of an interpreter, I
questioned them regarding the existence of this horse-like creature in
their forests. They at once understood what I meant; and pointing to a
zebra-skin and a live mule, they informed me that the creature in question,
which was called OKAPI, was like a mule with zebra stripes on it. When I
reached Fort Mbeni, in the Congo Free State, on the west bank of the river
Semliki, I put questions to the Belgian officers stationed there. They all
knew the okapi, at any rate, when dead. As a living animal they had none of
them seen it, but their native soldiers were in the habit of hunting the
animal in the forest and killing it with spears, and then bringing in the
skin and the flesh for use in the fort. One of the officers declared there
was even then a freshly obtained skin lying about in the precincts of the
fort. On searching for this, however, it was discovered that the greater
part of it had been thrown away, only the gaudier portions having been cut
into strips by the soldiers to be made into bandoliers. These strips,
together with similar ones obtained from natives in the forest, I sent to
England, to Dr. P. L. Sclater, for his consideration. Furnished by the
Belgian officers with guides, and taking with me all the dwarfs whom I had
brought from Uganda, I entered the forest, and remained there for some days
searching for the okapi. All this time I was convinced that I was on the
track of a species of horse; and therefore when the natives showed the
tracks of a cloven-footed animal like the eland, and told us these were the
foot-prints of the okapi, I disbelieved them, and imagined that we were
merely following a forest-eland. We never saw the okapi; and as the life in
the forest made the whole expedition extremely ill, and my time was
required for official work elsewhere, I was obliged to give up this search.
Meantime, I had elicited from the natives, whom I questioned closely, that
the okapi was a creature without horns or any means of offence, the size of
a large antelope or mule, which inhabited only the densest parts of the
forest, and generally went about in pairs, male and female. It lived
chiefly on leaves. The Belgian officers, seeing that I was disappointed at
not obtaining a complete skin, offered to use their best efforts to obtain
one for me, and send it on to Uganda after my departure.

THE OKAPI OF THE CONGO FOREST.

Previous to the discovery of this ruminant the giraffe stood alone among
the mammals of the world. It has now at least one living relative.]

This promise was eventually redeemed by Mr. Karl Eriksson, a Swedish
officer in the Belgian service. Mr. Eriksson sent me a complete skin and
two skulls. The skin and the bigger of the two skulls belonged to a young
male. This is the skin which is now set up in the Natural History Museum at
South Kensington, and of which a photographic illustration accompanies this
notice. Upon receiving this skin, I saw at once what the okapi was--namely,
a close relation of the giraffe. From the very small development of the
horn-bosses, I believed that it was nearer allied to the helladotherium
than to the living giraffe. In forwarding the specimens to Professor Ray
Lankester, I therefore proposed that it should be called _Helladotherium
tigrinum_. Professor Ray Lankester, having examined the specimens with a
greater knowledge than I possessed, decided that the animal was rather more
closely allied to the giraffe than to the helladotherium, but that it
possessed sufficient peculiarities of its own to oblige him to create for
its reception a new genus, which he proposed to call _Ocapia_.

[Illustration: _Copyright photograph by Hutchinson & Co._

HEAD OF OKAPI.

The enormous size of the ears is very noteworthy.]

Meantime, the original strips of the skin (which apparently belonged to an
older and larger animal than the specimen mounted at South Kensington) had
been pronounced by experts to whom they were submitted to be the skin of an
undiscovered species of horse, and this supposed new horse had been
tentatively named by Dr. P. L. Sclater _Equus johnstoni_. The full
discovery obliged Professor Ray Lankester to set aside any idea of the
okapi being allied to the horse, but he was good enough to attach Mr.
Sclater's specific name of _johnstoni_ to his newly founded genus of
_Ocapia_.

Up to the time of writing this is all that is known of this extraordinary
survival in the Congo Forest of the only living relation of the giraffe. We
know by palæontological discoveries in Europe and in Asia that there
existed a large family of ruminants which in their development and features
were neither of the Ox group nor of the Deer, but in some respects occupied
a position midway between these two branches of cloven-hoofed, horned,
ruminating Ungulates. To this family the Giraffe, the Okapi, the
Helladotherium, the Samotherium, the Sivatherium, and the Bramatherium
belong. In all probability bony projections arose from the skulls of these
creatures similar in some measure to the prominent bony cores of the horns
of oxen. From the top, however, of these bony cores there would seem to
have arisen anciently antlers, possibly deciduous like those of the
prongbuck. In time creatures like the giraffe lost any need for such
weapons of offence, and ceased to grow antlers; but the bony cores from
which these antlers once proceeded still remained, and in the case of the
giraffe remain to the present day. In the helladotherium and in the okapi
these bony cores have dwindled to mere bumps.

CHAPTER XVII.

_THE DEER TRIBE._

BY H. A. BRYDEN.

Deer represent as a family the non-domesticated class of ruminants.
Generally speaking, the males are distinguished by antlers, which are shed
periodically, usually once a year, and again renewed. Comprising as it does
some of the noblest mammals to be found on the face of the earth, this
large and important tribe is to be found distributed over a large portion
of the world's surface, from the Arctic North, the home of the wild
reindeer, to Patagonia, in Southern South America. Deer are, however, not
found in the continent of Africa south of the Sahara, nor in Madagascar or
Australia. They are not indigenous to New Zealand; but the red deer,
introduced there some years ago for purposes of sport, have thriven
wonderfully well, and are now completely acclimatised.

From the earliest times deer, especially those species known as the true or
typical deer, of which red deer may be said to be a type, have been animals
of considerable importance to mankind. Their flesh has been always eagerly
sought after; deer-skin is still, even in these days of high civilisation,
useful for many purposes; and the antlers are almost equally in request.

It is more than probable that, in the vast and still little-explored
regions of Central, East, and Northern Asia, new species of deer remain to
be discovered. At the present time there are known to exist, in various
parts of the world, close on a hundred species and varieties.

Within the space allotted to these animals it is, of course, manifestly
impossible to notice all these in anything like detail. Many of the
varieties or sub-species closely resemble one another, so much so that the
differences between them are only apparent to the eyes of naturalists or
acute observers.


THE REINDEER.

[Illustration: _Photo by Valentine & Sons, Ltd._]     [_Dundee._

SCANDINAVIAN REINDEER.

The spreading hoofs enable the reindeer to traverse snow and swamps without
sinking.]

REINDEER are distinguished from all other kinds of deer by the fact that
antlers are borne by both males and females. The antlers, as may be seen by
the illustration, differ materially from those of the red deer, elk, and
other species; the brow-tines, especially, are often much palmated. These
animals are heavily built, short-legged, and, as beseems dwellers in a
snowy habitat, provided with round, short, and spreading hoofs. For ages
reindeer have been domesticated by the Lapps of Scandinavia, the Samoyeds,
and other primitive races of Northern Europe and Asia. Trained to harness,
and drawing a sledge, they traverse long distances, while their milk,
flesh, and hides are of great importance to the people who keep them. The
Common or SCANDINAVIAN REINDEER ranges from Norway through Northern Europe
into Asia, though how far eastward is not yet accurately determined. It is
interesting to note that these animals were once denizens of Britain, and
so lately as the twelfth century the Jarls of Orkney are believed to have
been in the habit of crossing to the mainland for the purpose of hunting
them in the wilds of Caithness. Wild reindeer are still to be found in the
remoter parts of Norway, though, from much persecution, they are becoming
comparatively scarce in most parts of the country.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

WOODLAND CARIBOU.

This specimen has shed its horns, which are of the general type of those of
the Scandinavian race.]

Mr. Abel Chapman, in his "Wild Norway," gives some excellent accounts of
sport with these fine deer. Speaking of a good herd of twenty-one,
discovered in Ryfylke, he says: "Most of the deer were lying down, but both
the big stags stood upright in dreamy, inert postures.... I now fully
realised what a truly magnificent animal I had before me. Both in body and
horn he was a giant, and his coat was no less remarkable; the neck was pure
white, and beneath it a shaggy mane hung down a foot in length. This white
neck was set off by the dark head in front and the rich glossy brown of his
robe behind. Besides this the contrasting black and white bars on flanks
and stern were conspicuously clean-cut and defined, and the long and
massive antlers showed a splendid recurved sweep, surmounted by branch-like
tines, all clean." For three long, agonising hours the stalker watched this
noble prize, and then one of those lucky chances which occasionally gladden
the hunter's heart occurred, and the reindeer approached within a hundred
yards. "Half-a-dozen forward steps, and his white neck and dark shoulder
were beautifully exposed. Already, ere his head had appeared, the rifle had
been shifted over, and now the foresight dwelt lovingly on a thrice-refined
aim. The .450 bullet struck to an inch, just where the shaggy mane joined
the brown shoulder. The beast winced all over, but neither moved nor fell.
A moment's survey, and I knew by the swaying of his head that he was mine."
The weight of this big reindeer stag was estimated at 450 lbs., or 32
stone. He carried twenty-five points to his antlers, which measured 51
inches in extreme length.

IMMATURE SCANDINAVIAN ELK.

The largest of all the Deer Tribe, and has antlers of an altogether
abnormal type.]

In addition to the common or Scandinavian reindeer, there are closely
allied races, showing, however, slightly varying characteristics, found in
Spitzbergen and Greenland. In North America, where only wild reindeer are
found, these animals are known as CARIBOU. Here several sub-species are
known: among them, the NEWFOUNDLAND CARIBOU; the WOODLAND CARIBOU of the
mainland; and the BARREN-GROUND CARIBOU, found in the arctic wastes of the
Far North-west, towards the Polar Ocean.


THE ELK, OR MOOSE.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

FEMALE AMERICAN ELK, OR MOOSE.

The elk of the two hemispheres are so alike that they cannot be regarded as
anything more than races of a single species.]

This gigantic creature, the largest of all the numerous tribe of deer, is
found, in the Old World, in Northern Europe, Siberia, and Northern China.
Its range extends--for there is no real distinction between the elk of the
Old and the New Worlds--to Northern America, where it is always known as
the MOOSE. Its transatlantic habitat runs from the mouth of the Mackenzie
River to the St. Lawrence. Wherever its abiding-place may be, it will be
found that the elk is essentially a forest-loving creature, partial to the
loneliest stretches of the woods and dreary marshes. Its fleshy, bulbous,
prehensile muzzle shows plainly that the elk is a browsing beast, and not a
grazing animal, like most other deer. The male carries vast palmated horns,
measuring sometimes as much as 6 feet 1¼ inch in span from tip to tip; this
measurement is from an American specimen in the possession of the Duke of
Westminster. A fine Scandinavian bull will measure 18 hands at the withers
and weigh as much as 90 stone, while the North American elk is said to
attain as much as 1,400 lbs. In colour the elk is a dark brownish grey; the
neck, body, and tail are short; while the animal stands very high upon the
legs. Under the throat of the male hangs a singular appendage, a sort of
tassel of hair and skin, known to American hunters as the "bell." The build
of the elk is clumsy, and the mighty beast entirely lacks the grace
characteristic of so many others of the deer kind. It has in truth a
strangely primeval, old-world aspect, and seems rather to belong to
prehistoric ages than to modern times.

In Scandinavia elk are hunted usually in two ways--by driving, or with a
trained dog held in leash. In the royal forests of Sweden great bags are
made at these drives; and in the year 1885, when a great hunt was got up
for the present King of England, forty-nine elk were slain. Except during
the rutting-season these titanic deer are extremely shy and suspicious
creatures, and the greatest precautions have to be taken in hunting them.

In Canada moose are often shot during the rutting-season by "calling," a
rude horn of birch-bark being used, with which the hunter simulates the
weird, hoarse roar of the animals, as they call to one another, or
challenge in the primeval woodlands and morasses of the wild North.
Still-hunting or tracking--spooring, as it would be called in South
Africa--is another and extremely fatiguing method; while yet another mode
of hunting is that practised by Indian and half-breed hunters in winter,
when, the sportsman being mounted on snow-shoes, the moose is followed, run
into and shot in deep snow. In this sport the hunter has much the better of
it. The moose, with its vast weight and sharp hoofs, plunges through the
frozen snow-crust, over which the snow-shoes carry the biped easily enough,
and, becoming presently exhausted, is shot without much difficulty. Elk
usually run at a steady, slinging trot, and traverse extraordinary
distances, apparently with little fatigue.


RED DEER.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

PARK RED DEER.

The typical representative of the entire Deer Tribe.]

We come now to a group of what are called typical deer, the RED DEER, found
in various parts of the world. The red deer, which once roamed over much of
Britain, is now in the wild state confined chiefly to the Highlands of
Scotland, Exmoor, part of County Kerry in Ireland, and various islands on
the west coast of Scotland. A good male specimen will stand about 4 feet or
a little less at the shoulder, carry antlers bearing twelve or fourteen
points, and weigh from 10 to 20 stone clean--that is, with the heart,
liver, and lungs taken out. The woodland stags of Perthshire, however, not
infrequently reach 25 stone, while Mr. J. G. Millais mentions a stag,
killed by Colonel the Hon. Alastair Fraser at Beaufort, Inverness-shire,
which scaled 30 stone 2 lbs. clean. This seems to be the heaviest British
wild stag of modern times. The summer coat is short, shining, and reddish
brown in hue; in winter the pelage is thicker and rougher and greyish brown
in colour. Stalking the red deer stag in its native fastnesses is beyond
all doubt the finest wild sport now left to the inhabitants of these
islands.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

AN ASIATIC WAPITI.

All the races of the wapiti are easily recognisable by the large fourth
tine of the antlers and the short tail.]

Mr. J. G. Millais, author of "British Deer and their Horns" and other
works, himself a first-rate sportsman in many parts of the world, compares
the style of shooting red deer in vogue forty or fifty years ago with that
obtaining in the Highlands at the present day. "A stalker in Black Mount,
Argyllshire," he says, "told me of a typical day's sport in which he took
part some forty years ago. Fox Maule and Sir Edwin Landseer were the two
rifles (they frequently stalked in pairs at that time), and, on the side of
Clashven, Peter Robertson, the head forester, brought them within eighty
yards of two exceptionally fine stags. Maule fired and missed, as did also
Sir Edwin as the stags moved away; then, on a signal from Robertson. Peter
McColl, the gillie, slipped the hounds--the two best ever owned by the late
Marquis of Breadalbane, and whose portraits are still preserved in the
famous picture of 'The Deer Drive'--and away they went in hot pursuit of
the deer. An end-on chase now ensued, the line taken being due east down
the great glen towards Loch Dochart, and at last the stalkers were brought
to a standstill, being fairly exhausted both in wind and limb. At this
moment, however, four dark spots, like small rocks, standing out at the
point of a little promontory in the lake, attracted their attention, and,
on drawing nearer, they saw, to their surprise, each of the big stags being
held at bay by a gallant hound. A couple of shots then settled the
business, and so ended what was then considered a grand day's sport. No
doubt it was most exciting to see the struggle of bone and sinew between
two such noble quadrupeds, but it was not rifle-shooting. To-day the
gallant but disturbing deer-hound has given place to the cunning and
obedient collie, and the success of the stalker depends, for the most part,
on the accuracy of his rifle and his skill in using it."

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

AMERICAN WAPITI.

The giant deer of the Rocky Mountains, formerly very plentiful, now
scarce.]

Here are a couple of sketches of modern stalking taken from Mr. Millais'
own diary:--

"_Wednesday, October 4th._--Started for the big corrie with McColl, and saw
nothing till we got to the Eagle Hill. On this were three stags and about
twenty hinds, the property of a magnificent fellow carrying one of the best
heads I have ever seen on Black Mount. For some time McColl thought he was
just a bit too good to shoot, for the very best in this forest are
generally left for stock purposes. Finding, however, that, he was not Royal
[a twelve-pointer], my companion agreed to a shot--that is, if he got
within shooting distance, which was not too likely, the Eagle Hill being
one of those queer places where back eddies are carried down from almost
every 'airt' from which the wind is blowing. Luck is apparently entirely my
way this week, so far at any rate. The big stag was very 'kittle,'
frequently roaring and keeping his hinds moving before him along the
hillside, in the direction of another corrie running at right angles, the
entrance to which, if reached, would checkmate us. A quick, stiff climb,
and a clashing piece of stalking on the part of McColl, brought us in front
of the herd only just in time, for I had hardly got into position when the
first few hinds moved past a hundred yards below us. They were very uneasy
and highly suspicious, but fortunately did not stop; and in another moment,
to my joy, the big stag came slowly behind them, and offered a fair
broadside in the very spot where I should have wished him to stand. The
bullet took him through the ribs, certainly a trifle too far back, but he
gave in at once, and rolled 150 yards down the hill, fortunately without
hurting his horns. A really fine Highland stag in his prime; weight, 16
stone 2 lbs., with a good wild head of ten points, and good cups on the
top."

"_Thursday, October 5th._--We negotiated the stiff climb, and McLeish,
leaving me behind a rock on the summit, returned some distance to signal
directions to the pony-man. He came back just as the stag returned roaring
down the pass he had ascended; and as the mist was blotting out the
landscape, I feared he would come right on to us without being seen, but,
as luck would have it, he stopped and recommenced bellowing within seventy
yards. I never heard a stag make such a row, but nothing of him could we
see. It was most exciting, lying flat on a slab of rock, hoping devoutly
that the mist would rise, if only for a few seconds. The tension had grown
extreme, when there was a momentary lift in the gloom, and I made out the
dim forms of the deer just as a big hind, which I had not noticed,
'bruached' loudly within twenty yards of us. The outline of the stag was
barely visible when, after carefully aiming, I pressed the trigger, knowing
that a moment later there would be no second chance. At the shot the deer
at once disappeared, but I felt sure I had hit him, and, on following the
tracks for some fifty yards, there he lay as dead as a door-nail. Weight,
13 stone 6 lbs.; a wild head of ten points; thin, and evidently that of a
deer on the decline."

[Illustration: _Photo by Mr. W. Rau_]     [_Philadelphia._

AMERICAN WAPITI.

The dark head, fore-quarters, and under-parts, so distinctive of the
wapiti, are here well displayed.]

In England the wild red deer are hunted with stag-hounds on Exmoor, and
first-rate sport is obtained on the great moorlands of Somerset and Devon.
During the last fifty years the deer have much increased in numbers, and no
less than three packs--the Devon and Somerset, Sir John Heathcoat-Amory's,
and Mr. Peter Ormrod's--are now engaged in hunting them. In the five years
ending in 1892, 276 deer were killed by the Devon and Somerset hounds.

The young of the red deer are in Europe usually dropped in June. The fawn
is dexterously concealed by the hind amid the heather, and is left in
concealment during the day. Scrope, a great authority on these animals,
states that the hind induces her fawn to lie down by pressure of the nose:
"It will never stir or lift up its head the whole of the day, unless you
come right upon it, as I have often done; it lies like a dog, with its nose
to its tail. The hind, however, although she often separates herself from
the young fawn, does not lose sight of its welfare, but remains at a
distance to windward, and goes to its succour in case of an attack of the
wild cat or fox, or any other powerful vermin."

On the Continent far finer examples of red deer are to be found than in the
British Isles, and the antlers and records of weights preserved at the
Castle of Moritzburg in Saxony, and elsewhere, show that two hundred years
ago the stags of Germany were far superior even to those of the present
day, which are much heavier and afford finer trophies than do the Highland
red deer. Even in Germany, however, marked deterioration has taken place
during the last two centuries. A stag, for example, killed by the Elector
of Saxony in 1646 weighed not less than 61 stone 11 lbs.; while from the
Elector's records between 1611 and 1656 it appears that 59 stags exceeded
56 stone, 651 exceeded 48 stone, 2,679 exceeded 40 stone, and 4,139
exceeded 32 stone. These figures are given by Mr. W. A. Baillie-Grohman, a
distinguished sportsman, in a very interesting chapter contributed to the
"Big Game Shooting" volumes of the Badminton Library.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

AMERICAN WAPITI.

In the United States this species is universally miscalled the Elk.]

This deterioration among the red deer of the forests of Central and
Northern Europe is, however, not traceable among the red deer of the wild
mountainous regions of Austria-Hungary and South-eastern Europe. Here, at
the present day, stags of enormous size and weight are still to be found.
In the Carpathian Alps, for example, red deer stags are still to be shot
scaling more than 40 stone (clean) in weight. Climate and feeding have, of
course, much to do with the weight of stags and the size and beauty of
their antlers. The Carpathian stags have enormous range, rich food, and, as
Mr. Baillie-Grohman points out, are suffered during the summer to "make
undisturbed raids upon the rich agricultural valleys ... the feudal sway
exercised by the great territorial magnates permitting the deer to trespass
upon the crops with impunity, and thus grow to be the lustiest of their
race."

In addition to the British Islands, the red deer of Europe is found on the
island of Hitteren on the western coast of Norway, in the south of Sweden,
and in Germany, Russia, France, Spain, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Greece.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

ALTAI WAPITI.

This is one of several Asiatic forms of the wapiti.]

In Corsica and Sardinia a local and smaller race is found, probably closely
allied to the stag of North Africa. The BARBARY STAG is somewhat smaller
than its first cousin of Europe, and carries antlers which usually lack the
second, or bez, tine. The colour of this stag is "a dark sepia-brown, a
little lighter and greyer on the back. Faint yellowish spots can
occasionally be distinguished on the fur in the adults," says Sir Harry
Johnston. The hinds are of the same colour as the stags, but lack the grey
tint on the back. These fine deer are found in Algeria and Tunis, their
habitat being chiefly in pine and cork forests. They are found also in
parts of Morocco, near the frontiers of Algeria and Tunis, where their
range extends from near the Mediterranean to the verge of the Sahara
Desert. Formerly the Barbary stag was hunted by the Arabs on horseback by
the aid of greyhounds. In Tunis, where it is protected by the French, it is
now fairly abundant.


THE MARAL AND KASHMIR STAG.

The CASPIAN RED DEER, or MARAL, is a magnificent sub-species, incomparably
the finest representative of the red deer species. Standing about 4 feet 6
inches at the shoulder, a good stag will weigh as much as 40 stone clean,
in exceptional specimens probably a good deal more. The range of this noble
beast includes the Caspian provinces of North Persia, Transcaucasia, the
Caucasus, and the Crimea. There can be little doubt that the great stags
shot in the Galician Carpathians are Caspian red deer, and not the ordinary
red deer of Western Europe. The red deer of Turkey is, too, no doubt
referable to this sub-species.

Continuing our survey of typical deer, we come to the KASHMIR STAG, which
is a magnificent beast, standing as much as 4 feet 4 inches at the
shoulder, and carrying antlers approaching the red deer type, which measure
in fine specimens from 45 to 48 inches. The Kashmir stag, often miscalled
Barasingh by Indian sportsmen, makes its home in the forest regions of the
north side of the Kashmir Valley, ranging chiefly on altitudes of from
5,000 to 12,000 feet. The summer coat is rufous; in winter the pelage is of
a darkish brown. The Yarkand stag is an apparently allied species, found in
the forests bordering on the Yarkand or Tarim River.

Two more stags close the list of those Asiatic deer which approximate more
or less closely to the red deer type. These are the SHOU, or SIKHIM STAG,
and THOROLD'S DEER, concerning neither of which animals is much known at
present. The shou, of which only the head has yet been brought to England,
appears to be a very large stag, in size approximating to the gigantic
wapiti. The antlers are very large, extending to as much as 55 inches over
the outer curve. So far as is at present known, this great deer is found in
the country "north of Bhutan and the valley eastward of Chumbi, which
drains northward into the Sangpo." No European hunter, it is believed, has
ever yet levelled a rifle or even set eyes on this noble deer.

In England Thorold's deer is known from two specimens shot by Dr. W. G.
Thorold, during a journey across Tibet, at an elevation of about 13,500
feet. The high Tibetan plateau and other adjacent parts of Central Asia
form the habitat of this species. In size Thorold's deer is about on a
level with the Kashmir stag: the coat is dark brown; the antlers are
distinctive in their backward curve, in the lack of the bez tine, and their
flattened appearance. The muzzle and chin are pure white, as is the inner
surface of the ears.


WAPITI.

Wapiti are the giants of the red deer group, carrying enormous antlers, and
attaining as much as 1,000 lbs. in weight. The true wapiti of North
America, known in that country chiefly by the local name of Elk, carry by
far the finest and the heaviest heads of any of the typical deer kind. Mr.
Rowland Ward, in his book "Records of Big Game," gives the length of
antlers of a twelve-pointer shot in the Olympic Mountains, Washington
State, as 70 inches over the outer curve; while another specimen, also a
twelve-pointer, taken from a wapiti shot in Wyoming, measures 66 inches.
Occasional heads bear as many as 17, 19, and even 20 tines, or points, but
from 12 to 14 points are more usual in fine average heads. A good stag will
stand from 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches at the shoulder.
Magnificently shaped, splendid in form and bearing, as in the size of its
antlers, a more lordly creature than the stag wapiti does not pace the
earth.

MANCHURIAN WAPITI CALLING.

The great size of the fourth tine, characteristic of the species, is very
noticeable.]

"The wapiti," says Colonel Theodore Roosevelt in "The Encyclopedia of
Sport," "is highly polygamous, and during the rut the master bulls gather
great harems about them and do fierce battle with one another, while the
weaker bulls are driven off by themselves. At this time the bulls are
comparatively easy to approach, because they are very noisy, incessantly
challenging one another by night and day. Settlers and hunters usually
speak of their challenge as 'whistling,' but this is a very inadequate
description. The challenge consists of several notes, first rising and then
falling. Heard near by, especially among unattractive surroundings, it is
not particularly impressive, varying in tone from a squeal to a roar, and
ending with grunts; but at a little distance it is one of the most musical
sounds in nature, sounding like some beautiful wind instrument. Nothing
makes the heart of a hunter leap and thrill like the challenge of a wapiti
bull, as it comes pealing down under the great archways of the mountain
pines, through the still, frosty, fall weather; all the more if it be at
night, under the full moon, and if there is light snow on the ground."

Wapiti in North America have suffered much from persecution, and it is now
difficult indeed to secure fine heads like those that fell to hunters
twenty or thirty years since. Twelve or fifteen years ago, during
winter-time, bands of wapiti in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana were to be
seen gathered together to the number of thousands; now a score or two is
the rule, where these animals are to be found at all. However, by those who
know where to go for their game, and can hold a rifle straight, wapiti are
still to be obtained.

Mr. Selous, in his "Sport and Travel, East and West," thus describes a
recent experience: "After a few seconds of agonising suspense a
noble-looking monarch of the mountains walked slowly from the shelter of
the pine-trees and followed the ladies of his household, who had now halted
about fifty yards down the slope, passing in quite open ground not more
than sixty or seventy yards below me; and as the stag followed them, I
waited until he came past, though he had been well within shot ever since
he came out from among the trees. As he did not know where I was, and
probably had not the least idea why the hinds had trotted off, he came
along very leisurely, looking magnificent; for although his antlers were
but moderate in size, there were no others of larger proportions near to
dwarf them, and even a very ordinary wapiti stag, seen at short range in
its native wilds, is a glorious sight to look upon. I let him get a little
past me, and then put one of Holland's peg-bullets just behind his
shoulder, low down. I saw by the convulsive rush forwards that he made that
he was struck through the heart, but I did not expect so large an animal to
collapse so quickly. He had not gone twenty paces after being hit, when he
fell suddenly right on to the prostrate stem of a large tree, which did
not, however, stop him, as the impetus of his fall carried him over it, and
he then went sliding at a terrific pace down the steep snow-slope below,
and disappeared from sight almost immediately." The dead wapiti was
ultimately found 500 feet below, with the antlers, strangely enough,
scarcely injured, but the body and quarters much bruised by the fall. He
was "a very pretty fourteen-pointer of moderate size."

AN AXIS HIND.

A species spotted at all seasons.]

A fight between two wapiti stags is a terrific encounter. "With heads
lowered between their fore feet," says Mr. Perry, "the two adversaries walk
around, waiting for an opening; and when one is thrown off his guard, the
other makes a savage rush; but his opponent instantly recovers, counters
the charge, and as they rush together the antlers strike each other with
such terrific force that the report can be heard for a long distance.
Slowly retreating, bellowing, grumbling, and grinding their teeth in a
paroxysm of rage, they again circle round.... The challenging wapiti
usually does most of the offensive fighting until he finds (if such be the
case) that he is the weaker; then he suddenly retires, bellowing as he
goes." In the old days the Indians of North America were in the habit of
organising great wapiti drives. Entire herds were surrounded by a ring of
mounted men, and forced over precipices.

One of the numerous Philippine species.]

In recent years it has been discovered that wapiti are also denizens of
certain parts of Asia. At least two sub-species--the ALTAI WAPITI and the
MANCHURIAN WAPITI--have thus far been identified. The former, sometimes
known as the Thian-shan Stag, is found in the forests of the Altai and
Thian-shan Mountains, west of the Mongolian Desert. Compared with its
American congener, it is inferior in stature, has shorter legs, a longer
body, and proportionately larger antlers, though none have yet approached
those of the longest American specimens. These splendid stags, of which
living specimens have been maintained by the Duke of Bedford at Woburn, are
captured alive by the Altai natives, and kept in domestication for the sake
of their antlers, which are sold in China for purposes of medicine at as
much as the value of £10 apiece.

The MANCHURIAN WAPITI, or LUEHDORF'S STAG, is a well-marked local race of
the wapiti, which turns reddish in summer. It has received several names,
and is well characterised by the form of its antlers. It has been kept
alive in the Duke of Bedford's park at Woburn Abbey. It seems probable that
the Siberian stags will eventually be referred to the wapiti group.


BOKHARA DEER.

A fine deer from Russian Turkestan is at present known as the BOKHARA DEER.
It is said to resemble the shou of Northern Bhutan more than any other
species, and, standing about 4 feet at the shoulder, is of an ashen-grey
colour, tinged with yellow. A living specimen has been exhibited at Moscow,
and it is believed that specimens in the collection of the Duke of Bedford
belong to this form.


SIKAS.

The SIKAS, as typified by the JAPANESE DEER, are a group of deer of
moderate size, distinguished from the preceding assemblage by antlers of
simpler type, each antler having usually four points, and lacking the
second, or bez tine. The coat is spotted with white, and white markings
appear about the tail. The tail is much longer than in the red deer group.
The Japanese deer, found in Japan and North China, is a beautiful creature,
somewhat smaller than the fallow deer of Europe, having a coat of brilliant
chestnut, thickly spotted with white in curious longitudinal markings. This
is the summer pelage; in winter the colour changes to dark brown, and the
spots mostly disappear. When in the velvet, the antlers are of a bright,
chestnut-red, with black tips, and at this season the bucks look their
handsomest. A good head measures from 26 to 31 inches, and carries usually
eight points.

The MANCHURIAN SIKA may be looked upon as a larger variety of the Japanese
deer, with a somewhat darker coat.

Another closely allied form is the FORMOSAN SIKA, which bears a rather
paler summer coat, and carries spots in its winter pelage. This deer is
found on the mountains of the island from which it takes its name. The few
antlers which have reached this country seem to indicate that in this
respect this deer is inferior to the other sikas. The longest pair yet
recorded measure not more than 19¾ inches.

The PEKIN SIKA, sometimes known as Dybowski's Deer, is considerably larger
in size than the rest of the group, standing well over 3 feet at the
shoulder. The horns are large and rugged, and measure as much as 27 inches
in length. The coat is thick and shaggy, and well adapted for life in a
harsh climate. The habitat of this species is North-eastern Manchuria and
the borders of Korea.


FALLOW DEER.

FALLOW DEER are, perhaps, to English people, the most familiar of all the
cervine race, forming as they do, in the semi-domesticated state, the
adornments of most of our parks. The flesh of this handsome deer furnishes
the well-known venison of this country, and is perhaps the best-tasted of
all deer-meat. A good fallow buck stands about 3 feet at the shoulder, and
weighs (clean) about 150 lbs., though specimens have been shot weighing as
much as 204 lbs., but this is exceptional. The horns are strongly palmated.
Originally this deer was not indigenous to Britain, but is often said to
have been introduced by the Romans from Eastern Europe.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

A YOUNG FALLOW BUCK OF THE BROWN BREED.

The favourite park-deer of England.]

The COMMON FALLOW DEER is found in the wild state in Spain, Portugal,
Greece, Austria, Rhodes, Sardinia, Asia Minor, and North Palestine. It is
doubtful whether, as has been stated, this deer ever existed in modern
times in the wild state in North Africa. This is a highly gregarious
species, delighting to move in considerable herds. In some parts of
Scotland fallow deer have reverted completely to the wild state, and afford
excellent sport. And even park-deer, once they are shot at, exhibit
extraordinary wariness and cunning, so much so that curious tricks and
disguises have often to be resorted to when a fat buck has to be shot for
venison.

The beautiful MESOPOTAMIAN FALLOW DEER, found in the mountains of Luristan,
in Mesopotamian Persia, is somewhat larger than the common species, while
its coat is much more brightly coloured. The antlers bear little
resemblance to those seen in the park-deer of this country, being far less
palmated and spreading, and more vertical.

The enormous horns of the extinct deer once known as IRISH ELK are now
considered by naturalists to be those of a gigantic species of fallow deer.
By the kindness of Mr. J. G. Millais, I am enabled to give the dimensions
of a pair of antlers of one of these wonderful beasts from his museum.
These antlers measure in spread, from tip to tip, 9 feet 4 inches; length
round inside of right horn, 6 feet; round left horn, 5 feet 8 inches,--a
marvellous trophy, truly. This specimen was dug up in County Waterford.
These colossal fallow deer, which roamed the wastes of Ireland in
prehistoric times, must have afforded fairly exciting sport to the feebly
armed human beings who then existed.


THE SAMBAR, OR RUSINE DEER.

[Illustration: _Photo by Miss E. J. Beck._

A SAMBAR STAG.

The only Indian deer of which the fawns are unspotted.]

SAMBAR may be shortly described as large deer, having rough, shaggy coats,
and big, rugged antlers of simple type, usually displaying but three tines.
They belong to the group known as Typical Deer, although they are but
distantly connected with the red deer. The colour of the coat is usually
dark umber-brown, marked with chestnut about the rump and under-parts. The
well-known sambar of India stands as much as 5 feet 4 inches at the
withers, and weighs, before being cleaned, some 600 lbs. The longest pair
of antlers yet recorded (Rowland Ward's "Records of Big Game") measure 48
inches in length over the outer curve. Usually to be found among jungly,
wooded hills and mountains in many parts of India and Ceylon, this fine
stag affords first-rate sport, and is much sought after by shikaris. It is
to be met with in small troops of from four to a dozen, or singly, while
during the rutting-season the animals rove in more considerable herds. In
jungle and thickly forested regions it is a hard matter to come up with the
sambar on foot, and it is there usually shot from elephant-back, by the aid
of beaters. In more open hill country it affords good stalking. In Ceylon
it is hunted with hounds, and yields in this way also capital sport. These
animals seem to revel in heat, and love to shelter themselves in hot,
stifling valleys; they drink only once in two or three days. It is a
noticeable feature in connection with the antlers of the sambar that they
are not invariably shed annually, as with most of the deer kind. In Ceylon,
according to Sir Samuel Baker, they are shed "with great irregularity every
third or fourth year."

FORMOSAN SIKA STAG.

Like its Japanese kindred, this deer is spotted only in summer.]

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

JAVAN RUSA STAG.

This deer is a near relative of sambur, but has a somewhat different type
of antler.]

Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Heber Percy thus writes concerning the sambar,
or sambur: "Compared with the Kashmir stag, red deer, or wapiti, he looks
an ugly, coarse, underbred brute.... As the sambur is almost entirely
nocturnal in its habits, it is most commonly shot in drives, and in many
places it is almost impossible to obtain sambur otherwise; but where it can
be managed, stalking is, of course, far better fun. The sportsman should be
on his ground just before daylight, and work slowly through the forest at
the edge of the feeding-grounds, taking the bottom of the hill if there are
crops on the plain below, or, failing these, the edges of the open glades
in the forest. Presently, if there are any sambur about, he will hear their
trumpet-like call, and, creeping on, see two or three dark forms moving
among the trees. In the grey of the morning it is often very hard to
distinguish a stag from a hind, and the writer has on several occasions had
to wait, after viewing the herd, till there was light enough to pick his
stag. Even in broad daylight it is difficult to judge the size of a stag's
horns as he stands motionless in the deep gloom of the forest, and what
little can be seen of them makes them look three times their real size--the
beam is so massive and the tines so long. The stag, too, is such a big
beast, standing nearly a hand taller than a barasingh, that if seen in the
open he looks as big as our Irish elk.... All driving should be done during
the heat of the day, when the animals are lying down; trying to drive when
beasts are naturally on the move generally results in the game leaving the
beat before the men are in their places. It may sound ridiculous for a man
to get up a tree in a sambur drive, but he is far more likely to get an
easy shot in this position, as the deer will neither see nor wind him; he
commands more ground, and he runs no risk of heading back the wary old hind
which often leads the herd, the chances being that if he is rightly posted
the herd will come right under his tree. Another advantage is that, his
fire being plunging, he can shoot all round without danger to the beaters.
In some parts of the Himalaya native shikaris declare that they often shoot
sambur by selecting a likely path and improvising a salt-lick, after the
fashion of Laplanders when they want to catch their tame reindeer." The
flesh of this deer is coarse and only moderately good eating.

HOG-DEER.

The smallest Indian representative of the sambar group.]

The MALAYAN SAMBAR, found from Assam, through Burma, to the Malay
Peninsula, and in Siam, Hainan, Borneo, and perhaps Sumatra, is slightly
less in size than its Indian prototype; the antlers vary somewhat, and are
shorter and stouter. The longest antlers yet recorded measure 30-7/8 inches
over the outer curve; these come from Borneo.

The FORMOSAN SAMBAR, sometimes called Swinhoe's Deer, is, again, closely
connected with the Malayan sambar, and may be looked upon as purely a local
race. The antlers appear to run smaller, the best recorded examples only
extending to 19¾ inches.

The LUZON SAMBAR (Philippines), a small sub-species, and the SZECHUAN
SAMBAR (North-west China), are also local races of the same species. This
last seems thus far to occupy the most northerly habitat of this group.

The BASILAN SAMBAR (Philippines) is, like its congener of Luzon, a small
sub-species, standing no more than from 24 to 26 inches at the shoulder, of
slender build, and with the hindquarters higher than the withers. The best
antlers yet recorded measure no more than 15½ inches. It is interesting to
note that as the island of Basilan is the smallest of the Philippines, so
is this sambar by far the smallest of its group. Its restricted habitat has
no doubt conduced, during long ages, to bring about this result.

The JAVAN SAMBAR, or RUSA, is a distinct species, found, as its name
implies, in the island of Java. The antlers are somewhat slender, but are,
next to those of the sambar of India, the longest of the group. The best
recorded pair measure 35½ inches, while another pair from Mauritius, where
this animal has been introduced, measure half an inch longer. This sambar
is smaller than the great sambar of India, and is about on a par with a
good red deer.

[Illustration: _Photo by The Duchess of Bedford, Woburn Abbey._

FALLOW DEER.

There are two breeds of these beautiful deer in the British Isles; in the
one the summer coat is fawn dappled with white; in the other the colour is
dark brown at all seasons.]

The MOLUCCAN RUSA, a sub-species somewhat smaller than the Javan deer, is
found in Celebes and certain islands--Boru, Batchian, and Amboina--in the
Moluccan group; while the TIMOR RUSA, a closely allied congener, is found
on the islands of Timor, Semao, and Kambing. It is possible--nay, even
probable--that the Malays may, in times gone by, have introduced certain of
these rusine deer from one habitat to another. Such, at least, seems to be
the presumption among naturalists.

Dr. Guillemard, in that charming book "The Cruise of the Marchesa" (p.
357), gives some interesting information concerning Moluccan sambar in the
little-known island of Batchian. The inhabitants, "living for the most part
in the hills, kill and smoke the deer, and bring the meat into the villages
for sale. We were fortunate enough to assist at one of their hunts, in
which no other weapon than the spear is used. The side of a large ravine,
which had been partially cleared, and presented a confused jumble of fallen
trees and low brushwood, was assigned to us as our post, and, from the
extensive view it commanded, we were able later in the day to watch one run
almost from start to finish, although at first the sport appeared to be
successful in every direction but our own. At length a stag broke covert
about five hundred yards above us, and descended the slopes of the ravine,
but shortly afterwards turned and made for the forest again. He was met by
some of the hunters and driven back; but the dogs were now in full cry, and
pressed him hard, the hunters meanwhile racing at their utmost speed above,
in order to prevent his regaining the jungle. He now altered his direction,
and turned down once more towards us; but the fallen trees were so thick
that the dogs gained rapidly on him. He made one more effort for his life
by doubling, but it was too late, and in another minute the dogs and
hunters had fairly run him down."

YOUNG MALE SWAMP-DEER.

This species is the Barasingh of the natives of India. It is by no means
addicted to swampy localities.]

Deer were probably the earliest animals of the chase. Their bones are found
in the cave-dwellings of prehistoric man, and some of the earliest efforts
at drawing represent these animals.


OTHER TYPICAL DEER.

So numerous are the typical deer that they are not concluded even by the
long list of animals already enumerated. We proceed now to glance briefly
at the remainder of this important group.

The PHILIPPINE SPOTTED DEER, or PRINCE ALFRED'S DEER, is a small but
extremely handsome species, found in the islands of Samar and Leyte. The
height is under 30 inches; the colour very dark brown, spotted with white,
the under-parts, chin, and upper portion of the legs also white.

Another small cervine from the Philippine group is the CALAMIANES DEER, a
darkish brown beast, found in the island of that name.

The little BAVIAN DEER, another island-deer, from the Bavian group, between
Borneo and Java, should also be mentioned. Very little is known of the
habits of these three deer, and few specimens even of their skins and horns
have reached Europe.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

INDIAN MUNTJAC.

Sometimes called the Barking-deer. The Indian species stands only 2 feet
high.]

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford, Woburn Abbey._

YOUNG MALE CHINESE WATER-DEER.

One of the few deer which have no antlers.]

The HOG-DEER, allied to the last-named species, is an animal much better
known, found as it is in many parts of India and Burma. This handsome
little deer stands from 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder, and carries
antlers which average from 10 to 15 inches, and reach occasionally as much
as 21 or 22 inches--one specimen is recorded measuring 23¼ inches. It has a
yellowish or reddish-brown coat, minutely speckled with white. The summer
coat is paler and marked with white or palish-brown spots. This sturdy
little deer is found usually in long grass, and affords excellent
snap-shooting; it is also run into with dogs and speared by mounted
sportsmen. Major Fitz-Herbert thus describes a chase of this kind: "He [the
little stag] stood at bay, with head down and bristles raised like a
miniature red deer of Landseer's, but broke away when I came up. Once he
charged the bitch and knocked her over. He stood at bay two or three times,
but I could never get a spear into him for fear of hurting the dogs. At
last one time, as he was breaking bay, I came up, and he charged me with
such force as to break one of his horns clean off against the spear.
However, I struck him in the spine, and rolled him over." These little deer
have quite extraordinary pluck, and have been known even to charge and
wound a horse.

The CHITAL, or INDIAN SPOTTED DEER, often called the Axis Deer, a very
beautiful species, is the common jungle-stag of India. Standing about 3
feet or a little over, its lovely coat of bright reddish fawn is thickly
spotted with white at all seasons of the year. The horns are somewhat of
the sambar type, and measure as much as 36 or 38 inches in length in fine
specimens. These exquisite deer are often found in considerable herds, and
are a forest-loving species.

The SWAMP-DEER, the true Barasingh of India, as distinguished from the
Kashmir stag, which is often loosely called Barasingh, is a plain-loving
species, found in various parts of India, and characterised by handsome
antlers, bearing as many as from 10 to 16 points. This is a big, heavy
deer, standing nearly 4 feet at the withers, and weighing as much as 40
stone. The summer coat is light rufous, more or less spotted with white.
The winter coat is yellowish brown. A near relative to this deer is
SCHOMBURGK'S DEER, found in Northern Siam. The antlers of this stag are
most curiously forked and bifurcated.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

MALE SIBERIAN ROE.

A very huge species of roebuck, with more rugged antlers than the
European-roe.]

The THAMIN, or ELD'S DEER, sometimes called the Brow-antlered Deer, is
another plains-deer, found chiefly from Manipur, through Burma, to the
Malay Peninsula. It is a good-sized species, standing about 3 feet 9 inches
at the shoulder, and weighing as much as 17 stone. The large antlers are
simple in type, the brow-tines curving down curiously over the forehead;
the tail is sharp, and the neck provided with a mane, the young being
spotted. A Siamese race of Eld's deer, found in Siam and Hainan, differs
somewhat from the Burmese type.


THE MUNTJACS.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

FEMALE SIBERIAN ROE.

The absence of a tail, characteristic of all roes, is well shown.]

The MUNTJACS, or BARKING-DEER, are a group of small deer found in India,
Burma, and the Malay region. The INDIAN MUNTJAC stands about 2 feet in
height, and weighs some 28 lbs. The antlers, which average 5 or 6 inches in
length, bear two points--brow-tine and beam; the lower portions, or
pedicles, are curiously covered with hair, and the front of the face is
ribbed or ridged in V fashion. The general colour is a golden bay, the face
and limbs brown, and the lower parts white. The buck has sharp tusks in the
upper jaw, and, at a pinch, knows how to make use of them. A shy, stealthy
little creature, the muntjac loves dense cover, and the sportsman usually
obtains but a quick snapshot at this active and wary little deer as it
flashes across him much as does a bolting rabbit scuttling across a narrow
drive. Local Indian names for the barking-deer are Jungle-sheep, Red
Hog-deer, and Rib-faced Deer. Other muntjacs, varying somewhat from the
Indian form, are the HAIRY-FRONTED, the TENASSERIM, the TIBETAN, and the
CHINESE MUNTJACS.


TUFTED DEER.

Near relatives of the odd little muntjacs are the TUFTED DEER, of which two
species, the TIBETAN and MICHIE'S, are known to naturalists. The former,
found in Eastern Tibet, is about the size of the Indian muntjac, and has a
coat of dark chocolate-brown, curiously speckled on the face, neck, and
fore parts; the frontal tuft is nearly black. The antlers of the bucks of
both this and Michie's deer are extremely small, scarcely observable at a
first glance. Both species have long curving tusks projecting from the
upper jaw. Michie's tufted deer is of a greyish-black or iron-grey colour,
the face and neck dark grey. This animal is found in the reed-beds
bordering the Ningpo and other rivers in Eastern China.

SIBERIAN ROEBUCK.

Shows a magnificent pair of antlers.]


WATER-DEER.

The CHINESE WATER-DEER is another diminutive deer, standing no more than 20
inches at the shoulder. The body-colouring is pale rufous yellow, the head
and the back of the ears being darker in hue than the rest of the body. The
males carry no antlers. This tiny deer is found in North-east China, and is
well known on the islands of the Yangtse-kiang River. It loves thick cover,
especially reeds and long grass. So apt is it at concealment, that at
Woburn Abbey, where specimens are kept in a paddock of long tussocky grass,
hours may be spent without catching a glimpse of it. When disturbed, it
scurries off with short, quick leaps, very much after the manner of the
hare. The males of the Chinese deer, like the muntjacs, carry long curved
tusks in the upper jaw.


ROE DEER.

The EUROPEAN ROE, one of the handsomest of all the smaller deer, is still
happily found in many parts of Scotland. In England, where it had at one
time become well-nigh extinct, it has been here and there reintroduced with
some success. In Ireland it seems never to have been found. On the
Continent its range is wide, extending from the south of Sweden, through
France and Germany, to Italy, Greece, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, and Spain.
Found in Southern Russia and the Caucasus, it makes its way eastward as far
as North Palestine and Persia. The roe stands, in good adult specimens, 26
inches at the shoulder, and weighs about 60 lbs. The handsome and very
characteristic horns measure in good specimens from 10 to 13 inches over
the outer curve. The summer coat of this beautiful little deer is a bright
rufous brown; in winter a darker and duller brown, with a notable white
patch about the tail. The roe is always more or less a wood-loving
creature. In winter, especially, it seldom cares to quit the shelter of the
forest; in summer, however, the deer wander into more open localities. The
fawns are born generally towards the end of May, and two young are usually
produced. In the rutting-season the males fight savagely with one another.

FEMALE EUROPEAN ROE DEER.

Though common in the Scotch woods, these deer are rarely seen, keeping
close in cover all day.]

Mr. J. G. Millais gives an instance of a buck killed in one of these
desperate battles, in which one antler of the victor, having penetrated the
brain of the vanquished buck, had been broken clean off and remained
embedded in the skull, firmly wedged between the ears and the antlers.
"When wounded and brought to bay by a dog," says Mr. Millais, "a roebuck
brings into play both head and fore legs in his defence, using his horns as
described, and striking out with his legs, more as if to push off his
antagonist than to cause a forcible blow, for he gives no shock, as a hind
can. A doe, too, uses her fore legs and boxes with her head; and Mr. Steel,
who has had wide experience in roe-shooting, tells me that he has seen a
doe use her hind legs as well. The bark of the buck is loud, sharp, and
deep in tone, not unlike what a single call might be from an old collie. At
this season, too, the female gives an amorous call when she wishes the male
to come to her. If he is within hearing, he puts his neck out straight and
comes full speed to her. In Germany many roebucks are shot by alluring them
in this manner, and calls exactly imitating her voice are made for the
sportsman's use. One who has shot roe in this manner tells me it is most
exciting sport, for the buck comes straight for the sound at full speed,
and will only stop startled for a second when he discovers the fraud, and
as often as not he passes right on without giving a chance."

PÈRE DAVID'S DEER.

Nineteen of these deer are at Woburn Abbey; three are at Berlin. It is
believed that these are the only deer of this species in existence.]

Roe have a curious trick of chasing one another in play, and certain
roe-rings in the woods near Cawdor Castle, according to Mr. Millais,
demonstrate the fact that for ages the deer have been in the habit of
disporting themselves in these strange circles over the same pieces of
ground. The fact is very singular. "These curious circles are most used in
early summer; and Sutherland, the head keeper, tells me," says Mr. Millais,
"that hardly a morning passes without there being one or two roe playing in
the rings, and sometimes there is quite a party of them." Roe feed chiefly
on grass; they will eat also rowan (mountain-ash) berries, of which they
are especially fond, as well as turnips, grain, heather tops, and various
other roots and plants. Certain fungi, to which they are partial, they take
much pains to dig out with their sharp hoofs. "A roebuck that I once kept,"
says Mr. Millais, "was a good Scotchman, though he had a beastly temper,
for he liked nothing so much as oatmeal porridge." Roe make delightful
pets, but the bucks are not to be trusted after the third year. One of
these animals, supposed to be tame, has been known to kill a lad. In
Scotland and on the Continent roe deer are usually killed by driving, and
large bags are often made. Even within recent times, as many as sixty-five
roebucks and thirteen hinds have been shot at Beaufort, Lord Lovat's place
in Inverness-shire, during a day's driving. Shot-guns are employed for this
kind of sport. Stalking the roe is not so much pursued in Scotland as it
might be. It is a first-rate and most interesting form of sport, and in
certain districts the rifle might very well be substituted for the
shot-gun. "Roe-stalking," says Mr. Millais, "possesses many charms of its
own. In the first place, you can enjoy it at a season when there is no
other shooting going on; secondly, it takes you out in the early morning,
when all nature is full of life and beauty, and before the heat of the day
commences; and, thirdly, where the chase of the animal is systematically
conducted, as with red deer, the nature of the sport is everything that can
be desired. I would therefore put forward a plea that tenants and owners of
part-wood, part-forest lands in Argyll, Inverness, Ross, and Aberdeen
should turn their attention to stalking the roe in preference to killing
them during the usual winter wood-shoots." Roe deer are exceedingly
abundant in the great forest regions of Germany and Austria-Hungary. In
Austria alone, not including Hungary, during the year 1892, no less than
68,110 of these beautiful little deer were shot on various estates.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

GROUP OF VIRGINIAN DEER (TWO BUCKS, FOUR DOES).

These are the common deer of the Eastern United States.]

The SIBERIAN ROE, found from the mountains of the Altai and Turkestan to
Siberia, is a somewhat larger species than its European cousin, measuring
from 28 to 34 inches at the shoulder. The antlers are also larger,
extending to as much as 16 and even 18 inches in measurement. As beseems
its habitat, the coat of this species is also thicker and rougher than is
the case with the European roe. Mr. Lydekker gives some interesting
particulars regarding this animal: "When the snows of November fall, the
roe themselves commence to collect in herds, which may number from 300 to
500 head, and soon after migrate southwards into Manchuria, whence they
return about the end of March or beginning of April. On the Ussuri, which
they must cross, they are at this season slaughtered in thousands by the
hunters, without regard to age or sex."

One other species, the MANCHURIAN ROE, found chiefly in mountainous
habitats, whence it never descends, should be noted. This is a smaller deer
than the Siberian roe, and approximates in size and length of horn to the
European race.


PÈRE DAVID'S DEER.

This remarkable animal, which apparently bears little or no resemblance to
any of the other deer of the Old World, has been placed by some naturalists
between the roe deer and the American deer. Its habitat is North China,
and, strangely enough, it seems to be unrecognised in the wild state, being
apparently only known in China in the Imperial Park at Pekin. This deer
approaches in size the red deer of Europe. The general colouring is greyish
brown, white about the eyes, ears, rump, and under-parts; the horns, which
lack the brow-tine, are very singular in shape, and measure as much as 32
inches in length; the tail is long, reaching to the hocks; the gait is
"lolloping" and mule-like. This is a marsh-loving species, and at Woburn
Abbey, where specimens are kept, "they may be seen wading far into the
lakes and even swimming in the deeper water."

A MULE-DEER FAWN.

The large ears, from which the American species takes its name, are
noticeable even in the young.]


THE AMERICAN DEER.

Excepting always the elk, wapiti, and reindeer, which have been already
described, the deer of North and South America stand quite apart from those
of the Old World, and are placed in a genus of their own. Usually the tail
is long, and the brow-tine is always wanting. The most familiar species is
the common AMERICAN DEER, of which the VIRGINIAN or WHITE-TAILED DEER is
the type. This deer is found in varying forms in both continents, and was
regularly hunted by the ancient Mexicans with trained pumas.

The well-known VIRGINIAN DEER, found in Eastern North America, and believed
to range as far south as Louisiana, stands a trifle over 3 feet in height,
and weighs, clean, about 12 stone 7 lbs. The coloration is chestnut in
summer, bluish grey in winter. The antlers are of good size, and measure as
much as 27½ inches in length. As a sporting animal the white-tailed deer is
not popular. Mr. Clive Phillipps-Wolley describes him as "an exasperating
little beast." possessing every quality which a deer ought not to, from the
sportsman's point of view. "His haunts are river-bottoms, in choking,
blinding bush, and his habits are beastly. No one could ever expect to
stalk a white-tail; if you want to get one, you must crawl." Mr. Selous, in
1897, bagged one of these deer somewhat curiously. "He was coming," he
writes, "through the scrubby, rather open bush straight towards me in a
series of great leaps, rising, I think, quite four feet from the ground at
every bound. I stood absolutely still, thinking to fire at him just as he
jumped the stream and passed me. However, he came so straight to me that,
had he held his course, he must have jumped on to or over me. But when
little more than the width of the stream separated us--when he was
certainly not more than ten yards from me--he either saw or winded me, and,
without a moment's halt, made a prodigious leap sideways. I fired at him
when he was in the air, and I believe quite six feet above the ground." The
deer, an old buck with a good head, was afterwards picked up dead. In
different parts of America, as far south as Peru and Bolivia, various local
races of this deer are to be found.

TRUE'S DEER is a small species, not unlike the Virginian deer, found from
South Mexico to Costa Rica. The antlers are "in the form of simple spikes
directed backwards," and the body-colouring is in summer light chestnut, in
winter brownish grey. Little is at present known of this species.

The MULE-DEER, found in most parts of North America west of the Missouri,
as far south as Southern California, stands about 3 feet 3 inches at the
shoulder, and weighs over 17 stone clean. It carries good antlers,
measuring as much as 30 inches, and in colour is tawny red in summer,
brownish grey in winter. It is a far better sporting animal than the
sneaking white-tailed deer, and affords excellent stalking. These deer are
still abundant in many localities. Mr. Phillipps-Wolley writes thus of them
in "Big Game Shooting": "Some idea of the number of these deer in British
Columbia may be gathered from the fact that in one district I have had a
chance of killing seventeen separate stags in an hour's still hunt, whilst
one settler in the Similkameen country fed his hogs on deer-meat through a
whole winter." Four races of mule-deer--the TYPICAL, the CALIFORNIAN, the
LA PAZ, and the WESTERN DESERT race--have been identified by naturalists.

The BLACK-TAILED DEER is another well-known cervine of Western North
America, closely allied to the mule-deer, but distinguished from that
species by its inferior size and its much blacker tail. The antlers, as a
rule, run somewhat smaller than in the case of the mule-deer. This, too, is
a very abundant species, affording fairly good sport (considering its
liking for timber and dense bush) and excellent venison.

In South America are to be found several kinds of marsh-deer, of which the
best known is the handsome MARSH-DEER, having its range from Brazil to the
forest country of the Argentine Republic. Little is known of this and other
South American deer by British sportsmen. The marsh-deer is almost equal in
size to the red deer of Scotland, but somewhat less stout of build; the
colouring is bright chestnut in summer, brown in winter; the coat is long
and coarse, as befits a swamp-loving creature; the antlers usually display
ten points, and measure in fine specimens as much as 23 or 24 inches.

The PAMPAS-DEER, a species closely allied to the marsh-deer, is of small
size, standing about 2 feet 6 inches at the shoulder. The antlers, usually
three-pointed, measure no more than from 12 to 14 inches in fine specimens.
This deer is found from Brazil to Northern Patagonia.

[Illustration: _By permission of Professor Bumpus_]     [_New York._

VIRGINIAN DEER.

This deer is the best-known representative of a species displaying
extraordinary local variation in size and colour.]

The PERUVIAN and CHILIAN GUEMALS are small deer, found on the high Andes,
and are somewhat inferior in size to the Virginian deer. The males carry
simple antlers forming a single fork, and measuring about 9 inches. The
coat, yellowish brown in hue, is coarse, thick, and brittle. The Chilian
guemal is found also in most parts of Patagonia; unlike its congener of
Peru, which delights in altitudes of from 14,000 to 16,000 feet, its
habitat lies chiefly in deep valleys, thick forest, and even the adjacent
plains, to which it resorts in winter.

The BROCKETS, of which seven species are found in South and Central America
and Trinidad, are small deer, having spike-like antlers and tufted crowns.
The largest is the RED BROCKET, found in Guiana, Brazil, and Paraguay,
which stands 27 inches at the shoulder. The body-colouring is brownish red.
Like most of the group, this brocket is extremely shy; although fond of
dense covert, it is found also on open campos. The PYGMY BROCKET, a tiny
dark brown deerlet, less than 19 inches in height, found in Central Brazil,
is the smallest of these very small deer.

Two other diminutive deer, known as PUDUS, closely allied to the brockets,
are found in South America. These are the CHILIAN and ECUADOR PUDUS, of
which the former is no more than 13½ inches in height, the latter about 14
or 15 inches. Little is known of the history and life habits of these
charming little creatures, one of which, the Chilian species, has
occasionally been seen in the Zoological Society's Gardens.


THE MUSK-DEER.

This brief account of the deer of the world closes with the MUSK-DEER,
which differ from almost all others of their kind--the Chinese water-deer
being the sole exception--in the absence of antlers. In place of these
defensive and offensive weapons, nature has provided the musk-deer with
long canine tusks, projecting downwards from the upper jaw. The musk, from
which these curious deer take their name, is secreted during the
rutting-season--in the male only--in a pouch or gland contained in the skin
of the stomach.

The well-known HIMALAYAN MUSK-DEER is a stout, heavily made deer for its
size, measuring 20 inches at the shoulder, about 2 inches higher at the
rump, and having a coat of coarse, brittle hair of a dark brown colour.
This musk-deer, which is nowadays by no means common, is found in the
forests of the Himalaya, Tibet, Siberia, and Western China, often at
altitudes of about 8,000 feet. These animals are extraordinary
mountaineers, active, daring, and apparently quite unconscious of or
indifferent to danger.

Another species, the KANSU MUSK-DEER, found in the province of Kansu,
China, has only been discovered within the last ten years. Concerning this
deer very little is at present known. In general characteristics it
resembles its more familiar congener of the Himalaya.

A WORD should be said upon the subject of the acclimatisation of various
members of the Deer Tribe in countries which are distant from their native
ground, but in which they are found to thrive and breed, some with greater
and some with less success. It will be seen that several of the
illustrations in this chapter are taken from deer living in natural
conditions at Woburn Abbey, the seat of the Duke of Bedford. Others were
photographed out of doors in zoological parks or private menageries. There
is a considerable degree of transferability among deer, not only among
those found in temperate or northern regions, but also those which inhabit
the tropical jungles of Southern India.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

YOUNG MARSH-DEER.

A very elegant South American species. The main colour is a bright
chestnut, with the lower part of the legs black. The insides of the ears
are filled with white hair, looking like silver filigree.]

The Axis, or Chital Deer of India, is the most striking example. It lives
in the hot jungles, where it is the usual food of the tiger. Yet it has
been transferred to the forests of France and to English parks, and not
only lives, but breeds and increases in numbers. It is kept in this country
mainly at Woburn Abbey, and at Haggerston Castle, in Northumberland. In
France and Germany herds of axis deer have been maintained long enough to
observe a curious and noteworthy incident in acclimatisation. The axis deer
breeds naturally in October, after the Indian rainy season. This habit, if
persisted in in Europe, would expose the fawn to the rigours of the French
or English winter. Gradually and after some time the herds become irregular
in the time of reproduction, and later produce the fawns in June, at the
time which is best suited to their survival. This is a real instance of
acclimatisation.

The Japanese Deer, or Sika, was introduced into the park at Powerscourt by
Viscount Powerscourt some thirty years ago. Now it is one of the commonest
of recently introduced park-deer both in this country and in France. The
venison is excellent, and the herds are prolific. The stags are small, but
very strong, and at Powerscourt always get the better of the red deer
stags, and sometimes carry off their hinds. Wapiti Deer are kept in several
English parks, but so far the Sambar has proved a failure. Hog-deer and
Chinese Water-deer do very well both in England and France.

But it is in New Zealand that the best results have been obtained with
imported deer. The English Red Deer, some of which were originally sent out
by the Prince Consort, reinforced by some of the same species bred in
Australia, have become indigenous. They grow far faster and to a larger
size than those on the Scotch moors, and rival the great stags of the
Carpathians. The antlers also increase in size at an abnormal rate.
Licences are regularly issued to stalk and shoot these deer, which, like
the brown trout and the pheasant, are now among the stock of established
wild fauna. Moose and a few Sambar stags and herds have also been turned
out in New Zealand. The latter are said to be doing well.

There is no particular reason why the deer of cold countries should not be
interchanged; they seem to have the natural adaptability of oxen. But it is
not a little surprising that the species from warm climates should flourish
in damp and cold ones. The axis deer would be a real addition to the fauna
of the great European forests, if it is found that it survives the winter
snows without some form of artificial shelter. No one seems to have
considered the advisability of introducing the mule-deer into the Central
European woods. It is a much finer animal than the fallow buck, and the
venison is excellent. In those woods where fallow deer are preserved in a
wild state, as on many of the German Emperor's sporting-estates, the
mule-deer would be a far more ornamental animal. Few people know what
immense herds of red and fallow deer, as well as of wild boars, still
exist, under careful preservation, in the forests of the great German,
Austrian, and Russian princes, and in the royal forests of their respective
countries.

YOUNG HIMALAYAN MUSK-DEER.

The male carries a pouch on the abdomen, from which the musk is obtained.
There are no antlers.]

When the Kaiser holds his great Court hunting-parties, to which the guests
all come dressed in the uniform of the Order of St. Hubert, as many as 200
deer are shot in a day. They are driven past the guns by beaters. After the
day's sport is over all the antlers are wreathed with boughs of spruce fir,
and the stags laid out like rabbits after an English battue.

It is rather surprising that only one species of deer has been entirely
domesticated--viz. the Reindeer. Deer's meat is as highly prized as that of
any other game, perhaps even more so. There is almost no part of the animal
which is not useful. The horns are valuable for knife-handles, and always
command a good price; they were prized even by prehistoric man, who
converted them into pick-axes, and made spear-heads and daggers of them.
The leather of the hide makes the softest and best of all hunting-garments:
the American Indian or trapper always wears, or used to wear, a deer-skin
shirt and deer-skin leggings, made as exquisitely soft as chamois leather
by a process known to the squaws. At the present time all the best gloves
are made of doe-skin; they are far the most costly of any gloves. Doe-skin
breeches are also a luxurious garment to ride in. For ornamental rugs few
skins beat those of the Dappled Deer, laid on the floor of some finely
furnished hall or room.

Thus we have the curious spectacle of the wild men of the Far North, the
Lapps and Ostiaks, taming and keeping in domestication great herds of deer,
milking them, using them as beasts of draught, and feeding on their flesh,
while far more civilised races in the South have not taken the trouble to
do so. The reason is not easy to surmise, unless it be that the idea of
making use of the Deer Tribe solely as beasts of the chase was so rooted in
the European ruling races, and their kings and nobles, that the
agriculturist never had a chance of trying to tame and use them for other
purposes. It is certain that during the Middle Ages law and custom made any
such attempt quite impossible. The deer were a valuable sporting asset, so
hedged round with an atmosphere of feudal privilege, that to convert them
into something useful to the common people would have been regarded as an
insult to the powers that were.

THE CAMEL-PLOUGH, USED IN ALGIERS.

Camels are often used for agricultural purposes in North Africa, Syria, and
India. In this particular case a special kind of plough is employed.]

CHAPTER XVIII.

_THE CAMEL TRIBE AND THE CHEVROTAINS._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

The Camels and Llamas, constituting the present group, form a very distinct
section of the great assemblage of animals known as the Ruminants, or
Cud-chewers. The Camel Tribe are peculiar amongst the Ruminants in that
they never possess horns, and in that the stomach is only divided into
three instead of four compartments--this division into compartments being
intimately connected with the ruminating habit. Furthermore, the upper jaw
bears cutting-teeth, or "front teeth," as they are popularly called: though
the full set (three pairs) is only complete in the young, in the adult but
one pair remains, the others being shed. The canine or "eye" teeth are also
peculiar in their position, those of the lower jaw being separated from the
cutting-teeth by a very considerable gap.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

A WHITE CAMEL.

A light sandy is the common colour, though white, grey, brown, and black
occur; but black camels are held by the Arabs to be worthless.]

In the structure of the feet the Camel Tribe are no less peculiar; indeed,
it is on this character that the scientific name of the group is founded.
Only two toes are present; these are of equal size, and, instead of being
protected by hoofs, are provided with a hardened skin, covering a
cushion-like pad, which expands when the weight of the body is thrown upon
the foot, as in walking. This is an admirable adaptation for walking on
soft and yielding sands. Hoofs are represented only by a pair of broad
nails.

[Illustration: _Photo by Charles Knight_]     [_Aldershot._

ARABIAN CAMEL.

This individual belongs to the heavy breed employed for carrying
merchandise and baggage.]

The three-chambered stomach is remarkable because the chamber known as the
"paunch" lodges in its walls a large collection of "water-cells," in which
can be stored as much as a gallon and a half of water. This faculty of
storing water is invaluable to an animal which has often to subsist for
days on absolutely waterless deserts.

Note the slit-like nostrils in the illustration of the Bactrian Camel on
page 306. These can be closed at the will of the animal, a useful
precaution against the entrance of sand during the violent sand-storms
which often arise in the desert.

The True Camels are distinguished by the possession of a hump or humps:
there are never more than two. It is in these humps that the camel was
popularly supposed to store water; in reality they are huge masses of fat,
serving as a reserve store of food. The accumulation of fat for this
purpose is a common feature amongst the Mammalia. Most animals which
hibernate, or lay up and sleep during the winter, store up fat; but, except
in the camel, it is distributed more or less evenly over the body. With
hard work or bad feeding the camel's hump dwindles almost to nothing. When
on the eve of a long journey, the Arab looks anxiously to the state of this
hump, for on the size of this depends the animal's condition and ability to
undertake the march.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

A CAMEL.

A half-breed between the Arabian and Bactrian species.]

The Arabian camel as a wild animal has long since been extinct. Of the
hordes of so-called wild camels which abound in the desert regions of
Central Asia (Gobi Steppe), some are probably descendants of domesticated
animals which have escaped from captivity, but others may be aboriginally
wild. From the evidence of fossil camels, there seems little doubt that
this animal originated in North America--one branch of the family (the
Llamas) migrating into South America, and the other (the Camels) crossing
Bering Sea into the Old World.


THE TRUE CAMEL.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

A STRING OF CAMELS NEAR PORT SAID.

These are the typical desert-camels of the East.]

Before proceeding further, it may be well to refer to the confusion which
exists in the use of the names Camel and Dromedary. The latter name seems
popularly to be applied to the two-humped species, the name Camel being
reserved for the one with a single hump. This is a mistake. The DROMEDARY
is a swift breed of riding-camel of the one-humped species, and is so
called to distinguish it from its slower brother, the Pack-camel, or
Baggage-camel. The pack-camel, it is interesting to note, has been
introduced into Australia, where it has proved invaluable in crossing the
vast waterless deserts, on account of its power to exist for long periods
without drinking.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

HEAD OF BACTRIAN CAMEL.

The hair of this species is used to felt into material for tents. It is
longest on the top of the head, neck, humps, and parts of the fore limbs.]

The TRUE or ARABIAN CAMEL is found in a domesticated state in Africa and
Asia, and, as we have just indicated, belongs to the one-humped species. It
is a long-limbed, short-haired animal, standing as much as 7 feet high. As
a wild animal it is extinct. Much mystery, indeed, surrounds the question
of its origin. It has been suggested that the Arabian camel, or its
immediate parent, may have sprung from an Indian ancestor, and thence made
its way through Arabia and Syria into Northern Africa.

Not only is the camel indispensable as a beast of burden, but it is
esteemed also for its hair, its flesh, bones, and milk. The hair is woven
into cloth. In some parts of India the bones are used instead of ivory for
inlaid work. The milk is unusually thick and rich, so much so that it
cannot be used for tea or coffee, as it curdles when mixed with either.

The camel is popularly supposed to be a very docile animal; but those who
speak from experience declare it to be stupid, surly, and vicious to the
last degree. It is, however, not entirely void of understanding, and
apparently cherishes feelings of revenge, as the following story shows: "A
camel, working in an oil-mill, was severely beaten by its driver.
Perceiving that the camel had treasured up the injury, and was only waiting
a favourable opportunity for revenge, he kept a strict watch upon the
animal. Time passed away; the camel, perceiving it was watched, was quiet
and obedient, and the driver began to think the beating was forgotten, when
one night, after the lapse of several months, the man was sleeping on a
raised platform in the mill, whilst the camel, as is customary, was stabled
in a corner. Happening to awake, the driver observed by the bright
moonlight that, when all was quiet, the animal looked cautiously round,
rose softly, and, stealing towards a spot where a bundle of clothes and a
bernous, thrown carelessly on the ground, resembled a sleeping figure, cast
itself with violence upon them, rolling with all its weight, and tearing
them most viciously with its teeth. Satisfied that revenge was complete,
the camel was returning to its corner, when the driver sat up and spoke. At
the sound of his voice, perceiving the mistake it had made, the animal was
so mortified at the failure and discovery of its scheme, that it dashed its
head against the wall and died on the spot."

It is said that when camels pass a mounted man in a narrow path they will
turn their heads suddenly round and endeavour to inflict a bite on the
rider's arm or shoulder. This is naturally much dreaded, as a camel's bite
is particularly severe.

Much care has been spent in the breeding of the camel. "In the Sahara
Desert," says Canon Tristram, "the Tourareg is as careful in the selection
of his breeding mahari (a fine race of the dromedary) as the Arab is in
that of his horse. The pedigrees are handed down, and many a dromedary can
boast a genealogy far longer than the descendants of the Darley Arabian"

THE BACTRIAN CAMEL.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

AN OLD MALE BACTRIAN CAMEL.

This animal is a magnificent representative of the two-humped species, so
widely distributed in Central Asia.]

This species is often called the Dromedary; but, as we have already
remarked, this is an error. The dromedary is a swift breed of the Arabian
camel. The BACTRIAN CAMEL may be distinguished from its Arabian relative by
the fact that it has two humps, is shorter in the leg and heavier, and has
longer hair and stouter and harder feet. The shorter legs are distinctly
advantageous, enabling the animal to get about with ease and safety over
rocky and hilly ground.

BACTRIAN CAMEL.

The most useful transport animal of Central Asia.]

The hordes of wild camels found in Turkestan, in the neighbourhood of
Kashgar, are believed by Major C. S. Cumberland to be descended from camels
which escaped when the district known as Takla Makan was buried in a great
sand-storm 200 years ago. From the fury of that storm it is said no human
being escaped alive. Some camels apparently did, perhaps owing their
survival to the power they possess of closing the nostrils, and thereby
keeping out the sand.

The Bactrian camel lives upon the salt and bitter plants of the steppes,
which are rejected by almost all other animals. It is further able to drink
brackish water from the salt lakes by which it is surrounded. When pressed
by hunger, it will even eat felt blankets, bones and skins of other
animals, and fish!


THE LLAMAS.

THE LLAMAS are humpless camels, and confined to the western and
southernmost parts of South America. Two wild and two domesticated species
are known. The name Llama, it should be mentioned, properly belongs to the
domesticated animal of that name.


THE VICUÑA.

This is the smaller of the two wild species. Vicuñas live in herds in the
mountain-ranges of Peru, dwelling during the wet season high up amid rocks
and precipices, near the region of perpetual snow. In the dry season they
descend to the higher valleys. Their capture is a matter of great
difficulty; for, apart from the inaccessible nature of their haunts, they
are exceedingly shy and vigilant. They are clothed in a woolly coat of
extremely delicate texture, much in demand for weaving purposes.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

YOUNG BACTRIAN CAMEL.

The two humps are just beginning to grow.]

The baby vicuña, it is interesting to note, is able to run swiftly directly
after its birth, and possesses great powers of endurance. This is the more
noteworthy since the young of the camel are exceedingly helpless.

Vicuñas are hunted by the Indians and captured by driving them into an
enclosure of perhaps half a mile in diameter. This is hung round with bits
of coloured rag, which, fluttering in the wind, appear to deter the
captives from breaking through.


THE GUANACO.

This is larger than the vicuña, and is described as an elegant animal,
being possessed of a long, slender, gracefully curved neck and fine legs.
It ranges from the highlands of the Andes to the plains of Patagonia and
the islands of Tierra del Fuego. As Mr. Darwin points out, the behaviour of
guanaco when alarmed is very contradictory. At one time they will sound the
danger-signal, and put themselves out of harm's way long before the enemy
has perceived them; at another they exhibit the most extraordinary
curiosity, and pay the death-penalty in consequence. "That they are curious
is certain; for if a person lies on the ground and plays strange antics,
such as throwing up his feet in the air, they will almost always approach
by degrees to reconnoitre him. It was an artifice that was repeatedly
practised by our sportsmen with success, and it had, moreover, the
advantage of allowing several shots to be fired, which were all taken as
part of the performance. On the mountains of Tierra del Fuego, I have more
than once seen a guanaco, on being approached, not only neigh and squeal,
but prance and leap about in the most ridiculous manner, apparently in
defiance, as a challenge. These animals are very easily domesticated, and I
have seen some thus kept in Northern Patagonia near a house, though not
under any restraint. They are in this state very bold, and readily attack a
man by striking him from behind with both knees. The wild guanacos,
however, have no idea of defence; even a single dog will secure one of
these large animals till the huntsmen can come up. In many of their habits
they are like sheep in a flock. Thus, when they see men approaching in
several directions on horseback, they soon become bewildered, and know not
which way to run. This greatly facilitates the Indian method of hunting,
for they are thus easily driven to a central point, and are encompassed."

GUANACO.

The wild original of the llama and alpaca.]

Guanacos readily take to the water, and have been frequently seen swimming
from one island to another. Here again the llamas differ from the camels,
for these can swim but little, if at all. Like the Bactrian camel, the
guanaco can drink salt water with impunity.

One of the most remarkable traits of the guanaco is that which induces it,
when it feels its end to be near, to seek out the dying-place of the tribe,
and there breathe out its last. "The guanacos," says Mr. Darwin, "appear to
have favourite spots for lying down to die. On the banks of the St. Cruz,
in certain circumscribed places, which were generally bushy and all near
the river, the ground was actually white with bones. On one such spot I
counted between ten and twenty heads.... The animals in most cases must
have crawled, before dying, beneath and amongst the bushes."


THE LLAMA.

This is the first of the two domesticated offshoots of the guanaco, the
other being the Alpaca. The LLAMA is a larger beast than the guanaco, and
variable in colour. The ancient Peruvians bred it as a beast of burden or
for riding, and before the Spanish conquest kept it in enormous numbers.
Soon after the Spanish conquest "it was not uncommon to meet droves of from
300 to 500, or even 1,000 llamas, each laden with silver ingots, and the
whole in charge of a single native.... Only the male llamas were used as
beasts of burden, while the smaller females were kept for their milk and
flesh. In travelling along the roads, the droves marched in single file,
under the guidance of a leader; and such a line would traverse the highest
passes of the Cordillera, and skirt the most stupendous precipices with
perfect safety.... The Spanish conquerors of Peru spoke of llama-flesh as
being fully equal to the best mutton, and they established shops in the
towns for its regular sale. At the time of the conquest it is estimated
that upwards of 300,000 llamas were employed in the transport of the
product of the mines of Potosi alone."


THE ALPACA.

This animal is bred solely for the sake of its wool, which is of great
length and fineness. From it is made the well-known fabric which bears, in
consequence, the name "alpaca."

The alpaca is kept in herds on the high grounds of Bolivia and South Peru,
whence it is annually driven down to be sheared. The Incas dyed the
wool--which is of two qualities, a fine and a coarse--with bright colours,
and made it up into cloth or blankets, as the occasion served.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

LLAMAS.

Largely used as beasts of burden in Peru, where these and the alpaca were
formerly the only domesticated ruminants.]

The earliest account of this animal is by Augustin de Zarate, the
Treasurer-General of Peru in 1544. He speaks of the beast as a sheep; but
since he describes it as camel-like in shape, though devoid of a hump,
there can be no doubt that it is the llama he is describing. He says: "In
places where there is no snow the natives want water, and to supply this
they fill the skins of sheep with water, and make other living sheep carry
them; for, it must be remarked, these sheep of Peru are large enough to
serve as beasts of burden. They can carry about 100 lbs. or more, and the
Spaniards used to ride them, and they would go four or five leagues a day.
When they are weary, they lie down on the ground; and as there are no means
of making them get up, either by beating or assisting them, the load must
of necessity be taken off. When there is a man on one of them, if the beast
be tired and urged to go on, he turns his head round and discharges his
saliva, which has an unpleasant odour, into the rider's face. These animals
are of great use and profit to their masters, for their wool is very good
and fine ... and the expense of their food is trifling, as a handful of
maize suffices them, and they can go four or five days without water. Their
flesh is as good as that of the fat sheep of Castile. There are now public
shambles for the sale of their flesh in all parts of Peru, which was not
the case when the Spaniards came first."

THE CHEVROTAINS.

Mention must be made, before passing to the Pig Tribe, of the smallest of
hoofed mammals, the Royal Antelope excepted--the CHEVROTAINS. These little
animals are hornless, and intermediate in character between the Deer,
Camels, and Pigs. The males have large canine teeth, like those of the
Musk-deer, with which the Chevrotains have long been confounded. The range
of these animals, of which there are five species known, extends from India
and Ceylon, through the Malayan countries, as far east as the island of
Palawan, in the Philippine group. One species, the largest of the group,
occurs on the west coast of Africa.

_THE PIG AND HIPPOPOTAMUS._

----

THE PIG TRIBE.

BY H. A. BRYDEN.

Many species and varieties of swine are found in different parts of the
world, most of them exhibiting strong traces of a general family
resemblance, although widely sundered as to habitats and often markedly
differing in outward appearance. All are omnivorous; all have the stomach
simpler in type than in the Ruminants; and all have front or incisor teeth
in the upper jaw. The two great families of swine proper are the Pigs and
Peccaries.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

A DOMESTICATED SOW AND HER PROGENY.

The absence of stripes and spots on the young is a feature in which they
differ from those of nearly all wild swine.]

There has been much discussion among scientists as to the early origin of
the various breeds of domestic swine found in different parts of the world.
There can be little doubt that, although selective breeding has produced
extraordinary differences in outward appearance, even among the domestic
pigs of our own islands, the origin of the numerous tame races is to be
sought in the ancestry of the wild breeds of the countries in which they
are found. Darwin has some very apposite remarks on the differences to be
observed in domesticated swine. "The peculiar form of the skull and body in
the most highly cultivated races is," he observes, "not characteristic of
any one race, but is common to all when improved up to the same standard.
Thus the large-bodied, long-eared English breed, with a convex back, and
the small-bodied, short-eared Chinese breeds, with a concave back, when
bred to the same state of perfection, nearly resemble each other in the
form of the head and body. This result, it appears, is partly due to
similar causes of change acting on the several races, and partly to man
breeding the pig for one sole purpose--namely, for the greatest amount of
flesh and fat; so that selection has always tended towards one and the same
end. With most domestic animals the result of selection has been divergence
of character; here it has been convergence."

WILD BOAR.

In its long, bristly hair and powerful lower tusks, the wild boar is a very
different animal from its domesticated descendants.]


THE TRUE PIGS.

True pigs are found only in the Old World, and even there in very widely
different forms. Typical of these quadrupeds is the well-known WILD BOAR,
found abundantly in many parts of Europe, North Africa, Asia Minor, and
Central Asia. In the British Islands the wild boar must once have been
extraordinarily plentiful, especially in Ireland, where its tame
descendants still so greatly flourish. In the days of the Plantagenets wild
swine fed and sheltered in the woodlands close to London. James I. hunted
them near Windsor in 1617, and even down to the year 1683 these animals
still had their haunts in the more secluded parts of England. Although now
extinct in these Islands, the wild boar is to be found plentifully at the
present day in France, Germany, Austria, Russia, and Spain, Greece,
Albania, and other countries of the Mediterranean. In most parts of Europe
the wild boar is shot during forest drives, but in the Caucasus and round
the Black Sea the hardy peasants lie in wait for these animals by the
fruit-trees on autumn nights or waylay them going to the water and shoot
them single-handed. Many an old Cossack, writes Mr. Clive Phillipps-Wolley,
bears the scars of some desperate encounter with these formidable foes. In
Spain, where in the old days the boar was pursued by cavaliers with spear
and pike, it is still, in the forests of Estremadura, followed with horse
and hound, usually, says Mr. Abel Chapman, "during the stillness of a
moonlight night, when the acorns are falling from the oaks in the
magnificent Estremenian woods."

DIVING-PIGS.

Half-wild pigs, found in Florida, where they live on refuse fish. (See next
page)]

In India the wild boar of Europe and North Africa is replaced by a closely
allied species (distinguished by a crest of long black bristles upon the
neck and back), which furnishes some of the finest and most exciting sport
in the world to mounted hunters armed with a sharp spear. There is not a
pluckier or more fearless beast living than the boar; and as he carries
long and extremely sharp tusks, and never scruples to use them, he is an
exceedingly dangerous opponent when wounded and enraged. Severe and even
fatal accidents have happened in the pursuit of this determined beast of
chase. When at bay, the boar is absolutely reckless of life; and although
pierced and mortally wounded by the spear, will yet force himself up the
shaft, and with his dying effort inflict gaping wounds on the horse bearing
his attacker. Indian shikaris, to illustrate the courage of the wild boar,
say that he has the hardihood to drink at a river between two tigers; and
Colonel R. Heber Percy mentions, in the Badminton volumes on "Big Game
Shooting," that "several cases are on record in which an old boar has
beaten off a tiger, and some in which the latter has been killed by a boar.
The boar's extraordinary activity and sharp tusks make him no mean
adversary, and his short neck makes it difficult for a tiger to seize it
and give it that fatal wrench with which he likes to polish off his
victims." A wild boar will stand as much as 3 feet at the shoulder--some
sportsmen affirm considerably more--and weigh more than 300 lbs. The finest
boar's tusk known is one mentioned in Rowland Ward's "Records of Big Game."
This measures 11½ inches over the curve. It came from the Caucasus, and is
in the possession of Colonel Veernhof.

It is worthy of note that, while the full-grown individuals of the various
species of wild swine are uniformly coloured, their young are
longitudinally striped and spotted. In India, besides the common boar, a
tiny wild swine, known as the PYGMY HOG, is found in the Bhutan Terai and
the forests of Nepal and Sikhim. This pig, which is little bigger than a
fox-terrier, runs in considerable troops, or sounders, and is said to
attack intruders into its domain much in the same fearless way in which the
peccary of America defends its sanctuaries. The height of this diminutive
species is given as from 8 to 10 inches--the weight at 10 lbs.

Wild swine are nocturnal in their habits, frequenting moist and marshy
country, loving the shade of forests, and making their lairs in tall grass,
reed-beds, and similar covert. They go far afield for their food-supplies,
and do a great deal of damage to crops in cultivated districts. The
European wild sow produces from six to ten young, and at least two litters
are usually brought forth in the year.

It is remarkable how quickly pigs, as well as other domesticated animals,
revert to a semi-feral state of existence, and develop habits suited to a
fresh environment. Mr. J. Turner-Turner sends us the following interesting
note in connection with this trait: "DIVING-PIGS.--These pigs live in an
almost wild condition on certain of the islands off Florida, and subsist
chiefly upon the refuse fish cast away by the netsmen. To obtain this, the
pigs dive under water, walking on the land at a depth of 5 feet below the
surface."

Among other Asiatic wild swine are to be mentioned the COLLARED PIG, found
in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo; the WHITE-WHISKERED JAPANESE PIG; the PAPUAN
and FORMOSAN PIGS; the WARTY PIG of Java and Borneo; the CERAM PIG; the
CELEBES PIG; and the BEARDED PIG of Borneo, a species distinguished by a
quantity of long hair carried upon the cheeks. In the Andaman Islands a
small, shaggy wild pig, standing about 20 inches at the shoulder, is found
in the forests. Although distinguished from the well-known wild boar of
India by certain peculiarities, there is a strong family resemblance to
that well-known species in most of these various Asiatic species and races.

Among the many kinds of domesticated swine found in Asia, perhaps the
strangest and most curious is the JAPANESE MASKED PIG. This animal is
described by Darwin as having "an extraordinary appearance, from its short
head, broad forehead and nose, great fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin.
Not only is the face furrowed, but thick folds of skin, which are harder
than the other parts, almost like the plates on the Indian rhinoceros, hang
about the shoulders and rump. It is coloured black, with white feet, and
breeds true. That it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt;
and this might have been inferred even from the circumstance that its young
are not longitudinally striped."

MALE AND FEMALE BABIRUSA.

The chief characteristic of this pig is the peculiar and enormous
development of the tusks in the male, the upper pair of which grow through
the lips and curve backwards.]

In Africa, besides the European wild boar, which there extends its range to
Algeria and Morocco, a little-known wild pig is the SENAAR BOAR, found in
Senaar, Kordofan, and the Soudan region. In the late Dr. Gray's "Catalogue
of Carnivora" this wild pig is described as having the fur dense and
bristly, and being in colour dull olive-black, varied with yellow. Possibly
this little known swine may prove to be merely a sub-species of the common
wild boar of Europe and North Africa. Now that the Soudan regions have once
more been opened up to Europeans, we may expect shortly to hear more of
this wild swine, as well as of other rare and interesting animals.

Still dealing with the true pigs, we come now to the Bush-pigs of Africa
and Madagascar. These differ somewhat from the typical wild boars of Europe
and India in the structure of the teeth, the long pencilled ear-tufts, the
elongated snout, and other characteristics. The tusks are considerably
smaller, and seldom exceed 6 or 7 inches in length. The RED RIVER-HOG, or
WEST AFRICAN BUSH-PIG, is decidedly the most striking of this group.
Smaller than the bush-pig of South Africa, and seldom exceeding 2 feet in
height at the shoulder, the colour of this animal is a brilliant reddish
brown, with tints of yellow. Noticeable streaks of white are found round
the eyes and on the cheeks. The ear-tufts, forehead, and limbs are
blackish; more white markings are seen at the tips of the ear-tufts, along
the thick mane, and round the margins of the ears. The under-parts are
whitish grey in colour. This very handsome pig runs in considerable herds,
and is found chiefly in forest and jungle near the banks of the various
rivers in West Africa. Its range extends from Angola to Senegambia, and
eastwards into the continent as far as Monbuttu.

The well-known BUSH-PIG OF SOUTH AFRICA, the BOSCH-VARK of the Boers, is a
fine species, having a wide range over much of the southern and
south-eastern parts of the continent, extending as far north as Central
Africa. In the Eastern Transvaal and Swaziland these animals attain their
greatest size, an adult boar standing from 2 feet 4 inches to 2 feet 7
inches in height, and weighing as much as from 150 to 170 lbs. The usual
colour is brownish red, the face and mane greyish; but in different
specimens and at different ages great variations are to be noticed. Pale
greyish brown or mottled brown are colours often to be found. These
bush-pigs are formidable-looking creatures, with thick bristling manes,
small deep-set eyes, and sharp if somewhat short tusks, which they know
well how to use. Among the old-fashioned Boers cured hams from these
animals were, when they were more plentiful in Cape Colony, often to be
found in up-country farmhouses. The bosch-vark is a beast of shy, nocturnal
habit, and, loving as it does the shade and protection of dense covert and
bush, is, unless carefully sought for, not often seen by sportsmen. The
herds range usually from half a dozen to as many as twenty in number. When
once encountered and set up at bay, this wild swine will be found a most
tough and courageous adversary, capable and willing to defend itself
stoutly against all foes. "They are," says Mr. F. Vaughan Kirby, who has
had much experience in hunting these animals, "expert swimmers and swift of
foot, and can get over the roughest ground at a great pace. There is no
pluckier beast in Africa than a bush-pig, and even a leopard will hesitate
before attacking a full-grown boar. Like all wild creatures, they have an
instinctive dread of man, and will always make their escape from him if
possible; but if surrounded or wounded and brought to bay, they appear to
accept the situation with stolid imperturbability, and die fighting with
rare pluck, against all odds, grim and silent to the last.... Face to face
in the middle of a 'fast' bush, and only a Swazi 'stabbing-assegai' with
which to kill him, ... I have seen an old boar, after receiving nine
thrusts from those terrible weapons, two of which were still fast in him,
make a charge that scattered us like chaff, and in three consecutive lunges
lame one of our number for life, and disembowel two of the finest
'pig-dogs' I ever hunted with. In such encounters a boar inflicts terrible
wounds with his teeth, as well as with his tusks." Few men care to face a
wart-hog on foot.

Another bush-pig is found in Madagascar, and is known as EDWARDS' BUSH-PIG.
Its habits are very similar to those of its brethren in the neighbouring
continent of Africa.

THE BABIRUSA.

Quitting the true pigs, we come now to perhaps the very strangest and most
singular of all the great tribe of swine. This is the Babirusa, that
curious and grotesque creature found in the island of Celebes, in the Malay
Archipelago. The name Babirusa signifies "pig-deer." It is of course a
misnomer, and the animal has no kinship whatever with the cervine race. The
babirusa is a wild swine, having a dark slate-grey skin, very sparsely
covered with hair along the ridge of the spine. This skin is very
extraordinarily wrinkled. The ears are much smaller than is the case with
other members of the swine group, while the tail is short, straight, and
lacks any semblance of tuft. The females have small tusks. In the boars the
tusks are most singularly and abnormally developed. From the upper jaw,
instead of curving from the side of the lips, the tusks grow from the
centre of the muzzle, penetrate right through the skin, and curve backwards
often till they touch the forehead. The lower tusks have also a strong
curve, but are not so long as those of the upper jaw. Although thus
superabundantly provided with tushes, the babirusa is, as regards the rest
of its teeth, less well off, having only thirty-four, as against the
forty-four of the European wild boar. In their habits these singular pigs
much resemble other wild swine, going in herds and frequenting forest,
jungle, and the banks of rivers. They are excellent swimmers. The young
are, unlike other wild swine in the infant state, unstriped. These animals
are often found domesticated about the dwellings of native chiefs in
Celebes. The weight of a good male is as much as 128 lbs.; height at
shoulder, 27½ inches. The longest tusk recorded measures 17 inches over the
curve. These animals are driven into nets and speared by the natives of
Celebes, and afford excellent sport, the boars especially charging
viciously at their assailants.


THE WART-HOGS.

If the babirusa of the Malay Archipelago is a sufficiently bizarre-looking
creature, the wart-hog of Africa yields to none of the wild pigs in sheer,
downright hideousness of aspect. THE WART-HOG OF SOUTH AFRICA, the
VLAKTE-VARK (Pig of the Plains) of the Boers, has long been familiar to
hunters and naturalists. Standing some 30 inches in height, this wild swine
is distinguished by the disproportionate size of the head, extreme length,
breadth, and flatness of the front of the face and muzzle, smallish ears,
huge tusks, and the strange wart-like protuberances from which it takes its
name. Three of these wen-like growths are found on each side of the face.
The tusks of the upper jaw, unlike the teeth of the true pigs, are much
larger than those protruding from the lower jaw. The lower tusks seldom
exceed 6 inches in length; those of the upper jaw occasionally reach as
much as 20 inches over the curve. A pair from North-east Africa (Annesley
Bay, on the Abyssinian littoral) measure respectively 27 and 26
inches--truly gigantic trophies. The skin of this wild hog is nearly naked,
except upon the neck and back, where a long, coarse main of dark bristly
hair is to be observed. Wart-hogs, as their Dutch name implies, in the days
when game was plentiful, were often found in open country, on the broad
grass-plains and karroos. At the present day they are less often seen in
the open. They run in small family parties, usually two or three sows and
their litters. The old boars, throughout a great part of the year, prefer a
more solitary existence. These animals, when pursued, usually betake
themselves to an open earth, not of their own making, and, slewing round
sharply just as they enter, make their way in hind end first. They afford
no great sport to the hunter, and are usually secured with a rifle-bullet.
The flesh is fairly good eating, especially that of a young and tender
specimen. Speaking generally, wart-hogs are nothing like such fierce and
determined opponents as the wild boars of Europe and India, or even the
bush-pig. They will, however, charge occasionally, and have been known to
attack and rip up a horse. A northern species--ÆLIAN'S WART-HOG--is found
in Abyssinia, Somaliland, and other parts of East Africa, where--especially
in Abyssinia--it roams the mountains and their vicinity, occasionally to a
height of 9,000 or 10,000 feet. There is little difference between this and
the southern form. Wart-hogs produce usually three or four young, and the
sow makes her litter in a disused burrow. Unlike those of the majority of
wild swine, the young of the wart-hog are uniformly coloured, having no
white stripes or spots.

COLLARED PECCARY.

Peccaries are the New World representatives of the Swine, and are
characterised by a large gland on the back.]


THE PECCARIES.

Peculiar to the American Continent, the PECCARIES differ considerably from
the wild swine of the Old World. They are of small size; the dentition is
not the same, the stomach is more complicated in structure, and the hind
feet have three instead of four toes. In general appearance peccaries are
not unlike small dark-coloured pig, well covered with bristles, and having,
as well as a prominent mane, a deep fringe of hair beneath the throat. They
are essentially forest-loving animals, roaming over large tracts of country
and making considerable migrations in search of food. Two species have been
distinctly identified by naturalists--the COLLARED PECCARY, and the
WHITE-LIPPED PECCARY. Of these, the former species is found from Texas, in
North America, as far south as the Rio Negro, in Patagonia. The habitat of
the white-lipped peccary is more circumscribed, and the animal is seldom
found except in that part of South and Central America lying between
British Honduras and Paraguay. No members of the Pig Family are fiercer or
more tenacious of their sanctuaries than the white-lipped peccary, which
roams the dense forests of Brazil and Paraguay in large herds. A human
being, attacked and surrounded by a herd of these savage little creatures,
would indeed stand but a poor chance of his life, and many a hunter and
traveller has been compelled to seek refuge in a tree and sustain some
hours of siege. Of the two species, the white-lipped peccary is somewhat
the larger, standing from 15 to 17½ inches in height. The collared peccary
averages from 13½ to 15½ inches. The flesh of these wild swine is not in
much repute, and unless the back-gland is at once cut out a freshly killed
specimen will become quickly spoiled as a human food-supply. Young
peccaries appear to be easily tamed, fierce as is their nature in the wild
state. In contrast with the abundant litters of other pigs, wild and
domesticated, only one offspring is ordinarily produced at birth. In
fighting, the peccary does not rip like the wild boar, but inflicts savage
and severe bites.

"Untrained dogs," says President Roosevelt, "even those of a large size,
will speedily be killed by a single peccary, and if they venture to attack
a herd will be literally torn into shreds. A big trained dog, however, can,
single-handed, kill a peccary, and I have known the feat performed several
times."

Azara, the eminent Spanish naturalist of the end of the eighteenth century,
had considerable experience of the peccaries of Central and Southern
America, where the Indians are much addicted to taming wild animals, and
keep both the peccary and the tapir in a state of semi-domestication. The
peccary he found to be domesticated more easily than might be expected.
Though so fierce in its wild state, it soon becomes troublesome from its
familiarity.

Mr. Schomburgk, the explorer of Central America, whose travels were so
constantly quoted during the Venezuelan arbitration, saw much of the
white-lipped species in the forests. He found the animals in large troops
under the leadership of an old boar. When attacked, they were ready to
surround man, dog, or jaguar; and if there were no means of escape, the
enemy was certain to be cut to pieces. He himself had a narrow escape from
an infuriated herd, the leader of which he shot in the act of rushing at
him. As the herd approached the sound was like that of a whirlwind through
the bushes.

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.

BY F. C. SELOUS.

Two species of the Hippopotamus Family exist on the earth to-day, both of
which are inhabitants of Africa, and are not found in any other country;
but the remains of many extinct forms of this genus which have been
discovered in various parts of Europe and Asia show that in Pleistocene and
Pliocene times these strange and uncouth animals must have been widely
distributed throughout the greater part of the Old World. The fossil
remains of the large form of hippopotamus which once frequented the lakes
and rivers of England and Western Europe cannot be distinguished from the
bones of the common African species of to-day, which latter is possibly the
only animal in the world which has undergone no change in form or structure
since the prehistoric savages of the Thames Valley threw stone-headed
spears at their enemies.

The COMMON HIPPOPOTAMUS, though it has long been banished from the Lower
Nile, and has more recently been practically exterminated in the British
colonies south of the Limpopo, was once an inhabitant of every lake and
river throughout the entire African Continent from the delta of the Nile to
the neighbourhood of Cape Town. Now it is not found below Khartum, on the
Nile; but in Southern Africa a few hippopotamuses are said still to exist
in the lower reaches of the Orange River. When Van Riebeck first landed at
the Cape, in 1652, he found some of these animals in the swamp now occupied
by Church Square, in the centre of Cape Town, and the last in the district
was only killed in the Berg River, about seventy miles north of that city,
as recently as 1874. This animal, which had been protected for some years,
was at last shot, as it had become very savage, and was in the habit of
attacking any one who approached it. In my own experience I have met with
the hippopotamus in all the large rivers of Africa where I have travelled,
such as the Zambesi, Kafukwe, Chobi, Sabi, Limpopo, and Usutu, and also in
most of the many large streams which take their rise on the plateau of
Matabililand and Mashonaland, and flow north, south, and east into the
Zambesi, the Limpopo, or the Sabi. I have also seen them in the sea, at the
mouth of the Quillimani River, and have heard from natives that they will
travel by sea from the mouth of one river to another.

A THREE-YEAR-OLD HIPPOPOTAMUS.

In this specimen the great lower tusks are not yet developed.]

Hippopotamuses live either in families of a few individuals or in herds
that may number from twenty to thirty members. Old bulls are often met with
alone, and cows when about to calve will sometimes leave their companions
and live for a time in seclusion, returning, however, to the herd soon
after the birth of their calves. Although, owing to the shortness of its
legs, a hippopotamus bull does not stand very high at the shoulder--about 4
feet 8 inches being the average height--yet its body is of enormous bulk. A
male which died some years ago in the Zoological Gardens of London measured
12 feet in length from the nose to the root of the tail, and weighed 4
tons; and these dimensions are probably often exceeded in a wild state.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

HIPPOPOTAMUS DRINKING.

The enormous breadth of the muzzle, as well as the small nostrils, which
can be closed at will, are clearly displayed in this posture.]

The huge mouth of the hippopotamus (see Coloured Plate), which the animal
is fond of opening to its widest extent, is furnished with very large
canine and incisor teeth, which are kept sharp by constantly grinding one
against another, and thus enable their possessor to rapidly cut down great
quantities of the coarse grass and reeds upon which these animals
exclusively feed when living in uninhabited countries. When, however, their
haunts are in the neighbourhood of native villages, they often commit great
havoc in the corn-fields of the inhabitants, trampling down as much as they
eat; and it was their fondness for sugar-cane which brought about the
destruction of the last herd of hippopotamuses surviving in Natal.

The lower canine teeth or tusks of the hippopotamus grow to a great size,
and in bulls may weigh from 4 lbs. to 7 lbs. each. They are curved in
shape, and when extracted from the jaw form a complete half-circle, and
have been known to measure upwards of 30 inches over the curve. In life,
however, not more than a third of their length protrudes beyond the gums.

During the daytime hippopotamuses are seldom met with out of the water.
They lie and doze all day long in the deep pools of the rivers they
frequent, with only their eyes, ears, and nostrils above the surface, or
else bask in the sun on the tail of a sandbank, looking like so many
gigantic pigs with their bodies only partially submerged. Sometimes they
will lie and sleep entirely out of water amongst reeds. I have seen them
feeding in the reed-beds of the great swamps of the Chobi just at sundown,
but as a rule, they do not leave the water until after dark. At night they
often wander far afield, especially in the rainy season, in search of
suitable food; and after having been fired at and frightened, I have known
a herd of hippopotamuses to travel at least five-and-twenty miles along the
course of a river during the ensuing night, in order to reach a larger and
deeper pool than the one in which they had been molested.

[Illustration: _Photo by Lord Delamere_]     [_Northwich._

HIPPOPOTAMUSES BATHING.

A hippopotamus stays under water for about 2½ minutes at a time, and then
just shows part of its head above water while it draws a fresh breath.]

Although the hippopotamus is thoroughly at home in the hottest parts of
Africa, and appears to thrive in the tepid waters of all the rivers which
flow through the malarious coast regions of the tropical portions of that
continent, it is also found at a considerable altitude above the sea, and
in quite small streams where the temperature of the water during the winter
months cannot be many degrees above freezing-point. I have personally met
with hippopotamuses in the Manyami River, not far from the present town of
Salisbury, in Mashonaland. The country there has an altitude of about 5,000
feet above sea-level; and the water was so cold on the last occasion on
which I came across the animals in question--July, 1887--that, if a
basinful was left out during the night, ice quite an eighth of an inch in
thickness would be formed over it before morning. There was, however, never
any ice on the river itself. During the rainy season, when the grass and
reeds are green and succulent, hippopotamuses become enormously fat,
especially in the higher and colder portions of their range, and retain a
good deal of their fat right through the driest season of the year. Old
bulls are usually very lean; but I have seen cows the greater part of whose
carcases, after the skin had been stripped off, was covered with a layer of
fat from 1 inch to 2 inches in thickness. The meat of these animals is dark
red in colour, and more like beef than pork. To my mind, that of a young
animal is most excellent in flavour, and far preferable to that of a lean
antelope. The fat, when prepared, is as good as the best lard, from which,
indeed, it is hardly distinguishable. The skin of the hippopotamus is
smooth and hairless, and in adult animals quite 1½ inch in thickness on the
upper parts of the body.

BABY HIPPOPOTAMUS, AGED SIX MONTHS.

The flesh of a young hippopotamus is said to have an excellent flavour.
Natives often follow shooting expeditions in order to secure some of its
meat.]

Hippopotamuses are said to be capable of remaining under water for ten or
twelve minutes. Should, however, a herd of these animals be watched but not
fired at from the bank of a river in which they are passing the day, they
will all sink below the surface of the water as soon as they become aware
of and more or less alarmed by the presence of the intruder, but each
member of the herd will come up to breathe at intervals of from one to two
minutes. I have seen hippopotamuses so tame and unsuspicious of danger that
they allowed me--the first human being probably with any kind of hat or
clothes on him that they had ever seen--to take up a position within fifty
yards of them on the edge of the deep rock-bound pool in which they were
resting without showing any signs of alarm. They simply stared at me in an
inquisitive sort of way, raising their heads higher out of the water, and
constantly twitching their little rounded ears; and it was not until a
number of natives came up and began to talk loudly that they took alarm,
and, sinking out of sight, retreated to the farther end of the pool. I once
took the length of time with my watch for more than an hour that a
hippopotamus which I was trying to shoot remained under water. This animal,
a cow with a new-born calf, had made an attack upon one of my canoes. It
first came up under the canoe, tilting one end of it into the air and
almost filling it with water. Then it made a rush at the half-swamped
craft, and, laying its huge head over it, pressed it down under the water
and sank it. There were four natives in the canoe at the time of the
attack, all of whom swam safely to an island in the river--the Zambesi.
After the accident--which caused me a good deal of loss and
inconvenience--I tried to shoot this unprovoked aggressor, but
unsuccessfully, as the river was too broad to allow me to get anything but
a long shot at her. The shortest time she remained under water during the
seventy minutes I was paying attention to her was forty seconds, and the
longest four minutes and twenty seconds--the usual time being from two to
two and a half minutes. She always remained a long time under water after
having been fired at.

The capsizing of canoes by these animals is quite a common occurrence on
most African rivers, and the great pains the natives will take in certain
districts to give these animals a wide berth seem to prove that they have
good reason to dread them. Solitary bulls and cows with young calves are
the most feared. Such animals will sometimes, I have been assured by the
natives, tear out the side of a canoe with their teeth, and even crunch up
some of its occupants whilst they are trying to save themselves by
swimming. Sipopo, a chief of the Barotse tribe, who was deposed by his
nephew Mona Wena in 1876, was said to have been attacked and killed by a
hippopotamus whilst lying wounded amongst the reeds on the southern bank of
the Zambesi, but I cannot vouch for the truth of the story.

Bull hippopotamuses must be rather quarrelsome, as I have shot several
whose hides were deeply scored with wounds, no doubt inflicted by the tusks
of their rivals. Once I killed a hippopotamus in a shallow lagoon amongst
the swamps of the Chobi, whose enormously thick hide had been literally cut
to pieces from head to tail. The entire body of this animal was covered
with deep white scores, and we were unable to cut a single sjambok from its
skin. We found, on examination, that this poor beast had been wounded by
natives, and then in its distress most cruelly set upon by its fellows, and
finally expelled from their society. It was in the last stage of
emaciation, and a bullet through the brain must have been a welcome relief.
On another occasion a hippopotamus bull, which I had wounded in the nose,
became so furious that it dived down and attacked one of its fellows which
had already been killed and was lying dead at the bottom of the pool.
Seizing this latter animal by the hind leg, it brought it to the surface of
the water with such a furious rush that not only half the body of the dead
animal it had attacked was exposed, but the whole of its own head and
shoulders came above the water. A bullet through the brain killed it
instantly, and it sank to the bottom of the pool, still holding its
companion's hind leg fast in its jaws.

[Illustration: DENTAL OPERATIONS ON A HIPPOPOTAMUS--NO. I.

This and the next two photographs probably constitute the most remarkable
series of animal photographs ever seen. No 1 shows a hippopotamus about to
be trapped, preparatory to having its teeth attended to.]

When a hippopotamus is killed in the water, the carcase sinks to the
bottom, and in the cold water of the rivers of Mashonaland will not rise to
the surface till six hours after death. In the warmer water of the Lower
Zambesi a dead hippopotamus will come up in about half that time. When it
rises, the carcase comes up like a submerged cork, with a rush as it were,
and then settles down, only a small piece of the side showing above the
surface. As decomposition sets in, it becomes more and more swollen, and
shows higher and higher above the water. When the body of a dead
hippopotamus has been taken by the wind or current to the wrong side of a
river, I have often climbed on to it and paddled it with a stout stick
right across the river to a spot nearer camp. A dead hippopotamus is not
the easiest or the pleasantest thing to sit on in deep water with
crocodiles about, especially in a wind, as it is very much like sitting on
a floating barrel, and unless the balance is exactly maintained one is
bound to roll off.

Although it is often necessary for an African traveller to shoot one or
more of them in order to obtain a supply of meat for his native followers,
there is not much sport attached to the killing of these animals. The
modern small-bore rifles, with their low trajectory and great penetration,
render their destruction very easy when they are encountered in small lakes
or narrow rivers, though in larger sheets of water, where they must be
approached and shot from rickety canoes, it is by no means a simple matter
to kill hippopotamuses, especially after they have grown shy and wary
through persecution. As these animals are almost invariably killed by
Europeans in the daytime, and are therefore encountered in the water, they
are usually shot through the brain as they raise their heads above the
surface to breathe. By the natives hippopotamuses are killed in various
ways. They are sometimes attacked first with harpoons, to which long lines
are attached, with a float at the end to mark the position of the wounded
animal, and then followed up in canoes and finally speared to death.
Sometimes they are caught in huge pitfalls, or killed by the fall of a
spear-head fixed in a heavy block of wood, which is released from its
position when a line, attached to the weight and then pegged across a
hippopotamus's path a few inches above the ground, is suddenly pulled by
the feet of one of these animals striking against it. A friend of mine once
had a horse killed under him by a similar trap set for buffaloes. His
horse's feet struck the line attached to the heavily weighted spear-head,
and down it came, just missing his head and entering his horse's back close
behind the saddle. Where the natives have guns--mostly old muzzle-loading
weapons of large bore--they often shoot hippopotamuses at close quarters
when they are feeding at night. The most destructive native method,
however, of killing these monsters with which I am acquainted is one which
used to be practised by the natives of Northern Mashonaland--namely,
fencing in a herd of these animals and starving them to death. As there is
a very rapid fall in the country through which all the rivers run to the
Zambesi from the northern slope of Mashonaland, these streams consist of a
series of deep, still pools (called "sea-cow holes" by the old hunters),
from a hundred yards to more than a mile in length, connected with one
another by shallow, swift-flowing water, often running in several small
streams over the bed of the river. A herd of hippopotamuses having been
found resting for the day in one of the smaller pools, all the natives in
the district, men, women, and children, would collect and build strong
fences across the shallows at each end. At night large fires would be kept
blazing all round the pool and tom-toms beaten incessantly, in order to
prevent the imprisoned animals from escaping. Day after day the fences
would be strengthened, and platforms sometimes built to command naturally
weak places, and from these points of vantage the poor animals were speared
when in their desperation they tried to leave the pool. Gradually the whole
herd would be speared or starved to death.

A HIPPOPOTAMUS FAMILY--FATHER, MOTHER, AND YOUNG.

Hippopotamuses are very sociable animals, and are often to be met with in
large herds.]

Once, in August, 1880, I came upon a native tribe engaged in starving to
death a herd of hippopotamuses in a pool of the Umniati River, in Northern
Mashonaland. When I came on the scene, there were ten hippopotamuses still
alive in the pool. Eight of these appeared to be standing on a sandbank in
the middle of the river, as more than half their bodies were above the
water. They were all huddled up together, their heads resting on each
other's bodies. Two others were swimming about, each with a heavily shafted
assegai sticking in its back. Besides these ten still living hippopotamuses
two dead ones were being cut up on the side of the pool, and many more must
already have been killed, as all round the pool festoons of meat were
hanging on poles to dry, and a large number of natives had been living for
some time on nothing but hippopotamus-meat. Altogether I imagine that a
herd of at least twenty animals must have been destroyed. Much as one must
regret such a wholesale slaughter, it must be remembered that this great
killing was the work of hungry savages, who at any rate utilised every
scrap of the meat thus obtained, and much of the skin as well, for food;
and such an incident is far less reprehensible--indeed, stands on quite a
different plane as regards moral guilt--to the wanton destruction of a
large number of hippopotamuses in the Umzingwani River, near Bulawayo,
within a few months of the conquest of Matabililand by the Chartered
Company's forces in 1893. These animals had been protected for many years
by Lo Bengula and his father Umziligazi before him; but no sooner were the
Matabili conquered and their country thrown open to white men than certain
unscrupulous persons destroyed all but a very few of these half-tame
animals, for the sake of the few paltry pieces of money their hides were
worth!

[Illustration: _Photo by G. W. Wilson & Co., Ltd._]     [_Aberdeen._

HIPPOPOTAMUS.

The skin of the hippopotamus is often as much as an inch and a half in
thickness on the upper parts of the body.]

Gradually, as the world grows older, more civilised, and, to my thinking,
less and less interesting, the range of the hippopotamus, like that of all
other large animals, must become more and more circumscribed; but now that
all Africa has been parcelled out amongst the white races of Western
Europe, if the indiscriminate killing of hippopotamuses by either white men
or natives can be controlled, and the constant and cruel custom of firing
at the heads of these animals from the decks of river-steamers all over
Africa be put a stop to, I believe that this most interesting mammal, owing
to the nature of its habitat, and the vast extent of the rivers, swamps,
and lakes in which it still exists in considerable numbers, will long
outlive all other pachydermatous animals. Hideous, uncouth, and unnecessary
as the hippopotamus may seem when viewed from behind the bars of its den in
a zoological garden, it is nevertheless true that, when these animals have
been banished from an African river by the progress of civilisation, that
river has lost one of its highest charms and greatest ornaments.

The PYGMY or LIBERIAN HIPPOPOTAMUS is confined to Upper Guinea, and,
compared with its only existing relative, is a very small animal, not
standing more than 2 feet 6 inches in height, and measuring less than 6
feet in length. In weight a full-grown specimen will scale about 400 lbs.
But little is known of the habits of this rare animal, specimens of which,
I believe, have never been obtained, except by the German naturalists Herrn
Büttikofer and Jentink. When alive, the colour of the skin of the pygmy
hippopotamus is said to be of a greenish black, changing on the under-parts
to yellowish green. The surface of the skin is very shiny. This species,
unlike its giant relative, does not congregate in herds, nor pass its days
in rivers or lakes, but lives in pairs in marshes or shady forests. It
sleeps during the day, and at night wanders over a great extent of country,
eating grass, wild fruits, and the young shoots of trees. Its flesh is said
to be very succulent and much esteemed by the natives.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

MALE AND FEMALE HIPPOPOTAMUSES.

A hippopotamus is almost inseparable from the water; it never goes farther
away than possible from a river or lake.]

A hippopotamus, apparently of the same species as that now found in Africa,
formerly inhabited the Thames Valley. Great quantities of fossil remains of
another species are also found in the island of Sicily. The bones found in
England are mainly in the river gravel and brick earth of the south and
midland districts of England. This seems to show that at the time when the
animal existed our rivers must have been open all the year, and not
ice-bound, for it is certain that no hippopotamus could live in a river
which froze in winter. Yet among the remains of these animals are also
found those of quite arctic species like the Musk-ox and the Reindeer,
together with those of the Saiga Antelope, an inhabitant of the cold
plateau of Tibet. The problem is: How could these creatures, one a dweller
in warm rivers and the others inhabitants of cold arctic or sub-arctic
regions, have existed together, apparently on the same area of ground? The
answer, which does not seem to have occurred to naturalists who have
discussed the question, seems to be plain enough. Any one who knows the
conditions of the great rift valleys of Central Africa has the key to the
solution of the puzzle. There was probably a very great difference in the
vertical plane. Deep in the rift was probably a warm river, while above it
may have been mountains from 10,000 to 20,000 feet high, with snow on the
summits and glaciers in their valleys. On these cold and arctic heights the
reindeer and the musk-ox would find congenial homes. Thousands of feet
below, in the hot and narrow valley, the hippopotamus would revel in a warm
and steamy climate. This is what actually occurs in the rift valleys of
Central Africa, where the hippopotamus swims in rivers that are at no great
distance from snow-covered and ice-capped mountains.

CHAPTER XX.

_THE DUGONG, MANATEES, WHALES, PORPOISES, AND DOLPHINS._

BY F. G. AFLALO, F.Z.S.

----

THE DUGONG AND MANATEES.

These curious creatures, which seem to have been the basis of much of the
old mermaid legend, have puzzled many eminent naturalists. Before they were
placed in an order by themselves, Linnæus had classed them with the Walrus,
Cuvier with the Whales, and another French zoologist with the Elephants.
They are popularly regarded as the cows of the sea-pastures. Their habits
justify this. I have often watched dugongs on the Queensland coast browsing
on the long grasses, of which they tear up tussocks with sidelong twists of
the head, coming to the surface to breathe at short intervals.

Omitting the extinct Rhytina, otherwise known as Steller's Sea-cow, which
was exterminated in the Bering Strait not very long after civilised man had
first learnt of its existence, we have to consider two distinct groups, or
genera, of these sirenians. The DUGONG is the representative of the first,
and the two MANATEES belong to the other.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

DUGONG.

A vegetable-feeding sea-mammal from the Indian Ocean and North Australian
waters.]

The dugong is found on the coasts of Northern Australia, in many parts of
the Indian Ocean (particularly off Ceylon), and in the Red Sea. It is
easily distinguished, by even superficial observation, from the manatees.
Its tail is slightly forked, somewhat like that of the whales: the tail of
manatees, on the other hand, is rounded. The dugong's flippers, to which we
also find a superficial resemblance in those of the whale, show no traces
of external nails: in those of the manatees, which show projecting nails,
there is a considerable power of free movement (the hands being, in fact,
used in manipulating the food), which is not the case in the limbs of the
whale. The body of the dugong is almost smooth, though there are bristles
in the region of the mouth: that of the manatees is studded with short
hairs. The male dugong has two large tusks: in neither sex of the manatees
are such tusks developed. Finally, a more detailed examination of the
skeletons would reveal the fact that, whereas the dugong has the usual
seven bones in the neck, that of the manatees has only six.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

AMERICAN MANATEE.

Found in the Amazons River. The Manatees differ remarkably from the Dugong
in the number and structure of their teeth.]

When we come to the Whales, we shall encounter that very characteristic
covering known as "blubber"; and, though it is present in smaller quantity,
these sirenians have blubber as well. Complex stomachs they also have, like
the whales, only in their case both the nature of the food and the
structure of the teeth point clearly to a ruminating habit, which, for
reasons that will be given in the right place, seems inadmissible in the
whales. In both dugong and manatees the mouth is furnished with singular
horny plates, the precise use of which does not appear to have been
satisfactorily determined; and the upper lip of the manatee is cleft in two
hairy pads that work laterally. This enables the animal to draw the grass
into its mouth without using the lower lip at all.

In their mode of life the dugong and manatees differ as widely almost as in
their appearance; for the former is a creature of open coasts, whereas the
manatees hug river-estuaries and even travel many miles up the rivers. Of
both it has been said that they leave the water at night, and the manatees
have even been accused of plundering crops near the banks. The few,
however, which have been under observation in captivity have always been
manifestly uncomfortable whenever, by accident or otherwise, the water of
their tank was run off, so that there is not sufficient reason for
believing this assertion.

This group of animals cannot be regarded as possessing any high commercial
value, though both natives and white men eat their flesh, and the
afore-mentioned rhytina was, in fact, exterminated solely for the sake of
its meat. There is also a limited use for the bones as ivory, and the
leather is employed on a small scale,--a German writer has, in fact, been
at great pains to prove that the Tabernacle, which was 300 cubits long, was
roofed with dugong-skin, and the Red Sea is certainly well within the
animal's range.


THE WHALES, PORPOISES, AND DOLPHINS.

Although anatomists have good reason for suspecting that all the members of
the Whale Tribe are directly descended from river-dwelling forms, if not
indeed, more remotely, from some land animal, there is something
appropriate in the fact of the vast ocean, which covers something like
three-quarters of the earth's surface, producing the mightiest creatures
which have ever lived. There should also be some little satisfaction for
ourselves in the thought that, their fish-like form notwithstanding, these
enormous beings really belong to the highest, or mammalian, class of animal
life.

One striking feature all these many-sized cetaceans have in common, and
that is their similarity of form. Though they may vary in length from 70 to
7 feet, their outline shows a remarkable uniformity. Important internal and
even external differences there may be. A whale may be toothed or
toothless; a dolphin may be beaked or round-headed; either may be with or
without a slight ridge on the back or a distinct dorsal fin; but no
cetacean could well be mistaken for an animal of any other order. It is as
well to appreciate as clearly as possible this close general resemblance
between the largest whale and the smallest dolphin, as the similarity is
one of some interest; and we may estimate it at its proper worth if we bear
in mind that two species of cetaceans, outwardly alike, may not, perhaps,
be more closely allied than such divergent ruminant types as the elephant,
the giraffe, and the gazelle.

NARWHAL.

Reference has already been made to the fact that the whales are true
mammals, and we must now clearly set before us the justification for
separating them from the Fishes--to which any one with a superficial
knowledge of their habits and appearance would unhesitatingly assign
them--and raising them to the company of other mammals. Let us first
separate them from the Fishes. The vast majority of fishes, with some
familiar exceptions like the conger-eel, are covered with scales: whales
have no scales. The tail of fishes, often forked like that of whales, is
set vertically: in whales the tail is set laterally, and for this a good
reason will presently be shown. Fishes have anal fins: whales not only have
no anal fins, but their so-called pectoral fins differ radically from the
fins of fishes. Fishes breathe with the aid of gills: whales have no gills.
Fishes, in the vast majority of cases, reproduce their young by spawning,
the eggs being left to hatch out either in gravel-beds or among the
water-plants, lying on the bottom (as in the case of the herring), or
floating near the surface (as in that of the plaice): whales do not lay
eggs, but bear the young alive. This brings us to the simple points of
resemblance between them and other mammals. When the young whale is born,
it is nourished on its mother's milk. This alone would constitute its claim
to a place among the highest class. Whales breathe atmospheric air by means
of lungs. Hair is peculiarly the covering of mammals, just as scales are
characteristic of fishes and feathers of birds. Many whales, it is true,
have no hair; but others, if only in the embryonic stage, have traces of
this characteristic mammalian covering. It must, moreover, be remembered
that in some other orders of mammals the amount of hair varies
considerably--as, for instance, between the camel and rhinoceros.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

GRAMPUS, OR KILLER.

A carnivorous cetacean with large teeth, often found in British seas.]

Having, then, shown that whales are mammals, we must now determine the
chief features of the more typical members of the order. The extremities of
whales are characteristic: a large head, occupying in some species as much
as one-third of the total length; and the afore-mentioned forked, or lobed,
tail set laterally. The flippers, which bear only a slight resemblance to
the pectoral fins in fishes, are in reality hands encased in
swimming-gloves. In some whales these hands are five-fingered, in others
the fingers number only four, but many of the fingers contain more bones
than the fingers of man. In some whales we find a dorsal fin, and this, as
also the flippers, acts as a balancer. In no whale or porpoise is there any
external trace of hind limbs, but the skeleton of some kinds shows in
varying stages of degradation a rudimentary bone answering to this
description. Perhaps however, the most distinctive feature of whales is the
blow-hole, situated, like the nostrils of the hippopotamus, on the upper
surface of the head, and similarly enabling the animal to breathe the air
without exposing much of its head above the surface of the water. The
blow-hole (or blow-holes, for whalebone-whales have two) may be said to
take the place of nostrils as regards the breathing, though perhaps no
sense of smell is included in its functions. In the Sperm-whale, or
Cachalot, there is a single S-shaped blow-hole near the end of the snout.
The well-known spouting of whales is merely the breathing out of warm
vapour, which, on coming in contact with the colder air--and it should be
remembered that most whaling is carried on in the neighbourhood of
icebergs--condenses in a cloud above the animal's head. I have seen many a
sperm-whale spout, and the cloud of spray, often mixed with a varying
volume of water if the whale commences to blow before its blow-hole is
clear of the surface, drifts forward over the forehead. This is due to the
forward position of the blow-hole. I never to my knowledge saw a
whalebone-whale spouting, but its double jet is said to ascend vertically
over its back, and this would in like manner be accounted for by the more
posterior position of the blow-holes. Having filled its lungs, which are
long and of simple structure, with fresh air, in enormous draughts that
fill the great cavities of its chest, the whale sinks to the depths. There,
in ordinary circumstances, it will lie for a quarter of an hour or more,
but the pain of the harpoon and the knowledge that there is danger at the
surface may keep it below for as much as an hour. When it has to breathe
again, a few powerful strokes from the laterally set tail suffice to bring
it quickly to the surface. This is not the place for a detailed anatomy of
the whale, but no one can fail to notice with admiration such parts of its
equipment for the battle of life as the structure of its windpipe, which
enables it to breathe with comfort with its mouth full of water, the
complicated network of blood-vessels that ensures the slow and thorough
utilising of all the oxygen in its lungs while it remains at the bottom,
and the elastic cushion of blubber that makes this gigantic animal
indifferent to extremes of pressure and temperature. Thanks mainly to its
coat of blubber, the whale exists with equal comfort at the surface or
hundreds of fathoms below it; in the arctic or in tropical seas.

SHORT-BEAKED RIVER-DOLPHIN.

In this type the head is produced into a beak, supported in the upper jaw
by a mass of ivory-like bone.]

It is not perhaps in keeping with the plan of this work that we should
consider in detail the soft parts of the whale's inside. One or two parts
of its feeding and digestive mechanism may, however, offer some points of
passing interest. The complex stomach, which is divided into chambers, like
that of the ruminants already described, has suggested that the latter
function may in a modified process be performed by whales. It is, however,
evident that the teeth of toothed whales are in no way adapted to the act
of mastication, which is inseparable from any conception of ruminating,
while the toothless whales have as complicated a stomach as the rest. Mr.
Beddard, writing on the subject in his interesting "Book of Whales," takes
the more reasonable view that the first chamber of the stomach of whales
should be regarded rather as a storehouse in which the food is crushed and
softened. The teeth of whales, the survival of which in the adult animal
offers the simplest basis of its classification under one or other of the
two existing groups, or sub-orders, are essentially different from the
teeth of many other kinds of mammals. It cannot, perhaps, be insisted that
the distinctive terms employed for these two categories of whales are
wholly satisfactory. For instance, the so-called "toothless" whales have
distinct teeth before birth, thus claiming descent from toothed kinds. On
the other hand, the so-called "toothed" whales are by no means uniformly
equipped in this respect, some of the porpoises having as many as
twenty-six teeth, distributed over both jaws, while the bottlenoses have no
more than two, or at most four, and these in the lower jaw only. Only the
lower jaw, in fact, of the great sperm-whale bears teeth that are of any
use, though there are smaller and functionless teeth in the gums of the
upper. The teeth of whales, by the way, are not differentiated like our
canines and molars, but are all of one character. Although, in "toothless"
whales, the foetal teeth disappear with the coming of the baleen, or
whalebone, the latter must not, in either structure or uses, be thought to
take their place. The plates of whalebone act rather as a hairy strainer.
Unless we seek a possible analogy at the other end of the mammalian scale,
in the Australian duckbill, the feeding of the whalebone-whales is unique.
They gulp in the water, full of _plankton_, swimming open-mouthed through
the streaks of that substance. Then the huge jaws are closed, and the
massive tongue is moved slowly, so as to drive the water from the angles of
the mouth through the straining-plates of baleen, the food remaining
stranded on these and on the tongue. The size and number of the
baleen-plates appear to vary in a degree not yet definitely established;
but there may, in a large whale, be as many as between 300 and 400 on
either side of the cavernous mouth, and they may measure as much as 10 or
12 feet in length and 7 or 8 feet in width.

SOWERBY'S BEAKED WHALE.

One of the rarest of British whales, and very scarce elsewhere. It probably
inhabits the open seas.]

An enumeration of such whales and porpoises and dolphins as have at one
time or other been stranded on the shores of the British Isles may serve as
an epitome of the whole order. Only one interesting group, in fact--the
River-dolphins of the Ganges and Amazons--is unrepresented in the British
list. Whales, either exhausted or dead, are periodically thrown up on our
coasts, even on the less-exposed portions--one of the most recent examples
in the writer's memory being that of a large specimen, over 60 feet long,
stranded on the sands near Boscombe, in Hampshire, and the skeleton of
which at present adorns Boscombe Pier. It was one of the rorquals, or
finbacks, probably of the species called after Rudolphi; but the skeleton
is imperfect, though its owner, Dr. Spencer Simpson, appears to have
preserved some details of its earlier appearance. It should be remembered
that many of the following can only be regarded as "British" with
considerable latitude, the records of their visits being in some cases as
rare as those of the rustic bunting and red-necked nightjar among birds, or
of the derbio and spotted dragonet among fishes.

British zoologists, however, usually include the
following:--WHALEBONE-WHALES: Southern Right-whale; Humpback; Finbacks, or
Rorquals. TOOTHED WHALES: Sperm-whale, or Cachalot; Narwhal; Beluga, or
White Whale; Grampuses; Beaked Whale; Broad-fronted Whale; Cuvier's Whale;
Sowerby's Whale; Pilot-whale; Porpoise; Dolphin; White-sided Dolphin;
White-beaked Dolphin; Bottlenose.

A selection may therefore be made of five of the most representative of
these species--the SOUTHERN WHALE, the CACHALOT, the NARWHAL, the PORPOISE,
and the DOLPHIN.

The SOUTHERN WHALE, which, in common with the closely allied polar species,
whaling-crews call "right," seeing that all other kinds are, from their
point of view, "wrong," is probably the only right-whale which has ever
found its way to our shores. Some writers include the Greenland
Right-whale, but their authority for this is doubtful. It is said to grow
to a length of at any rate 70 feet, though 55 feet would perhaps be more
common for even large specimens. In colour it is said to be dark above,
with a varying amount of white or grey on the flippers and under-surface.
The head and mouth are very large, occupying in some cases one-third of the
total length, and the baleen-plates measure as much as 8 or 10 feet in
length and 5 or 6 feet in width. The species has no back-fin, but there is
a protuberance on the snout, known technically as the "bonnet." This whale
appears to give birth to its single calf some time in the spring months,
and the mother shows great affection for her offspring. The HUMPBACK is
distinguished from the right-whales externally by its longer flippers and
the prominence on its back, and internally by the fluted skin of the
throat. The FINNERS, or RORQUALS, have a distinct back-fin. They feed on
fishes and cuttles, and I have more than once known a rorqual, which looked
fully 50 feet long (comparing it roughly with my 24-foot boat), to swim
slowly round and round my lugger, down on the Cornish coast, puffing and
hissing like a torpedo-boat on its trial trip, rounding up the pilchards in
a mass, and every now and then dashing through them open-mouthed with a
terrific roar, after several of which helpings it would sink out of sight
and not again put in an appearance.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

COMMON PORPOISE.

From 4 to 5 feet long. It lives in "schools," or companies, and pursues the
herrings and mackerel.]

The SPERM-WHALE, or CACHALOT, may serve as our type of the toothed whales.
It attains to the same great dimensions as the largest of the whalebone
group. A more active animal for its size could scarcely be conceived; and I
have seen one, in the Indian Ocean, fling itself three or four times in
succession out of water like a salmon, striking the surface each time as it
fell back with a report like that of a gun. No one appears to have
explained whether performances of this sort are due to mere playfulness,
or, as seems more probable, to the attacks of parasites or such larger
enemies as sharks or "killers." I have also seen four thresher-sharks
leaping out of water, and falling with a loud blow on the whale's back; but
the victim lay quite still in this case, and may in fact have been worn out
before we came upon the scene. I wish to add that I took the word of the
skipper, himself an old whaling-captain, for their identity as threshers.
The dazzling sun shone full on them, and on the sea between, and it was
impossible, even with the ship's telescope, to recognise them with any
accuracy. The cachalot has a very different profile from what any one who
had seen only its skull in a museum would be led to expect, for the
sperm-cavity in the forehead is not indicated in the bones. The structure
of the head enables the animal to drop the lower jaw almost at right angles
to the upper; and Mr. Frank Bullen quotes, in his fascinating "Cruise of
the Cachalot," the current belief that it does so to attract its prey by
the whiteness of its teeth and palate. Although both fishes and cephalopods
are very curious, even to their own destruction, it is doubtful whether the
whale could not catch its food more rapidly by swimming open-mouthed
through the acres of floating squid encountered all over the warmer waters
of the ocean.

ELLIOTT'S DOLPHIN.

One of the commoner Indian species.]

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

RISSO'S DOLPHIN.

About 13 feet in length, found in almost all oceans.]

The NARWHAL, an arctic type, may be distinguished from all other cetaceans
by the single spiral tusk in the left side of the head of the male.
Sometimes the right tusk grows as well, and either may attain a length of
as much as 8 feet; but in the female both teeth remain undeveloped.

The COMMON PORPOISE of our own seas, distinguished by its rounded head from
the equally common beaked dolphin, is too familiar to need much
description. It grows to a length of 5 or 6 feet, and is dark in colour on
the back and white beneath. Its conspicuous back-fin is always recognisable
when it gambols with a herd of its fellows; and a line of these sea-pigs, a
mile or so in length, is no uncommon sight, their presence inshore being
indicative on some parts of the coast of the coming of east wind. The
porpoise, which has, like many of its group, teeth in either jaw, is a
voracious feeder, preying in estuaries on salmon and flounders, and on more
open parts of the coast on pilchards and mackerel. It is occasionally a
serious nuisance in the Mediterranean sardine-fisheries, and I have known
of the fishermen of Collioure, in the Gulf of Lyons, appealing to the
French Government to send a gunboat from Toulon that might steam after the
marauders and frighten them away. One of the most remarkable cases of a
feeding porpoise that I can recall was that of one which played with a
conger-eel in a Cornish harbour as a cat might play with a mouse, blowing
the fish 20 or 30 feet through the air, and swimming after it so rapidly as
to catch it again almost as it touched the water.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHIN.

From 8 to 9 feet long, found from the Mediterranean to the North Sea.]

The DOLPHIN, which is in some seasons as common in the British Channel as
the more familiar porpoise, is distinguished by its small head and long
beak, the lower jaw always carrying more teeth than the upper. It feeds on
pilchards and mackerel, and, like the porpoises, gambols, particularly
after an east wind, with its fellows close inshore. There are many other
marine mammals somewhat loosely bracketed as dolphins. RISSO'S DOLPHIN, for
instance, a rare visitor to our coasts, has a striped skin, and its jaws
are without teeth, which distinguish it from the common dolphin and most of
the others. It cannot therefore feed on fishes, and most probably eats
squid and cuttle-fish. The BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHIN, a species occurring in the
greatest numbers on the Atlantic coast of North America, is regularly
hunted for its oil. HEAVYSIDE'S DOLPHIN, which hails from South African
waters, is a smaller kind, chiefly remarkable for the curious distribution
of black and white on its back and sides.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

HEAVYSIDE'S DOLPHIN.

A small, peculiarly coloured species from the Cape.]

A word must, in conclusion, be said on the economic value of the whales.
Fortunately, as they are getting rarer, substitutes for their once
invaluable products are being from time to time discovered, and much of the
regret at their extermination by wasteful slaughter is sentimental and not
economic. For whalebone it is not probable that a perfect substitute will
ever be found. It therefore maintains a high price, though the former
highest market value of over £2,000 per ton has fallen to something nearer
the half. The sperm-oil from the sperm-whale, and the train-oil from that
of the right-whales, the spermaceti out of the cachalot's forehead and the
ambergris secreted in its stomach, are the other valuable products.
Ambergris is a greyish, fatty secretion, caused by the irritation set up in
the whale's inside by the undigested beaks of cuttle-fish. Its market price
is about £5 per ounce. A lump of 240 lbs. sold for nearly £20,000.

CHAPTER XXI.

_THE SLOTHS, ANT-EATERS, AND ARMADILLOS._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

The very remarkable assemblage of animals we are now about to consider
includes many diverse forms, bracketed together to constitute one great
group; and this on account of the peculiarities of the structure and
distribution of the teeth, which are never present in the front of the jaw,
and may be absent altogether. Of the five groups recognised, three occur in
the New and two in the Old World. All have undergone very considerable
modification of form and structure, and in every case this modification has
tended to render them more perfectly adapted to an arboreal or terrestrial
existence. Flying or aquatic types are wanting. Whilst one great group--the
Sloths--is entirely vegetarian, the others feed either on flesh or insects.


THE SLOTHS.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

NORTHERN TWO-TOED SLOTH (COSTA RICA).

This is also known as Hoffmann's Sloth. The appellation "two-toed" refers
to the fore limb only. The hind foot has three toes.]

In the matter of personal appearance Nature has not been kind to the SLOTH,
though it is certainly true that there are many uglier animals--not
including those, such as some of the Monkey Tribe and certain of the Swine,
which are positively hideous. The mode of life of the sloth is certainly
remarkable, for almost its whole existence is passed among the highest
trees of the densest South American forests, and passed, too, in a
perfectly topsy-turvy manner, inasmuch as it moves from bough to bough with
its legs up in the air and its back towards the ground. It walks and sleeps
suspended beneath the boughs instead of balanced above them, securely
holding itself by means of powerful hooked claws on the fore and hind feet.
This method of locomotion, so remarkable in a mammal, coupled with the
deliberate fashion in which it moves, and the air of sadness expressed in
its quaint physiognomy--large-eyed, snub-nosed, and earless--on which there
seems to dwell an ever-present air of resignation, led the great Buffon to
believe that the sloth was a creature afflicted of God for some hidden
reason man could not fathom! His sympathy was as certainly wasted as his
hasty conclusion was unjustified. There can be no doubt but that the life
led by the sloth is at least as blissful as that of its more lively
neighbours--the spider monkeys, for instance. Walking beneath the boughs
comes as natural to the sloth as walking on the ceiling to the fly.

The sloth sleeps, as we have already remarked, suspended from a bough.
During this time the feet are drawn close together, and the head raised up
and placed between the fore legs, as in the cobego, which we depicted
asleep on page 170, as our readers will remember. In the sleeping position
the sloth bears a striking resemblance to the stump of a lichen-covered
bough, just as the cobego resembles a fruit. Thus is protection from
enemies gained. The resemblance to lichen is further aided by the fact that
the long, coarse hair with which the sloth is clothed becomes encrusted
with a peculiar green alga--a lowly form of vegetable growth--which lodges
in certain grooves or flutings peculiar to the hair of this animal. Such a
method of protection is unique amongst the Mammalia. As the sloths sleep by
day and feed by night, the usefulness of such a method of concealment is
beyond question.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

THREE-TOED SLOTH.

A remarkable peculiarity about the three-toed sloths is the fact that they
have no less than nine vertebræ in the neck, instead of seven, as is usual
among mammals.]

The strange form of locomotion of the sloths renders separate fingers and
toes unnecessary, and so the fingers and toes have come to be enclosed in a
common fold of skin, extending down to the base of the claws.

The sloths stand out in strong contrast to the volatile spider monkeys,
with whom they share the forest; these have added a fifth limb in the shape
of a prehensile tail, by which they may suspend themselves at will. The
sloths, on the contrary, have no tail; they move deliberately, and do not
require it. The monkeys move by prodigious leaps, taken not seldom by
gathering impetus by swinging on their tails.

The great naturalist Bates writes of the sloth: "It is a strange sight to
watch this uncouth creature, fit production of these silent shades, lazily
moving from branch to branch. Every movement betrays, not indolence
exactly, but extreme caution. He never loses his hold from one branch
without first securing himself to the next.... After watching the animal
for about half an hour, I gave him a charge of shot; he fell with a
terrific crash, but caught a bough in his descent with his powerful claws,
and remained suspended. Our Indian lad tried to climb the tree, but was
driven back by swarms of stinging ants; the poor little fellow slid down in
a sad predicament, and plunged headlong into the brook to free himself."

On another occasion the same writer tells us he "saw a sloth swimming
across a river at a place where it was 300 yards broad. I believe it is not
generally known that this animal takes to the water. Our men caught the
beast, cooked and ate him."

In past ages gigantic ground-sloths roamed over South America. The largest
of these, the Megatherium, rivalled the elephant in size. Descendants of
these giants appear to have lingered on till comparatively recent times, as
witness the wonderful discovery by Moreno, made during last year (1900) in
a cave in Patagonia. This was nothing less than a skull and a large piece
of the hide of one of these monsters in a wonderful state of preservation,
showing indeed undoubted traces of blood and sinew. That the hide was
removed by human hands there can be no doubt, for it was _rolled up_ and
turned inside-out. Immediately after this discovery was announced, an
expedition was dispatched from England to hunt, not so much for more
remains, but for the animal itself. Time will show whether these efforts
will prove successful.


THE ANT-EATERS.

Unlike as the ant-eaters are to the sloths, they are nevertheless very
closely related thereto. This unlikeness at the present day is so great
that, were it not for "missing-links" in the shape of fossils, we should
probably never have discovered the relationship. The head of the typical
ant-eaters has been drawn out into a long tubular muzzle, at the end of
which is a tiny mouth just big enough to permit the exit of a long
worm-like tongue, covered with a sticky saliva. This tongue is thrust out
with great rapidity amongst the hosts of ants and termites and their larvæ,
on which they prey. These victims are captured by breaking open their
nests. At once all the active inhabitants swarm up to the breach, and are
instantaneously swept away by the remorseless tongue. The jaws of the
ant-eaters are entirely toothless, and the eyes and ears are very small.

The largest species of ant-eater is about 4 feet long. It lives entirely
upon the ground. Generally speaking, it is a harmless creature; but at
times, when cornered, it will fight furiously, sitting up on its hind legs
and hugging its foe in its powerful arms. Bates, the traveller-naturalist,
relates an instance in which a dog used in hunting the GREAT ANT-EATER was
caught in its grip and killed. The tail of this large species is covered
with very long hair, forming an immense brush. The claw on the third toe of
each fore limb is of great size, and used for breaking open ants' and other
insects' nests.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

THE GREAT ANT-EATER.

In walking the ant-eater turns its toes inwards, so that the claws turn
upwards and inwards, the weight of the body being borne by a horny pad on
the fifth toe, and the balls of the third and fourth toes.]

But besides the great ground ant-eater there are some tree-haunting
species. These have a shorter muzzle, and short hair on the tail, which is
used, as with the spider monkeys, as a fifth limb. Curled round the bough
of a tree, its owner is free to swing himself out on to another branch.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

TAMANDUA ANT-EATER.

This species, which is a smaller animal than the Great Ant-eater, lives
almost entirely in the trees, instead of on the ground.]

The smallest of the tree-dwelling species is not larger than a rat, and is
a native of the hottest parts of the forests of South and Central America.
The muzzle in this species is quite short, not long and tubular, as in the
larger species. It is a very rare animal, or is at least very seldom seen,
a fact perhaps due to its small size. It is known as the TWO-TOED
ANT-EATER, only the second and third fingers of the fore feet bearing
claws.

Von Sack, in his "Narrative of a Voyage to Surinam," tells us that the
natives of Surinam call this little animal "Kissing-hand"--"as the
inhabitants pretend that it will never eat, at least when caught, but that
it only licks its paws, in the same manner as the bear; that all trials to
make it eat have proved in vain, and that it soon dies in confinement. When
I got the first, I sent to the forest for a nest of ants; and during the
interim I put into its cage some eggs, honey, milk, and meat; but it
refused to touch any of them. At last the ants' nest arrived, but the
animal did not pay the slightest attention to it either. By the shape of
its fore paws, which resemble nippers, I thought that this little creature
might perhaps live on the nymphæ of wasps, etc. I therefore brought it a
wasps' nest, and then it pulled out with its nippers the nymphæ from the
nest, and began to eat them with the greatest eagerness, sitting in the
posture of a squirrel. I showed this phenomenon to many of the inhabitants,
who all assured me that it was the first time they had ever known that
species of animal take any nourishment."


THE ARMADILLOS.

Readers of this book will doubtless have noticed long ere this how manifold
are the devices for the purpose of defence adopted by the Mammalia. The
ARMADILLOS have certainly selected the most complete, having encased
themselves in an impenetrable bony armour as perfect as the coat of mail of
the warrior of the Middle Ages. Concerning this and the variations thereon
adopted by the different members of the group we shall speak presently.

Armadillos are mostly confined to South America, and occur both in the open
pampas and the shady depths of the forest. They live in burrows, which they
dig with incredible speed. These burrows are generally found in the
vicinity of the nests of ants and termites, which form their staple diet.
One species, however, at least feeds apparently with equal relish upon
vegetable matter, eggs, young birds, mice, snakes, and carrion.

The bony armour is disposed over the crown of the head, back, and flanks.
It is made up of numerous small, bony plates, buried deep in the skin, and
each overlaid by a horny scale. The tail is protected by bony rings. The
plates covering the shoulders and those directly over the hindquarters fuse
into a solid mass, thus forming chambers into which the limbs can be
withdrawn. In the region of the body, between these two shields, the plates
are arranged in rows encircling the body, thus permitting the animal to
roll itself up as occasion may require. Hairs grow out between the plates,
and in some cases give the animal quite a furry appearance.

TWO-TOED ANT-EATER.

Although the fore feet have four toes, only the second and third bear
claws; hence the name "Two-toed" Ant-eater.]

Speaking of the burrowing powers of the armadillo, Darwin, in his most
fascinating "Voyage of the Beagle," tells us that "the instant one was
perceived, it was necessary, in order to catch it, almost to tumble off
one's horse; for in soft soil the animal burrowed so quickly that its
hinder quarters would almost disappear before one could alight. It seems
almost a pity to kill such nice little animals; for as a Gaucho said, while
sharpening his knife on the back of one, 'Son tan mansos' (They are so
quiet)." As a rule, armadillos are regarded as animals loving dry, sandy
wastes; nevertheless, they are said to be able to swim both well and
swiftly. The flesh of the armadillo is apparently by no means unpalatable.


THE PICHICIAGO.

One of the most remarkable of the armadillos is the PICHICIAGO, or FAIRY
ARMADILLO. It is a tiny creature of some 5 inches long, found in the sandy
wastes of the western part of the Argentine Republic. The horny covering of
the bony plates is pinkish colour, and the hair is silky in texture and
snow-white. But it is not on this account that the fairy armadillo is
remarkable: its claim to notoriety rests on the peculiar arrangement of the
bony plates constituting the armour. These bony plates are small and thin,
and covered, as in other species, with a horny coat; but instead of being
embedded in the skin, they are attached only along the middle of the back,
and project freely over the body on either side, leaving a space between
the shield and the body. The hinder end of the body is specially protected
by a nearly circular vertical shield, firmly fixed to the hip-girdle. This
shield, it is said, is used as a plug to fill up its burrow with.


THE PELUDO.

Armadillos of the normal type, wherein the body armour is embedded in the
skin, are represented by numerous species. Of one, known as the PELUDO, Mr.
Hudson has given us some interesting details. "It feeds," he tells us, "not
only upon insects, but also upon vegetable matter, eggs, young birds, and
carrion. Its method of capturing mice was certainly ingenious. It hunted by
smell, and when nearing its prey became greatly agitated. The exact spot
discovered, the body was raised slowly to a sitting posture, and then flung
suddenly forwards, so that the mouse or nest of mice was imprisoned
beneath, and promptly dispatched." "Still more remarkable," says Mr.
Lydekker, "is the manner in which a peludo has been observed to kill a
snake, by rushing upon it and proceeding to saw the unfortunate reptile in
pieces by pressing upon it closely with the jagged edges of its armour, and
at the same time moving its body backwards and forwards. The struggles of
the snake were all in vain, as its fangs could make no impression upon the
panoply of its assailant, and eventually the reptile slowly dropped and
died, to be soon afterwards devoured by the armadillo, which commenced the
meal by seizing the snake's tail in its mouth, and gradually eating
forwards."

bony armour in which they are encased.]

HAIRY-RUMPED ARMADILLO.

This species, like the Peba Armadillo, varies its diet with carrion.]


THE PANGOLINS.

The PANGOLINS, or SCALY ANT-EATERS, are perhaps even more curious creatures
than the armadillos. They have been likened in appearance to animated
spruce fir-cones, to which indeed they bear a strange resemblance. This
resemblance is due to the wonderful armature of the skin, which takes the
form of large overlapping, pointed, horny plates or scales. The pangolins
are confined to the Old World, occurring in South Africa and South-eastern
Asia. Like the American Ant-eaters, teeth are wanting, and the tongue is
long and worm-like, being employed in the capture of insects, as in the New
World ant-eaters.

The scales of the MANIS are formed by the fusion together of fine hairs.
Like the spines of the hedgehog and porcupine, they serve the purpose of
offensive defence; for when the manis rolls itself up, these pointed scales
project at right angles to the body, and offer a formidable resistance to
any enemy whatsoever. They also serve to break the force of a fall, which,
indeed, is often voluntary; for should the animal wish to descend from the
branch of a tree, it will often take a short cut to the ground by
deliberately dropping, the force of the fall being entirely broken by the
elastic scales.

In climbing, the tail is of the greatest service, its under-surface being
clothed with pointed scales, which serve as so many climbing-hooks. The
grasp of a tree-trunk gained by the hind legs and tail is so secure that
the body can be moved to a horizontal position with ease. In a specimen
kept in captivity by Mr. Fraser, this horizontal movement was a form of
exercise which appeared to afford the greatest pleasure.

THE AARD-VARK.

The custom of naming newly discovered animals after well-known forms to
which they are supposed to bear some resemblance, physically or otherwise,
is a common one. The animal now under consideration shows this once more,
having originally received the name of AARD-VARK (Earth-pig) from the Boers
of the Cape. The aard-vark is a most decidedly ugly animal, and justifies
its name in several particulars. It is hunted for the sake of its hide,
which is of great thickness and resembles that of the pig, but is sparsely
covered with hairs, the general shape of its body being not unlike that of
a long-headed, short-legged, heavy-tailed pig. The whole animal is about 6
feet long. In a wild state, or even in captivity, it is but rarely seen,
since it is a night-feeder, and passes the day in sleep deep down in a
burrow. This burrow it digs for itself with the aid of powerful claws borne
on the fore feet. It lives principally on ants and termites, breaking down
their nests, and remorselessly sweeping up the frightened occupants with a
long, sticky tongue, as soon as they rush to the seat of the disturbance
which has broken up the harmony and order of their community. At one time
it was believed that the aard-vark was a close ally of the pangolin, but
later researches have disproved this, and have furthermore thrown doubt
upon the probability of its relationship with any of the members of this
group of mammals at all.

There are two species of this animal--the CAPE AARD-VARK of South and
South-east Africa, and the ETHIOPIAN AARD-VARK of North-east Africa.

[Illustration: _By permission of the Hon. Walter Rothschild_]     [_Tring._

CAPE AARD-VARK.

The ants upon which the aard-vark largely subsists appear to be very
fattening, and impart a delicate flavour to the flesh, especially to the
hams, which are greatly esteemed.]

Where the nest-building ants are most common, there will the aard-vark--or
Innagus, as the Boers sometimes call it--be most plentiful. The nests of
these ants are huge structures of from 3 to 7 feet high, and often occupy
vast areas of ground, extending as far as the eye can reach. They are
substantially built, and swarm with occupants, and consequently are quite
worth raiding. But the aard-vark has become much less common since a price
has been set upon its skin. The powers of digging of these animals are so
great that they can completely bury their large bodies in a few minutes,
even when the ground has been baked by the sun into something like
adamantine hardness. In excavating their burrows, the ground is thrown out
by the fore feet, in huge lumps, through or rather between the hind legs.
Shy and suspicious, the least unusual sound will send them scuttling to
earth, for their sense of hearing is very keen. They seem to change their
minds somewhat frequently, when engaged in digging out a new burrow; for
half-excavated burrows in the side of ant-hills are very commonly met with.
A fully grown aard-vark is about 6 feet long--generally rather more.
Although this animal is frequently kept in captivity, it is but rarely seen
by visitors, owing to its nocturnal habits, of which we have already
spoken.

The teeth of the aard-vark are sufficiently remarkable to justify notice
here. Only the crushing teeth are represented--that is to say, the front or
cutting teeth are conspicuous by their absence. These crushing teeth number
from eight to ten in the upper and eight in the lower jaw, on each side;
but in the adult fewer would be found, the number being reduced to five in
each side of the jaws--that is to say, there are but twenty all told. In
structure these teeth are quite remarkable, differing entirely from those
of all other mammals, and resembling those of some fishes; furthermore,
they have no "roots," but instead grow continually throughout life, which
"rooted" teeth do not.

CHAPTER XXII.

_MARSUPIALS AND MONOTREMES._

BY W. SAVILLE-KENT, F.L.S., F.Z.S.

----

MARSUPIALS.

With the order of the Pouched Mammals we arrive--with the exception of the
Echidna and Platypus, next described--at the most simply organised
representatives of the Mammalian Class. In the two forms above named,
egg-production, after the manner of birds and reptiles, constitutes the
only method of propagation. Although among marsupials so rudimentary a
method of reproduction is not met with, the young are brought into the
world in a far more embryonic condition than occurs among any of the
mammalian groups previously enumerated. There is, as a matter of fact, an
entire absence of that vascular or blood connection betwixt the parent and
young previous to birth, known as placentation, common to all the higher
mammals, though certain of the more generalised forms have been recently
found to possess a rudiment of such development. In correlation with their
abnormally premature birth, it may be observed that a special provision
commonly exists for the early nurture of the infant marsupials. In such a
form as the Kangaroo, for example, the young one is placed, through the
instrumentality of its parent's lips, in contact with the food-supplying
teat, and to which for some considerable period it then becomes inseparably
attached. Special muscles exist in connection with the parent's mammary
glands for controlling the supply of milk to the young animal, while the
respiratory organs of the little creature are temporarily modified in order
to ensure unimpeded respiration. The fact of the young in their early life
being commonly found thus inseparably adhering to the parent's nipple has
given rise to the falacious but still very widely prevalent idea among the
Australian settlers that the embryo marsupial is ushered into the world as
a direct outgrowth from the mammary region.

[Illustration: _Photo by Billington_]     [_Queensland._

SILVER-GREY KANGAROO.

In general form the kangaroos are so like one another that one figure would
almost serve for all.]

At the present day, with the exception of the small group of the American
Opossums and the Selvas, the entire assemblage of marsupials, comprising
some 36 genera and 150 species, are, singularly to relate, exclusively
found in Australia, New Guinea, and the few neighbouring islands recognised
by systematic zoologists as pertaining to the Australasian region. What is
more, this region of Australasia produces, with some few insignificant
exceptions, chiefly rodents, no other indigenous mammals.

BENNETT'S WALLABY AND THE GREAT GREY KANGAROO.

This photograph illustrates the relative sizes of these two species.]

It is interesting to note that within the limits of this isolated and
anciently founded marsupial order we have an epitome, as it were, of many
of the more important groups of an equivalent classificatory value that are
included among the higher mammalia previously described. In this
relationship we find in the so-called Tasmanian Wolf, the Tasmanian Devil,
and the "Native Cats" carnivorous and eminently predatory forms whose
habits and general conformation are immediately comparable to those of the
typical Carnivora. The Bandicoots, Banded Ant-eater, and Phascogales recall
in a similar manner the higher Insectivora. In the tree-frequenting
Opossums and Phalangers the external likeness and conformity in habits to
the arboreal rodents is notably apparent, several of the species, moreover,
possessing a parachute-like flying-membrane essentially identical with that
which is found in the typical Flying-squirrels. An example in which the
ground-frequenting or burrowing rodents are closely approached is furnished
by the Australian Wombat, an animal which may be appropriately likened to
an overgrown and lethargic Marmot. In this form, moreover, the rodent-like
character of the dentition is especially noteworthy. The higher
grass-eating mammals find their counterparts in the family group of the
Kangaroos, in which, in addition to their essentially herbivorous habits,
the contour of the head and neck, together with the expressive eyes and
large expanding ears, are wonderfully suggestive of the various members of
the Deer Family. The Cuscuses of New Guinea and the adjacent islands, both
in form and habits, somewhat resemble their geographical neighbours, the
Lorises, belonging to the Lemur Tribe, compared with which higher mammals,
however, they possess the advantage of an eminently serviceable prehensile
tail. The Australian Koala, or so-called "Native Bear," has been commonly
compared by zoologists with the Edentate Sloths; while in the most recently
discovered marsupial, the Pouched Mole, we have a counterpart, in both form
and habits, of the familiar European species. Finally, in the small
American section of the Marsupialia, we meet with a type--the so-called
Yapock, or Water-opossum--in which the resemblances to an Otter, in both
aspect and its aquatic habits, are so marked that the animal was originally
regarded as a species only of the Otter Tribe.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

ALBINO RED KANGAROOS.

Albino kangaroos and other Australian animals have been observed to be the
product of special, narrowly limited locations.]

The character of the _marsupium_, or pouch, differs materially among the
various members of their order. It presents its most conspicuous and normal
development in such animals as the Kangaroos, Wallabies, and the Australian
Opossums or Phalangers. In the Tasmanian Wolf and the Bandicoots the pouch
opens backwards. In such forms as the Phascogale, or Pouched Mouse, the
pouch is reduced to a few rudimentary skin-folds, while in the Banded
Ant-eater its position is occupied by a mere patch of longer hairs, to
which the helpless young ones cling. On the same _lucus a non lucendo_
principle there is no trace of a pouch in the Koala, nor in those smaller
species of the American Opossums which habitually carry their young upon
their back. Even in these pouchless marsupials, however, the peculiar
marsupial bones are invariably present, and in all other essential details
their accord with the marsupial type of organisation and development is
fully maintained.


THE KANGAROOS.

The typical and most familiar member of the Marsupial Order is the
KANGAROO--the heraldic mammal of that vast island-continent in the South
Seas, whose phenomenal advance by leaps and bounds, from what scarcely a
century since was represented by but a few isolated settlements, has been
aptly likened to the characteristic progression of this animal. Of
kangaroos proper there are some twenty-four known species distributed
throughout the length and breadth of Australia, extending southwards to
Tasmania, and to the north as far as New Guinea and a few other adjacent
islands.

In point of size the GREAT GREY KANGAROO and the RED or WOOLLY species run
each other very closely. A full-grown male of either species will weigh as
much as 200 lbs., and measure a little over 5 feet from the tip of the nose
to the base of the tail, this latter important member monopolising another
4 or 4½ feet. The red or woolly species more especially affects the rocky
districts of South and East Australia, while the great grey kind is
essentially a plain-dweller and widely distributed throughout the grassy
plains of the entire Australian Continent and also Tasmania. It is to the
big males of this species that the titles of "Boomer," "Forester," and "Old
Man Kangaroos" are commonly applied by the settlers, and the species with
which the popular and exciting sport of a kangaroo hunt--the Antipodean
substitute for fox-hunting--is associated. The pace and staying power of an
old man kangaroo are something phenomenal. Our home country fox-hounds
would have no chance with it; consequently a breed of rough-haired
greyhounds, known as kangaroo-dogs, are specially trained for this sport. A
run of eighteen miles, with a swim of two in the sea at the finish, and all
within the space of two brief crowded hours, is one of the interesting
records chronicled. The quarry, when brought to bay, is, moreover, a by no
means despicable foe. Erect on its haunches, with its back against a tree,
the dogs approach it at their peril, as, with a stroke of its powerful
spur-armed hind foot, it will with facility disembowel or otherwise fatally
maim its assailant. Another favourite refuge of the hunted "boomer" is a
shallow water-hole, wherein, wading waist-deep, it calmly awaits its
pursuers' onslaught. On the dogs swimming out to the attack, it will seize
them with its hand-like fore paws, thrust them under water, and, if their
rescue is not speedily effected, literally drown them. Even man, without
the aid of firearms, is liable to be worsted in an encounter under these
conditions, as is evidenced in the following anecdote.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

TASMANIAN WALLABY.

Has softer and thicker fur than its relative of the Australian mainland.]

A newly arrived settler from the old country, or more precisely from the
sister island, ignorant of the strength and prowess of the wily marsupial,
essayed his maiden kangaroo hunt with only a single dog as company. A fine
grey boomer was in due course started, and after an exciting chase was
cornered in a water-hole. The dog, rushing after it, was promptly seized
and ducked; and Pat, irate at the threatened drowning of his companion,
fired, but missed his quarry, and thereupon jumped into the water-hole,
with the intention, as he afterwards avowed, "to bate the brains out of the
baste" with the butt-end of his gun. The kangaroo, however, very soon
turned the tables upon Pat. Before he had time to realise the seriousness
of the situation he found himself lifted off his feet, and soused and
hustled with such vigour that both Pat and his dog most narrowly escaped a
watery grave. A couple of neighbours, by good luck passing that way,
observed the turmoil, and came to the rescue. Between them they beat off
and killed the kangaroo, and dragged Pat to land in a half-drowned and
almost insensible condition. Pat recovered, and vowed "niver to meddle with
such big bastes" again.

The doe kangaroos, while of smaller size and possessing much less staying
power than their mates, can nevertheless afford a good run for horses and
dogs, and are commonly known as "flyers." When carrying a youngster, or
"Joey," in her pouch, and hard pressed by the dogs, it is a common thing
for the parent to abstract her offspring from the pouch with her fore paws,
and to throw it aside into the bush. The instinct of self-preservation
only, by the discharge of hampering impedimenta, is usually ascribed to
this act; but it is an open question whether the maternal one of securing a
chance of escape for her young, while feeling powerless to accomplish it
for herself, does not more often represent the actual condition of the
case.

In proportion to the size of its body the kangaroo yields but a limited
amount of meat that is esteemed for food. The tail represents the most
highly appreciated portion, since from it can be compounded a soup not only
equal to ordinary ox-tail, but by gourmands considered so superior that its
conservation and export have proved a successful trade enterprise. The
loins also are much esteemed for the table, but the hind limbs are hard and
coarse, and only appreciated by the native when rations are abnormally
short. "Steamer," composed of kangaroo-flesh mixed with slices of ham,
represented a standing and very popular dish with the earlier Australian
settlers; but with the rapid disappearance of the animal before the advance
of colonisation this one time common concoction possesses at the present
day a greater traditional than actual reputation.

The hunting of the kangaroo is conducted on several distinct lines, the
method of its pursuit being varied, according to whether the animal is
required for the primary object of food, for the commercial value of its
skin, as a matter of pure sport, or to accomplish its wholesale destruction
in consequence of its encroachments on the pasturage required for sheep-
and cattle-grazing.

ROCK-WALLABY.

The Rock-Wallabies, in contradistinction to the Kangaroos, are for the most
part nocturnal in their habits.]

The greatest measure of healthy excitement in hunting the kangaroo, from
the standpoint of pure sport, is no doubt to be obtained when running the
marsupial down with horse and hounds in congenial company, as referred to
on a previous page. The stalking of the animal single-handed on horseback
or on foot, much after the manner of the deer, has also its enthusiastic
votaries, and calls into play the greatest amount of patience and
_savoir-faire_ on the part of the sportsman. It has been affirmed by a
Queensland writer, "To kill kangaroos with a stalking-horse requires the
practice of a lifetime, and few 'new chums' have the patience to learn it.
It is, in fact, only stockmen, black-fellows, and natives of the bush who
can by this method expect to make kangaroo-shooting pay." The horse which
is successfully employed by experienced bushmen for stalking purposes is
specially trained to its work, and, walking apparently unconcernedly in the
direction of the selected quarry, brings the gunners, if they are experts
in the art of keeping themselves well concealed, within easy range. In this
manner two or three kangaroos are not infrequently shot in the same stalk,
the animals having a tendency, on hearing the report of the gun, but not
locating the direction from which it was discharged, to rush about in an
aimless manner, and, as frequently happens, in the immediate direction of
the hidden sportsman. In the good old times it is recorded that an
experienced hand might kill as many as seventy or eighty kangaroos in a day
by this stalking method. The marsupials are at the present date, however,
so severely decimated that even in the most favourable settled districts a
bag of from twelve to twenty head must be regarded as exceptional. Stalking
the kangaroo on foot without the horse's aid is more strongly recommended
to those to whom an occasional shot is considered sufficiently
remunerative. Taking full advantage of intervening bushes and other
indigenous cover, an approach to within a hundred yards or so of the quarry
may be usually accomplished, though not quite so easily, perhaps, as might
be at first anticipated. It is the habit of the kangaroo to sit up
waist-high in the midst of the sun-bleached grass, which corresponds so
closely in colour with its own hide that unless the animal is silhouetted
against the sky-line it readily escapes detection.

The conditions under which the kangaroo is obtained for the main purpose of
supplying the human commissariat is perhaps most aptly illustrated in
connection with its chase as prosecuted by the Australian aborigines. In
Tasmania and the Southern Australian States the primeval man is either
extinct or more rare than the kangaroo. In the extreme north and far
north-west, however, he still poses as "the lord of creation," and conducts
his hunting expeditions on a lordly scale. The food-supply of the
Australian native is essentially precarious. Long intervals of "short
commons" are interspersed with brief periods of over-abundance, in which he
indulges his appetite to its fullest bent. A kangaroo drive on native lines
represents to the Australian mind one of these last-named superlatively
memorable occasions. The entire tribe, men, women, and all capable youths,
participate in the sport. Fires are lit by one section of the tribe,
according to the direction of the wind, encircling a vast area of the
country, while the other section posts itself in detachments in
advantageous positions to intercept the terrified marsupials as they fly in
the presumed direction of safety to escape the devouring element. Spears
and waddies and boomerangs, in the hands of the expert natives, speedily
accomplish a scene of carnage, and the after feast that follows may perhaps
be best left to the imagination of the reader. The encroachments of
neighbouring natives on the happy hunting-grounds that time and custom have
conceded to be the sole monopoly of any one particular tribe is most
strenuously resented, and constitute one of the commonest sources of their
well-nigh perpetual inter-tribal battles.

A kangaroo battue, as carried into practice by European settlers in those
few remaining districts where the animal is sufficiently abundant to
constitute a pest by its wholesale consumption of the much-prized
pasturage, is far more deadly in its results to the unfortunate marsupials.
Existing sheep-fences, supplemented by a large suitably enclosed yard, are
first specially prepared for the reception of the expected victims. All the
settlers, stockmen, and farm hands from the country round are pressed into
service, and assemble on horseback or on foot at the appointed rendezvous
at break of day. A widely spreading cordon of beaters being told off, a
systematic drive is then commenced, which results in all the animals being
driven towards and collected within the enclosed yard. The culminating
scene is one of wholesale slaughter with club and gun. From these battues
none of the unfortunate animals escape, as they are so closely hemmed in.

The first record of the existence of the kangaroo, coupled with its
characteristic name, is found associated, it is interesting to observe,
with the history of one of the earlier voyages of Captain Cook. The
neighbourhood of Cooktown, in Queensland, claims the honour of supplying
the first example of the animal which was brought to Europe and astonished
the zoologists of that time by the singularity of its form and reported
habits. Captain Cook happened--in July, 1770--to be laying up his ship, the
_Endeavour_, for repairs, after narrowly escaping total wreck on the
neighbouring Great Barrier Reef, in the estuary of the river subsequently
coupled with his ship's name. Foraging parties, dispatched with the object
of securing, if possible, fresh meat or game for the replenishment of the
ship's well-nigh exhausted larder, returned with reports of a strange
creature, of which they subsequently secured specimens. Skins were
preserved and brought to England, but it was some little time before the
zoological position and affinities of the creature were correctly
allocated. By some naturalists it was regarded as representing a huge
species of Jerboa, its near relationship to the previously known American
Opossums being, however, eventually substantiated. The closer
acquaintanceship with the peculiar fauna of Australia that followed upon
Captain Cook's memorable voyage of discovery along the coast-line of that
island-continent soon familiarised naturalists with many other of the
allied species of which the kangaroo constitutes the leading
representative.

Some considerable amount of obscurity is associated with the prime origin
of the animal's almost world-wide title of "Kangaroo." It is most commonly
accepted as representing the native name for the creature in that
Queensland district from whence it was first reported by Captain Cook. No
later investigations and enquiries have, however, in any way established
the correctness of this hypothesis, those explorers who have made a special
study of the dialects and habits of the aboriginal inhabitants entirely
failing to elicit anything even remotely coinciding with the name in
question. It has, in fact, been reluctantly concluded by one of the most
experienced Queensland authorities on these matters that the name
originated as a mere miscomprehension of the information elicited from the
natives. Verbal communication with the native tribes under the most
favourable circumstances is liable to a vast amount of misunderstanding,
and where other than linguistic experts are present it frequently happens
that much mongrel or "pidgin English" gets mixed up with the native terms.
Assuming this to have been the case in the present instance, it has been
suggested that the name of Kangaroo, or "Kanguroo," as it was originally
spelt, implied some form of negation of the knowledge which the enquiring
white man was seeking to elicit, or, maybe, partly even a phonetic and
parrot-like repetition of the constantly recurring query that was doubtless
current among the "handy men" of the _Endeavour's_ commission, such as "Can
you" tell me this or that concerning the many unfamiliar objects that
greeted the eyes of the new arrivals in this strange land. The writer
retains a vivid recollection of a closely analogous manner in which the
rural inhabitants of Vigo Bay, on the Spanish coast, appropriated a common
phrase used by the crew of the yacht with whom he landed there. Having
evidently noted that the two words "I say" prefaced the majority of
Jack-tar's speeches, this catch-phrase was adopted and applied by them as a
greeting and as a reply to almost every interrogation in dumb-show or
otherwise that was addressed to them. An unknown animal submitted to these
rustic Solons would doubtless have been dubbed the "I say"; and had the
land been a new one--say, somewhere in the South Seas--that name would
probably have stuck to it. Applying this interpretation to the kangaroo,
and bearing in mind the fondness of the Australian native to duplicate his
name-words or syllables--e.g. _wagga-wagga_, _debil-debil_, and so
forth--the "Kang-you-you" or a closely resembling phonetic expression would
present itself to the native mind as a much more correct rendering of the
simpler "Can you" or "Kang you" which he had picked up as a catch-phrase
from the _Endeavour's_ crew. In the absence, at all events, of any more
rational interpretation of the mystery, this one would seem to merit
consideration.

While the kangaroo is being speedily dethroned from the dominant position
it originally occupied in the indigenous Australian fauna, praiseworthy and
highly successful attempts have been made to acclimatise this marsupial on
British soil. At Tring Park, Lord Rothschild's estate, Woburn Abbey, and
elsewhere, troops of these graceful creatures may be seen under conditions
of happiness and liberty scarcely inferior to those by which they are
environed in their native "bush."

THE GREAT KANGAROO LEAPING.

In the posture in which this animal is represented the extraordinary size
and strength of the hind limbs and tail are displayed to the best
advantage. Both features are connected with the animal's marvellous powers
of leaping.]

Of smaller members of the Kangaroo Family, there are some thirty distinct
forms, popularly known in Australia as WALLABIES, WALLAROOS, PADDY-MELONS,
POTOROOS, KANGAROO-HARES, KANGAROO-RATS, etc. The wallabies, which
represent the most important group with regard to their larger size and
economic utility, number some fourteen or fifteen species, and are
distinguished, with relation more especially to their habitats or peculiar
structure, as ROCK-, BRUSH-TAIL, and SPUR-TAIL WALLABIES, etc. Among the
rock-wallabies the yellow-footed species from South Australia is
undoubtedly one of the handsomest as well as the largest member of its
group, the uniform grey characteristic of the majority of its members being
in this instance represented by an elegantly striped and banded form, in
which the several tints of brown, yellow, black, and white are pleasingly
interblended. A very fine example of this wallaby was included in the
valuable collection of animals, formerly at Windsor, recently presented to
the Zoological Society by His Majesty King Edward, and is now on view at
the Regent's Park. The successful stalking of rock-wallabies in their
native fastnesses entails no mean amount of patience and agility. Although
these animals are so abundant in favoured localities as to make hard-beaten
tracks to and fro betwixt their rock-dwellings and their pasture-grounds,
one may traverse the country in broad daylight without catching a glimpse
of a single individual. One species, about the size of a large rabbit, is
very plentiful among the rocky bastion-like hills that border the Ord
River, which flows into Cambridge Gulf, in Western Australia. Efforts to
stalk examples in broad daylight proved fruitless; but by sallying out a
little before daybreak, so as to arrive at their feeding-grounds while the
light was still dim, the writer succeeded in securing several specimens.
Many of these rock-wallabies are notable for the length, fine texture, and
pleasing tints of their fur, their skins on such account being highly
esteemed for the composition of carriage-rugs and other furry articles.

TREE-KANGAROOS.

Examples acclimatised in the Melbourne Zoological Gardens.]

Of the larger brush or scrub varieties, the species known as the BLACK
WALLABY is the most familiar form. It is particularly abundant in the
Southern Australian States, and also in Tasmania. Its flesh is excellent
eating, and, dressed and served up in the orthodox manner of jugged hare,
can scarcely be distinguished from that toothsome dish. Some of the smaller
species, such as the hare- and rat-kangaroos or potoroos, are, as their
names denote, of no larger dimensions than the familiar rodents from which
they are popularly named. Several of these smaller species, including
notably the potoroo, or kangaroo-rat of New South Wales, are addicted to
paying marked attention to the settlers' gardens, and, being to a large
extent root-feeders, have acquired a special predilection for the newly
planted or more fully matured potato crops.

GAIMARD'S RAT-KANGAROO.

A species named after the French naturalist, Gaimard.]

The most abnormal group of the Kangaroo Family is undoubtedly that of the
TREE-KANGAROOS, formerly supposed to have been limited in its distribution
to the island of New Guinea, but which has within recent years been found
to be represented by one or more species in Northern Queensland. At the
Melbourne Zoo they have been found, except in the coldest weather, to
thrive well in the open--a moderate-sized tree, with a small fenced-in
enclosure around it, being admirably suited to their requirements, at the
same time providing a most instructive exhibition of their peculiar forms
and idiosyncrasies. Seen at its best, however, the tree-kangaroo, or
"boongarry," as it is known amongst the Queensland natives, is a most
clumsy, melancholy-looking beast, which has apparently found itself "up a
tree," not as the outcome of its personal predilections, but owing to the
_force majeure_ of untoward pressure in the form either of relentlessly
persecuting enemies or the failure of its normal terrestrial commissariat.
Compared with the graceful and superlatively agile tree-frequenting
phalangers, between whom and the ordinary kangaroos it has been sometimes,
but erroneously, regarded as representing a connecting-link, the boongarry
presents a most ungainly contrast. Its climbing powers are of the slowest
and most awkward description, the whole of its energies being concentrated
on its endeavour to preserve its balance and to retain a tight hold upon
the branches of the trees it frequents, and to which it clings with such
tenacity with its long sharp claws that it can with difficulty be detached.
In its wild state, moreover, these claws can be very effectively used as
weapons of defence; and hence the natives, with whom the animal is highly
esteemed as an article of food, are careful to give it its quietus with
their clubs or waddies before venturing to handle it. The tree-kangaroos
inhabit the densest parts of the forests or "scrubs" of New Guinea and
tropical Queensland, and appear to confine their movements chiefly to the
trees of moderate size, or the lower branches only of the taller ones.

The species which constitutes the most natural known connecting-link
between the typical Kangaroos and the family of the Phalangers, next
described, is the FIVE-TOED RAT-KANGAROO, or POTOROO. As its name implies,
it is a small creature of rat-like aspect and dimensions, and possesses,
like a rat, a long, cylindrical, naked, scaly tail. It is the structure of
the feet, however, that constitutes the important distinction. In place of
the four toes only to the hind limbs it possesses the full complement of
five, and the first toe, moreover, is set farther back, and is opposable
for grasping purposes. This animal is from Queensland.

THE PHALANGERS.

The Phalanger Family of Marsupials, which next invites attention, is
constituted of animals especially adapted to lead an arboreal life, though
among themselves they exhibit very considerable structural variations. The
species usually placed at the head of this group is the essentially droll
and in many respects abnormal form known as the KOALA, or AUSTRALIAN NATIVE
BEAR. Its little podgy tailless body, short thick-set head, and round
tufted ears lend some countenance perhaps to the ursine analogy; but there
the likeness ends.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

KOALA, OR AUSTRALIAN NATIVE BEAR AND CUB.

An excellent illustration of the way in which the female koalas carry their
young securely perched on their backs.]

The koala is limited in its distribution to the south-eastern region of the
Australian Continent, and is there found inhabiting the loftiest gum-trees,
on the leaves and flowers of which it almost exclusively feeds. Compared
with the opossum and squirrel-like phalangers, the koala is a very slow and
sedentary little animal, remaining stationary in and browsing upon the
leaves of the same gum-tree for days or even weeks at a stretch. Taking
advantage of this home-staying propensity, examples are established, with
full liberty to wander at will among the large gum-trees, in the Melbourne
Zoological Gardens, and have never abused the confidence reposed in them by
surreptitiously absconding. The young koalas in particular make the most
droll and delightful of household pets, speedily becoming attached to and
following their owners about the premises, or contentedly settling down to
the possession of an allotted corner of the verandah, in which an
improvised perch has been erected and a constant supply of its favourite
gum-leaves is daily assured. One such example, kept in Brisbane,
Queensland, furnished the writer with the material for the photograph on
this page; also of another one that illustrated in an interesting manner
the very singular attitude assumed by the animal when asleep. Instead of
creeping into the hollow trunk or spout of a gum or other tree, as the
opossums and other phalangers are wont to do, the little "bear" simply
sticks tight to his supporting branch, and, tucking in his head and ears
and limbs, converts himself into an apparently homogeneous rounded mass of
fur or moss, and, thus disguised, peacefully sleeps. Seen at some little
distance, in fact, none but a trained eye could distinguish this sleeping
bear from one of the round woody excrescences or bunches of misletoe-like
parasitic growths that are of common occurrence on the trees in every gum
forest. In this way the little creature secures immunity from the attacks
of enemies by mimicking the characteristic peculiarities of its
environment, as obtains so generally among insects and other of the lower
orders of animated nature. A closely analogous sleeping attitude, it may be
mentioned, is assumed by one of the African lemurs or pottos, which have
been dealt with in a previous chapter.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

KOALA, OR AUSTRALIAN NATIVE BEAR.

The koala has no tail, and is a stout, clumsily built animal, about 32
inches in length, with thick woolly fur of a greyish colour.]

Although in captivity the koala takes kindly to a mixed diet in which
bread-and-milk and fruit may form substantial elements, it can rarely be
induced to altogether dispense with its customary gum-leaf regimen, and it
is this circumstance that mainly accounts for its rarity in European
menageries. Time and again, however, this interesting animal has put in an
appearance at the Regent's Park; but in spite of Kew Gardens and other
sources being laid under contribution for a supply of gum-tree leaves, its
sojourn there has been but brief. As a matter of fact, the common or blue
gum-tree, which is alone cultivated and available in any quantity in this
country, and which is indigenous to Tasmania, is not the species on which
the koala is accustomed to feed. Of gum-trees there are some hundred
species, every one differing in the peculiarity of its aromatic scent and
flavour, and having its special clientèle among the ranks of leaf-browsing
animals. So far as the writer's observations extended, it was the big
Queensland "white" and "swamp" gums that were especially patronised by the
Australian bears, and these are not grown in England.

Although at first sight, and normally so far as the younger individuals are
concerned, the koala would appear to represent the most perfect embodiment
of peace and goodwill among mammals, he is accredited at a maturer age,
when crossed in love or goaded to resentment by some other cause, to give
way to fits of ungovernable rage. These temporary lapses are, however, very
transient, and our little friend soon recovers his customary bland
placidity. While it is being threshed out, nevertheless, the "burden of
song" delivered by rival claimants for a partner's favours is a remarkable
phenomenon. The circumstance that the vocal duet is commonly executed high
up among the branches of the loftiest gums no doubt adds very considerably
to both the timbre of the "music" and the distance to which it is carried.
The old-time phrase of "making the welkin ring" would undoubtedly have been
applied with alacrity and singular appropriateness by the poets of the
departed century to the love-song of the koala, had they been privileged to
hear it.

Among the examples of the koala which have been in residence at the Zoo,
one of them came to a pathetic end. As told to the writer by Mr. A. D.
Bartlett, the late superintendent, it appears that the little animal, on
exhibition in the gardens during the day, was brought into the house at
night, and allowed the run of a room which, among other furniture, included
a large swing looking-glass. One morning the little creature was found
crushed to death beneath the mirror, upon which it had apparently climbed
and over-balanced. The information that the animal was a female evoked the
suspicion that personal vanity and the admiration of its own image in the
glass had some share in compassing its untimely end. Possibly, however, it
hailed in the reflection the welcome advent of a companion to share its
lone banishment from the land of the gum-tree, and in its efforts to greet
it thus came to grief.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

KOALA, OR AUSTRALIAN NATIVE BEAR.

These animals make a peculiarly plaintive cry when molested in any way by
human beings.]

The female koala produces but one cub at a time. At an early period after
its birth this is transferred to its mother's back, and is thus transported
until its dimensions are about one-half of those of its parent. The pair as
shown in the illustration on page 355 presents, under these conditions, an
essentially grotesque aspect.

It is a noteworthy circumstance that, compared with the male, the female
koala is but rarely to be observed wandering abroad during broad daylight.
As with the typical phalangers food is consumed chiefly at night or during
the brief Australian twilight hours. While the male at certain periods,
more especially the months of March and April, is much in evidence in
daytime to both the senses of sight and hearing, as attested to on a
previous page, the female spends the whole or greater portion of the day
clinging as an inert sleeping mass to a convenient branch. "Bear"-shooting
in Australia, as might be anticipated from the description here given of
the animal's habits and temperament, affords but sorry sport. It may
further be remarked that those who have shot at and only disabled one of
these inoffensive little creatures are scarcely likely to repeat the
experiment. The cry of a wounded koala has been aptly compared to that of a
distressed child, but still more pathetic. When fatally shot, it also more
frequently than otherwise clings tenaciously back-downwards, like the South
American sloths, to the supporting tree-branch, and is thus frequently
irrecoverable. With the non-sentimental Australian furrier the koala's pelt
of soft, crisp, ashy-grey fur is unfortunately in considerable demand,
being made up mostly, with the quaint round head and tufted ears intact,
into, it must be confessed, singularly attractive and warm rugs.

The correspondence of the koala in form and habits to the sloths among the
higher mammalia has been previously mentioned. The parallelism might be
pursued in yet another direction. In earlier times the small
tree-inhabiting South American sloths were supplemented by
ground-frequenting species, such as the Megatherium, which were of
comparatively titanic proportions. The epoch of the accredited existence of
these huge ground-sloths was so comparatively recent--the later
tertiaries--that it is even yet not regarded as altogether improbable that
some existing representative of the race may yet be discovered in the
fastnesses of the South American forests, and thus claim a niche in the
pages of a subsequent edition of "LIVING ANIMALS." In a like manner the
little sloth-like tree-frequenting "Australian Bear" had his primeval
ground-dwelling colossi, and there is yet a lurking hope among enthusiastic
zoologists that some surviving scion of the little koala's doughty
forebears may yet turn up in the practically unexplored Central Australian
wildernesses. Some such anticipations, as a matter of fact, stimulated the
hopes and aspirations of the participators in one of the latest of these
exploring expeditions, which, while not successful in this instance in
obtaining so great a prize, secured for science that most interesting and
previously unknown marsupial mammal the Pouched Mole.

THE TYPICAL PHALANGERS.

The typical PHALANGERS, or OPOSSUMS, as they are familiarly known
throughout Australia, include a very considerable number of
representatives, ranging in size from that of a small mouse to that of a
full-grown cat. All are essentially arboreal in their habits, feeding
principally on the leaves and flowers of the various gums. They are for the
most part strictly nocturnal in their habits, and make their homes and
retiring-places during the day in the hollow trunks and limbs that are of
such abundant occurrence in the periodically fire-swept Australian forests.
Almost all the larger species are notable for the length, thickness, and
exquisitely fine texture of their fur, a circumstance for which they are
consequently laid under heavy penalties for the sake of their pelts. The
island colony of Tasmania, in the extreme south, with its colder climate,
as might be anticipated, produces the finest qualities of these furs, that
of the BLACK or SOOTY OPOSSUM, which is peculiar to the island, being most
highly prized. The length and furry character of their in many instances
prehensile tails also form a conspicuous feature of this group. Nature, in
fact, apparently distributed caudal material so over-liberally among these
marsupials that the little koala had to make shift without.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

LARGER FLYING-PHALANGER.

A nearly pure white example.]

The group of the Phalanger Family popularly known as FLYING-SQUIRRELS, or
more correctly as FLYING-PHALANGERS, is almost universally admitted to
include some of the most beautiful of living mammals. In external
structure, so far as their peculiar so-called "flying" mechanism is
concerned, these animals coincide in a remarkable manner with the true
flying-squirrels, belonging to the Rodent Order, indigenous to the Asiatic
and American Continents. In neither instance is there flight, in the true
sense of the term, similar to that of birds and bats, but the fore and hind
limbs are connected by a parachute-like membrane, which, outstretched when
the animal leaps from tree to tree, buoys it up and enables its owner to
traverse, in a straight and gradually descending line only, very
considerable distances.

The smaller squirrel-like form common to the south-eastern districts of
Australia, and on account of its predilection for sweets commonly known as
the SUGAR-SQUIRREL, makes a most charming little pet. For the most part
addicted to sleep, and impatient at being disturbed during the day, towards
sundown it wakes up, and is full of frolic. One such example was the
writer's travelling companion for a considerable interval in Western
Australia. While remaining packed conveniently away in a small box
throughout the day, it was accustomed to enjoy the liberty of whatever
apartment its owner occupied in the evening and throughout the night,
returning of its own accord to its sleeping-box with the approach of dawn.
On one exceptional occasion, however, Master Tiny, as this individual was
named, was missing in the morning from his accustomed crib, and a prolonged
search and examination of every corner and article of furniture that could
afford shelter failed to recover him. That the little creature was lost
through some one having unwittingly left the door of the apartment open,
permitting its escape, was the only and much-deplored conclusion that could
be arrived at. Towards evening, however, there was a slight rustle close at
hand, and Master Tiny was discovered emerging, like Minerva from the head
of Jupiter, from the top of one of the old-fashioned china dogs that
decorated the hotel-room mantelpiece. The ornament, seemingly intact from
the front, had the back of the head battered in. Through the resulting
crevice the little animal had managed to squeeze itself, having come to the
conclusion, doubtless, that this newly chosen retreat more nearly resembled
the cavernous shelter of its native tree-spout than its accustomed
artificially constructed box. This singular domicile Master Tiny was
permitted to monopolise for the remainder of his sojourn at that hostelry.
One of the favourite diversions of this little phalanger during the
evenings was to climb up the curtain and cornice of the room he occupied,
and thence hurl himself through the air with outspread parachute to the
writer at the opposite end. The apartment, happening to be the commercial
room of the hotel, some thirty feet in length, gave him good scope for
exercising his characteristic flying leaps. The attitude invariably
maintained during these flights is aptly illustrated in the accompanying
photograph; the body is never poised with the head inclined downwards, as
is commonly depicted in artists' fancy sketches of the animal contained in
popular natural histories. A friend of the writer's in Tasmania, who kept
one of these flying-phalangers as a household pet, was accustomed to leave
a crevice of the window open at night, so that the little fellow could go
in and out as it liked. After the manner of most pets, however, a day
arrived upon which its box was found vacant, a marauding cat or other
disaster having apparently compassed its untimely end.

PYGMY FLYING-PHALANGER.

A life-size photograph. The hairs of the tail in this animal are arranged
in two parallel lines, like the vanes of a bird's feather.]

The larger flying-phalanger, the dimensions of our domestic tabby, and with
fur as long and as soft as the Persian variety, is less frequently
domesticated. It has, in fact, an evil reputation for scratching, biting,
and general untamableness. One that was kept for some little time by the
late Dr. Bennett, of Sydney, and brought to England, never entirely lost
its innate savagery. On the voyage from Australia it became sufficiently
tame as to be allowed occasionally to run about on the deck, and was so far
amiable as to lay on its back and permit itself to be tickled. On
attempting to handle it, however, "it displayed its usual savage
disposition, digging its sharp claws and teeth into the bands of its
captor." The writer was fortunate in being the recipient in Queensland of a
couple of these large phalangers which were exceptions to the usual rule.
These specimens--a mother and its young male offspring--also varied in
colour from normal examples, which are usually dark slate or blackish brown
above and whitish underneath. The mother in this instance was a beautiful
cream-white throughout; and her young one, while dark chinchilla-grey upon
the back, limbs, and tail, had white ears and breast. Both were very
friendly, and would of their own accord climb over their owner's person,
seeking in his pockets for hidden lumps of sugar and other acceptable
dainties. As with the smaller squirrel-like forms, they slept throughout
the greater portion of the day, waking to activity and making excursions in
search of their food as soon as the sun went down. The tail of this species
of phalanger is abnormally long and furry, but not prehensile. It was
observed of them that when feeding leisurely on the gum-tree leaves this
appendage was permitted to hang or rest loosely, but that when walking
along the branches they would very frequently coil this member into a tight
spiral coil, like a watch-spring or the proboscis of a butterfly, against
their hindquarters. This phenomenon is apparently unique among mammals.
Although generally seeking the darker retreat of their box for their long
daylight sleep, the female, more particularly, would frequently simply curl
herself up into a furry white ball in one corner of the cage, the head,
limbs, or other features being at such times altogether indistinguishable.
The aid of the magnesium flash-light was successfully called into service
to secure the photographic likeness of this animal, here reproduced, which
was taken while it was enjoying its evening meal.

COMMON GREY OPOSSUM, OR PHALANGER.

The fur of this species is in great demand for the manufacture of
carriage-rugs.]

As previously mentioned, some representatives of the flying-phalanger group
are no larger than mice, and are furnished in a similar manner with a
parachute-like membrane that enables them to take abnormally long flying
leaps, or as it were to sail horizontally through the air. The PYGMY
FLYING-PHALANGER, whose length of body does not exceed 2½ inches, is one of
the most interesting. The tail in this form is also adapted for aerial
flotation, the long hairs that grow upon this appendage being arranged in
two parallel lines like the vanes of a feather. Its distribution is limited
to the south and eastern districts of the Australian Continent. There are
also a number of mouse- and squirrel-like phalangers destitute of the
flying-membrane, which in this respect very closely resemble in external
aspect more typical members of the Rodent Order. One form in particular,
the STRIPED PHALANGER of New Guinea, decorated with broad longitudinal
black and white stripes, is singularly suggestive of some of the variously
striped American squirrels. This interesting island of New Guinea also
produces a little PYGMY PHALANGER with a feather-like tail which, except
for the absence of a parachute or flying-membrane, is the very counterpart
of the Australian kind. Another species, which in shape, size, and more
especially with reference to its long, pointed snout, closely resembles a
shrew-mouse, is found in Western Australia. The tail of this species, known
as the LONG-SNOUTED PHALANGER, is highly prehensile; and it is also
provided with a long, slender, protrusile tongue, with which it abstracts
the honey from Banksias and other flowers, upon which it customarily feeds.

The two large phalangers known as the BLACK and GREY or VULPINE OPOSSUMS,
which are chiefly laid under contribution for the Australian fur supplies,
are provided with prehensile tails, the under side of the extremity of
which grasps the supporting fulcrum and is devoid of hair. The adaptation
of the tail for use as a fifth hand--as in the New World monkeys--is,
however, much more conspicuously manifested in what are known to the
colonists as the RING-TAILED OPOSSUMS, and to zoologists as
CRESCENT-TOOTHED PHALANGERS. In these the tail tapers to a fine point, and
the hair throughout the terminal third of this appendage is so fine and
short that it at first sight presents the appearance of being entirely
naked. This terminal third of the tail, moreover, in the greater number of
species, contrasts with the remaining portion by being white in hue. It
occasionally happens, however, that individuals occur which are entirely
white. One such which came into the writer's possession was obtained from
the Bruni Islands, in the Derwent Estuary, Tasmania, and afterwards became
a great pet with the young people at Government House, Hobart. It is an
interesting circumstance that the Bruni Islands were noted for the
production of albino animals of various descriptions, white kangaroos and
white emus having also been obtained from this locality. Probably some
peculiarity of the soil, and its action on the vegetable food the animals
consumed, played an important part in the unusually frequent occurrence of
this phenomenon.

The ring-tailed opossums differ essentially from the common opossum or
phalanger and its allies in their life habits. While these latter
habitually take up their abode and bring forth their young in hollow trees,
the ring-tailed species construct a regular nest of interlaced sticks,
leaves, grass, or any other available material for their domicile. The
structure much resembles the nest, or "drey," of our own familiar European
squirrel, and may be perched high up among the tree branches or within only
a few feet from the ground among the scrub thickets. In New Guinea a
variety of these ring-tailed phalangers occurs, not found in Australia,
which has no white tip to its tail, and the ears are very short and wide.
The group as represented by this species leads to the consideration of the
so-called CUSCUSES or typical phalangers indigenous to New Guinea and North
Queensland, though but rarely seen there, which, as an exception to the
Marsupial Tribe, are distributed among the Indo-Malay Islands as far
westward as Celebes. In the cuscuses the tail is altogether naked, and
pre-eminently prehensile throughout almost its entire terminal moiety; the
ears are round and, proportionately, exceedingly small; while the fur is
very short, thick, and woolly. Compared with the opossums or phalangers,
the cuscuses are very dull and sluggish in their movements, creeping slowly
among the branches of the trees to browse on the fruit and leaves which
constitute their principal diet. Like the opossums, however, or even to a
greater extent, they vary this vegetarian regimen with insects or an
occasionally captured bird.

THE CUSCUSES.

The familiar SPOTTED CUSCUS of New Guinea is the most ornate marsupial
mammal. The males, more especially, are as variegated in colour as a
tortoiseshell cat, their tints, moreover, closely corresponding in hue with
those of the feline. No two individuals, however, are precisely alike in
this respect. Usually the ground-colour of the back is a dirty or creamy
white, interspersed with various-shaped blotches of nut-brown or black; the
chin, breast, and under-parts are a purer white, and the limbs grey or
reddish brown, or, as shown in the photograph over-leaf, mottled like the
body. The BLACK CUSCUS of Celebes is, as its name denotes, a much more
sombre-looking animal, and is also the largest species, its dimensions
equalling or exceeding those of a large cat. The uniformly tinted GREY
CUSCUS of Timor, Amboina, and other of the Indo-Malay Islands is very
similar in size and aspect, excepting for the half-naked tail, to the
common ring-tailed phalanger. All the cuscuses are of rare occurrence in
even their most favoured habitats. On one occasion the writer came across
an example of the grey species in the scrub forest of Thursday Island,
Torres Straits. In this instance, however, it is doubtful if the animal was
not an escaped pet brought over from the neighbouring coast of New Guinea.

RING-TAILED OPOSSUM, OR PHALANGER, AND NEST.

This is the only Australian opossum which builds a regular nest.]

Much interesting information concerning different varieties of the cuscus
is contained in Dr. Alfred Wallace's interesting work "The Malay
Archipelago." An anecdote of one which was brought to this naturalist
during his residence in the Aru Islands--the headquarters of the great bird
of paradise--is thus related: "Just as we had cleared away and packed up
for the night, a strange beast was brought, which had been shot by the
natives. It resembled in size and in its white woolly covering a small fat
lamb, but had short legs, hand-like feet with large claws, and a long
prehensile tail. It was a Spotted Cuscus, one of the curious marsupial
animals of the Papuan region, and I was very desirous to obtain the skin.
The owners, however, said they wanted to eat it; and though I offered them
a good price, and promised to give them all the meat, there was great
hesitation. Suspecting the reason, I offered, though it was night, to set
to work immediately, and get out the body for them, to which they agreed.
The creature was much hacked about, and the two hind feet almost cut off,
but it was the largest and finest specimen of the kind I had seen; and
after an hour's hard work I handed over the body to the owners, who
immediately cut it up and roasted it for supper."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Croydon._

SPOTTED CUSCUS.

The cuscuses are sleepy animals, with soft, woolly fur, which in this
species is curiously variegated in colour.]

The remarkable tenacity of life possessed by the cuscus is fully attested
to by Dr. Wallace. He says: "They move about slowly, and are most difficult
to kill, owing to the thickness of their skins and tenacity of life. A
heavy charge of shot will often lodge in the skin and do them no harm, and
even breaking the spine or piercing the brain will not kill them for some
hours. The natives everywhere eat their flesh; and as their motions are so
slow, easily catch them by climbing; so that it is wonderful that they have
not been exterminated. It may be, however, that their dense woolly fur
protects them from birds of prey, and the islands they live in are too
thinly inhabited for man to be able to exterminate them."

One of the most notable circumstances respecting the cuscus is the fact
that it is one of the few marsupials whose geographical distribution
extends so far east in the Malay Archipelago as to be found associated with
many of the higher mammalia which are altogether unrepresented in Australia
or New Guinea. The Moluccas, including notably the islands of Silolo,
Ceram, Boru, and many smaller ones, for example, produce no less than three
species of cuscus, and are also the home of a species of baboon, a
civet-cat, a deer, and that remarkable pig the babirusa. One other
marsupial, a little flying-phalanger, is likewise a denizen of these
islands. It has been suggested by Dr. Wallace that none of the foregoing
higher mammals are possibly indigenous to the Moluccas. The baboon, he
remarks, is only found in the island of Batchian, and seems to be much out
of place there. It probably originated from some individuals which escaped
from confinement, these and similar animals being often kept as pets by the
Malay inhabitants and carried about in their praus. The civet-cat, which is
more common in the Philippines and throughout the Indo-Malay region, is
also carried about in cages from one island to another, and not
infrequently liberated after the civet has been abstracted from them. The
deer, which is likewise tamed and petted, its flesh also being much
esteemed for food, might very naturally have been brought by the Malays
from Java with the express object of its acclimatisation. The babirusa,
whose headquarters are in the island of Celebes, is only found in Boru, its
nearest neighbour in the Moluccan group. Dr. Wallace anticipates that these
two islands were in former times more closely connected by land, and that
under such conditions the babirusa may have swum across the intervening
channel. Should these several hypotheses be correct, the Molucca Islands
must be regarded, from a zoological standpoint, as an essentially
Australasian or marsupial-producing region.


THE WOMBATS.

The Wombat Family, claiming the next position in the marsupial galaxy,
constitutes the very antithesis to the light and graceful arboreal
phalangers. There are but three known species, one of these inhabiting
Tasmania and the adjacent islands, while the other two are peculiar to the
southern region of the Australian Continent. In forms and gait their
thick-set tailless bodies suggest a cross between a small bear and a
capybara, and as "bears" and "badgers" they are familiarly known by the
Australian colonists. The badger simile is perhaps the most pertinently
applied with reference to their habit of excavating huge earth-burrows as
dwelling-places, and out of which they customarily emerge only at night to
feed. The TASMANIAN WOMBAT, at all events, is essentially gregarious in its
habits; In the neighbourhood of Swansea, on the east coast, it is, or was,
particularly abundant, forming regular warrens among a light undergrowth of
vegetation, through which travelling on horseback is a distinctly risky
proceeding. The temperament of the wombat is peculiarly placid; and hence,
as it might be anticipated, they are essentially long-lived. One, Charlie
by name, which has been domiciled at the Zoo for the past thirty years, is
still hale and hearty, and evidently disinclined yet awhile to immolate
himself on the altar of fame as a much-needed successor to the antique
effigy which has for so long represented his species in the British Natural
History Museum. Waiting for dead men's shoes is a proverbially tedious
task, and for a coveted wombat's skin evidently more so.

The tough hide, with its thick, harsh fur, of the Tasmanian wombat, or
"badger," as it is locally dubbed, is somewhat highly prized in the land of
its birth. For floor- and door-mats and rugs the pelt is practically
indestructible; and as such, though scarcely a thing of beauty, the special
pride of the thrifty housewife. This animal is also not infrequently made a
household pet, and will waddle as complacently as an over-fed poodle around
the premises after its owner. The wombat, like the large majority of the
marsupial animals, is for the most part nocturnal in habits, and a strict
vegetarian.

The wombats present several interestingly distinct structural
peculiarities. In the first place, their teeth, which are twenty-four in
number, all grow uninterruptedly throughout life, and are consequently
devoid of roots. The incisor teeth are represented by but a single pair in
each jaw, and, having enamel only on their front surfaces, wear away in a
chisel-like form, as in the beavers and other rodents. Superficially in
both form and habits, as well as in the character of their dentition, the
wombats may in fact be aptly likened to some unwieldy representative of the
Rodent Order. Another structural peculiarity of the wombat is that it is
the proud possessor of two more pairs of ribs than any other marsupial.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

COMMON WOMBAT.

A burrowing animal about the size of a small pig.]

Of the three known species, the COMMON WOMBAT of the South and Eastern
Australian States is the largest, attaining to a length of as much as 3
feet. The colour of this form is subject to considerable variation, being
sometimes yellow, yellow more or less mixed with black, or completely
black. Albinism, as in the kangaroos and phalangers, is of apparently rare
occurrence. The hair, while coarse, is less so than in the Tasmanian
species. What is known as the HAIRY-NOSED WOMBAT, inhabiting South
Australia, is intermediate in size between the common and the Tasmanian
varieties; its most distinctive features are the soft and silky character
of its brownish hair, and its longer and more pointed ears. The coarseness
of the hair of the Tasmanian species has been previously referred to; in
colour it is most usually a dark greyish brown, while the ears are small
and rounded.

The flesh of the wombat is somewhat esteemed for food, being regarded by
some as equal to pork, and much resembling it in flavour. The predilection
of tame specimens for milk is very strong, and it has been recorded of one
animal that it was not only in the habit of seeking out the milk-pans and
pushing off the covers in order to drink the contents, but afterwards of
taking a bath in what was left.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Landor_]     [_Ealing._

HAIRY-NOSED WOMBAT.

A form peculiar to South Australia.]

A remarkable habit has been accredited to the wombat which invites
scientific investigation. It is said to be capable of sustaining life for
an abnormally long period under water, and that when in the course of its
travels it meets with a pond or river it does not attempt to swim, but,
deliberately entering the water, walks along the bottom, and so emerges on
the opposite bank.

The animals of Australia living in not very remote geological times
included a near ally of the wombat which equalled a tapir in dimensions.


THE BANDICOOTS.

The Australian BANDICOOTS--not to be confounded with their namesake of
India, which is a big rat--constitute a very distinct little family group.
They number in all some eight or nine species, distributed throughout the
length and breadth of Australia and Tasmania, and found also in New Guinea.
The largest member is about the size of a rabbit; and as its general shape,
long ears, and soft silky hair impart some slight resemblance to that
rodent, it is commonly known as the RABBIT-BANDICOOT. With the
above-enumerated points, however, the likeness ceases--its possession of a
moderately long tail, pointed snout, and feet modified on a plan closely
resembling those of the kangaroo's indicating its essentially distinct
nature. In a second variety, having somewhat the same external contour, but
smaller in size, the fore limbs are very short, and the feet so modified
that only two toes are visible externally. With reference to this peculiar
feature, it is known as the PIG-FOOTED BANDICOOT. In a third kind of
similar dimensions, with harsh brown fur, the ears are comparatively short,
and the snout is so abnormally prolonged that, it has been appropriately
named the LONG-NOSED BANDICOOT. Superficially, in point of fact, this and
other allied species so closely resemble certain of the long-snouted
insectivorous mammals, such as the Tenrec and Solenodon, that they might be
excusably mistaken by the non-scientific for members of the same group. The
bandicoots are chiefly nocturnal, and at all events incorrigible
"sun-downers," turning up for their meals when the evening shadows fall,
and taking a heavy and unwelcome toll of the farmers' potatoes, beets, or
other root, crops. Like the wombat, already described, they are
earth-burrowers. Some of them, however, construct nests above-ground in
long coarse grass or low tangled shrubs, which are so ingeniously built in
accord with their environment as to readily escape detection. Insects and
worms, in addition to a main diet of vegetable matter, contribute to the
bandicoot's somewhat heterogeneous menu.

COMMON WOMBAT.

The Wombats may be said to hold the place occupied in other parts of the
world by the Badgers.]

The wood- and root-boring larvæ of a moth which infests the Australian
wattle- or acacia-trees are a very favourite food with several of the
species, and it is worthy of remark that the bandicoots are not alone in
displaying a penchant for this delicacy. Under the title of "bardies" they
are collected and highly esteemed for food by the natives of Western
Australia, who eat them either cooked or raw. These larvæ are, moreover,
acceptable to many European palates, and the writer has witnessed little
faggot-like bundles of them brought round by the natives to the hotels at
Geraldton, Western Australia, for sale or barter to chance customers. It
may be observed in this connection that the analogous wood-boring larvæ of
the goat-moth, which were kept and specially fattened for the occasion,
constituted one of the dainty dishes of the luxurious Romans.

One of the commonest species found in Tasmania is known as the BANDED or
STRIPED-BACKED BANDICOOT, being so named on account of the characteristic
markings of its fur. The general ground-colour of the coat is an almost
equal admixture of black and yellow hairs, the black tint, however,
prevailing on the back, and the lighter one on the sides. The hindquarters
are, however, variegated by the presence of some three or four broad
transverse stripes that are almost entirely black, while the intervening
spaces are a light whitish yellow. A few shorter stripes are sometimes
continued as far as the root of the tail, this appendage also having a dark
line running along its upper surface. The head is of a somewhat lighter
tint than the remainder of the body, while the breast, abdomen, and feet
are white, slightly tinged with grey. The transversely striped pattern of
ornamentation of the hindquarters of this bandicoot is of interest with
relation to the circumstance that a similarly located banded variegation of
the fur occurs also in the Tasmanian wolf, or thylacine, and in the banded
ant-eater, described in a following section. As a colour-pattern it would
appear to be quite peculiar to these marsupials, no such restriction of the
markings occurring among the higher or placental mammals. In the South
African suricate, a member of the Ichneumon Tribe, in which the nearest
approach to this dorsal banding is met with, the stripes are equally
developed as far forward as the base of the neck.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

LONG-NOSED AUSTRALIAN BANDICOOT.

Bandicoots, although larger, have somewhat the appearance of shrews.]

Both the banded and other species of bandicoots are extremely swift and
active in their movements, and are at the same time noted for the
singularity of their gait. This consists of a half-running and half-jumping
action, induced by the peculiar structure of their feet and greater length
of the hind legs, which are modified on a plan intermediate between that of
the kangaroos and the dasyures, or native cats. The back of the animal
while running being highly arched, adds to the grotesqueness of its
appearance. Like the native cats, the pouch in the bandicoots opens
backwards; it is furnished with eight teats, but not more than two young
are usually produced at a birth.

The striped-backed bandicoot is not infrequently adopted as a household
pet, in spite of its notorious garden depredations. When thus domesticated,
it appears to be capable of developing a strong attachment for its owner.
One that was owned by friends of the writer especially attached itself to
the lady of the house. It was acquired when quite young, having escaped
from the pouch of an adult female which the dogs had killed, and being then
about the size of a mouse. It speedily learned to lap milk, and throve on a
diet of bread and raw potato. As it grew larger it was allowed the run of
the house, and also of the garden, but habitually returned to the
sleeping-quarters selected by itself, and represented by the woolly depths
of its mistress's work-basket. In this haven of rest it slept all day,
scolding and snapping at any intruding hand. Towards dusk it would waken up
and bustle about in a most energetic manner, with the air, in fact, of
having an immense amount of business to transact within the very shortest
limits of time. Its first dart was always towards a corner where a supper
of bread-and-milk and potato was usually placed. This meal discussed, its
evening's occupation commenced of scampering around the room and over every
accessible article of furniture. Nor was it shy of climbing up and resting
for a few seconds on the shoulders of its human friends, being always,
however, in too great a hurry to prolong the visit. Finally, as with all
pets, "Coota," as he was familiarly named, came to an untimely end--not a
cat, however, on this occasion, but, if rumour whispers true, through
over-indulgence in a too liberally furnished meal of custard pudding.

RABBIT-BANDICOOT.

The flesh of this and other species of bandicoots is esteemed for food both
by the natives and the white settlers in Australia. It is noteworthy of the
banded variety, more especially, that the skin adheres so tightly to the
flesh that its removal is a matter of some considerable difficulty. When
full grown, this species measures as much as 18 inches in total length, and
is little inferior to a rabbit with regard to the amount of good meat it
provides for the larder.


THE POUCHED MOLE.

A still more essentially insectivorous marsupial is represented by the
little mammal discovered only a few years since in the wild sandy wastes of
Central Australia. In form and habits it so nearly resembles the familiar
European mole that the title of the POUCHED MOLE has been very suitably
given to it. At the same time, with regard to its remarkable organisation,
it constitutes the sole representative of its peculiar family group. The
first suspicions of the existence of this singular little animal were
raised by the observation of peculiar sinuous three-lined tracks at
irregular intervals on the surface of the sandy regions it inhabits.

After a long quest, with the aid of the aborigines, the first specimen was
discovered reposing under a tuft of coarse porcupine-grass. A further
investigation elicited the fact that its burrowing proclivities were much
less pronounced than those of the ordinary moles, the little creature
progressing alternately over the surface of the sand, and then ploughing
its way, for several feet or yards, two or three inches only beneath the
surface. All efforts to preserve examples of this marsupial alive for
longer periods than three or four days proved abortive; for though the
remains of ants and other insects were found within its viscera, it refused
to feed upon the living supplies that were provided for it. In fact, the
animal itself apparently ran the greater risk of being eaten.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

POUCHED MOLE.

This animal is of a pale golden-red colour, and about 5 inches long. It
spends most of its time burrowing, which it can do with great rapidity, in
the sand of the Australian deserts in search of insects.]

The colour of the pouched mole is for the most part light fawn, varying in
parts to golden yellow. One of its most conspicuous features, as
illustrated in the accompanying photographs, is the abnormal size of the
third and fourth toes of the fore limbs, their peculiar scoop-like
character proving of eminent service to the animal in its customary
sand-burrowing habits.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

THE TASMANIAN WOLF.

The remaining family of the Australian marsupials constitutes a parallel to
the carnivorous order of the higher mammalia, all its members being more or
less flesh-eaters, and having their dentition modified with relation to
such habits. One of these (the TASMANIAN WOLF, or TIGER of the colonists,
better known to zoologists as the THYLACINE) is an animal of considerable
size. Its dimensions equal those of a wolf or mastiff, with which the
contour of its body and more especially that of the head very nearly
correspond. In common with the true dogs, the thylacine hunts its prey by
scent. This is well attested to by the following incident, as related by
eye-witnesses. While camping out among the hills in Tasmania their
attention was attracted very early one morning by a brush-kangaroo hopping
past their fire in an evidently highly excited state. Some ten minutes
later up cantered a she thylacine with her nose down exactly on the track,
evidently following the scent, and in another quarter of an hour her two
cubs came by also in the precise track. While not very swift, the Tasmanian
"tigers" possess immense staying power, and will keep up a long, steady
canter for many hours on end. Accustomed in its primitive state to run down
and prey upon the kangaroos, wallabies, and other weaker marsupial mammals
indigenous to the regions it inhabits, the Tasmanian wolf speedily acquired
a predilection for the imported flocks of the settlers, and proved almost
as destructive to them as its Old World namesake. To check its ravages, a
price was put upon its head by the Tasmanian Government; and this measure,
in conjunction with the rapid advances towards the complete settlement of
the country which have been accomplished within later years, has compassed
this animal's extermination in all but the wildest and most inaccessible
mountain districts. The colour-markings of this animal are somewhat
striking, the grey-brown tints which characterise the ground-hues of the
body and limbs being varied by a series of dark bands traversing the
buttocks, these being widest in this region, and continued forwards to the
middle of the back. A somewhat similar cross-stripe pattern of
ornamentation occurs in the relatively small member of the same family
described later on as the Banded Ant-eater.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S., North Finchley._

TASMANIAN WOLF.

This photograph shows the great width of gape of this ferocious animal.]

Examples of the Tasmanian wolf have frequently been on view at the Regent's
Park Gardens, a very fine young male specimen being at present located in
the marsupial section. Within a few weeks of its arrival it was on
excellent terms with its keeper, though, owing to its somewhat imperfect
sense of vision during the daytime, it was apt to snap somewhat
promiscuously at those attempting to cultivate its close acquaintanceship.
That a bite from its formidable teeth is not to be lightly risked will be
made abundantly apparent by a glance at the successful yawning pose
photograph secured of this example by Mr. Medland, and here reproduced.
Although the thylacine is at the present time entirely limited in its
distribution to Tasmania, it occurs in the fossil state on the Australian
mainland; while, singularly to relate, the remains of a closely allied form
have within recent years been unearthed in Patagonia. This circumstance,
taken in conjunction with the fact that many other fossil types with
Australian and New Zealand affinities have been discovered in the same
South American strata, has strengthened the supposition maintained by many
zoologists that in bygone ages a vast Antarctic continent, spreading
through the areas now occupied by the Southern Indian and Pacific Oceans,
temporarily united the now distinct lands of South America and Australasia.

In this photograph are shown nearly all the chief characteristic points of
the Tasmanian wolf.]


THE TASMANIAN DEVIL.

Next in size to the thylacine, but possessing a more unenviable notoriety
for the uncompromising sulkiness and savagery of its disposition, is the
animal which, in virtue of the aforesaid qualities, is known by the title
of the TASMANIAN DEVIL. In shape and dimensions this marsupial carnivore
somewhat resembles a badger; but the head is abnormally large, the masseter
muscles which control the action of the powerful jaws monopolising a very
considerable share of the face area. The limbs are short and also very
powerful, the front paws being well adapted to its burrowing habits. There
is some slight variation in the colours of this marsupial Apollyon; and, as
the aphorism runs concerning his sable namesake, he is not always so black
as he is painted. More or less or in fact mostly black he always is, but
there is usually a redeeming thread or patch of white upon his coat. This
may take the form of a small star-like spot only on the front of its chest,
which not infrequently extends to a narrow crescent-shaped band or line
continued round the neck almost to the shoulders. One or more supplementary
spots of white may also be developed upon the flanks and hindquarters.

[Illustration: _Photo by York & Son_]     [_Notting Hill._

TASMANIAN DEVIL.

A small, but stout and powerful animal, very destructive, and absolutely
untamable.]

The destructive propensities of the Tasmanian devil, wherein the farmers'
sheep and poultry are concerned, are in no way inferior to those of the
Tasmanian wolf, and in consequence of their former much greater abundance
the havoc these animals committed was the more serious. Placed, like the
last-named type, under Government ban, these native devils have, in
comparison with the earlier days of colonisation, very considerably ceased
from troubling, and with the ever-progressing march of settlement and
civilisation will probably be altogether exterminated at a no very distant
date. A bag of no less than 150 of these marauders, in the course of one
winter, was recorded from an upland sheep-station some twenty or thirty
years ago. In common with the thylacine, it has been observed that the
Tasmanian devil has a marked predilection for prowling along the seashore
in search apparently of crabs, fish, or any acceptable flotsam and jetsam
that may be cast up by the waves.

Examples of this most unamiable of mammals were brought in alive on several
occasions to the Hobart Museum during the writer's residence in Tasmania,
but in all cases obstinately resisted every attempt towards the
establishment of a friendly footing. Their ultimate relegation to the
specimen-cases was, under the circumstances, unattended by any very
poignant manifestations of regret. A fact brought into prominent notice
during subsequent post-mortem investigations was the extraordinary extent
to which these animals are infested with vermin. Possibly this circumstance
is to a considerable extent accountable for the creature's unconquerable
irritability. The experiment as to whether a course of disinfecting
treatment, by baths or otherwise, would not conduce towards the taming of
this native devil, where all other applied methods have failed, would at
all events be worth the trial. The bath pure and simple is a wonderful
soporific for unruly tempers. As most schoolboys know, a pail of water,
from which the patient is withdrawn when a watery grave is apparently
inevitable, is an unfailing specific for the taming of mice and other
"small deer." The writer's experience with a villainously savage cat which
one night fell incontinently into an uncovered cistern, and was rescued by
him at almost the last gasp, will not be readily forgotten. That cat,
though still a vixen to the ordinary members of the household, forthwith
attached itself affectionately to its rescuer, and would sit for hours
awaiting his arrival on the doorstep when the business of the day was over.
Other fierce creatures, including the Tasmanian devil, would possibly prove
amenable to the judicious application of the "water cure."


THE NATIVE CATS.

The animals common in Tasmania and throughout the greater portion of the
Australian Continent, and familiarly known as SPOTTED or NATIVE CATS, and
to zoologists as DASYURES, enjoy also an unenviable reputation for their
depredations among the settlers' hen-roosts. To look at, these native cats
are the most mild-mannered and inoffensive of creatures. Actually, however,
they possess the most bloodthirsty proclivities, and may be aptly compared
in their habits to the stoats, weasels, polecats, and other Old World
carnivora. There are some five known species, the largest being equal to an
ordinary cat in size, and the smaller ones about half these dimensions. All
of them are distinguished by their spotted pattern of ornamentation, such
spots being white or nearly so, and more or less abundantly sprinkled over
a darker background which varies from light grey to chocolate-brown. In the
commonest form, represented in the accompanying photograph, the ears and
the under surface of the body are also often white. No two individuals,
however, are to be found precisely alike in the pattern of their markings.
The dasyures differ from the two preceding types, the Tasmanian wolf and
the devil, in being essentially arboreal in their habits, living by day and
breeding, as the majority of the Australian opossums, in the hollow
gum-tree trunks, from which they emerge at nightfall to seek their food.
This, in their native state, when hen-roosts are not accessible, consists
mainly of birds and such smaller marsupial forms as they can readily
overpower.

SPOTTED DASYURES, OR AUSTRALIAN NATIVE CATS.

This species is rather smaller than an ordinary-sized cat. All the dasyures
are arboreal in their habits, and very destructive to birds.]


THE POUCHED MICE.

The so-called POUCHED MICE represent a group of smaller-sized carnivorous
mammals which have much in common with the dasyures, but are devoid of
their spotted ornamentation. None of them exceed a rat in size. They number
about twelve or fourteen known species, and are distributed throughout the
greater part of Australia and New Guinea, and extend thence to the Aru
Islands. They are said not to occur in the extreme north of the Australian
Continent. The writer, however, obtained an example of the brush-tailed
species, here illustrated, from the neighbourhood of Broome, in the
farthest north or Kimberley district of Western Australia. This specimen,
which was caught alive in a rat-trap, exhibited astonishingly potent
gnawing powers, almost succeeding one night in eating its way through the
wooden box in which it was temporarily confined. The habits of this species
are omnivorous, and chiefly akin to those of the ordinary rats, it being
accustomed to prowl round the out-buildings at night, picking up any
unconsidered trifles in the way of food that may be left unprotected.

BRUSH-TAILED POUCHED MOUSE, OR PHASCOGALE.

A slender and graceful animal, the largest of the thirteen known species,
and about the size of an ordinary rat.]

Many of the smaller members of this tribe are no larger than mice; and in
one form, known as the JERBOA POUCHED MOUSE, inhabiting Queensland and New
South Wales, the hind limbs are abnormally prolonged, and the animal
progresses by leaps and bounds, after the fashion of the true jerboas, or
its nearer relatives, the ordinary kangaroos and rat-kangaroos.


THE BANDED ANT-EATER.

One of the most interesting from the zoologist's standpoint, and the last
on our list of the Australian marsupials, is the little creature, limited
in its habitat to Western Australia, locally known as the SQUIRREL. The
BANDED ANT-EATER, with reference to its striped ornamentation and
ant-eating habits, is the name by which it is usually chronicled in natural
history works. In size and shape, except for its more pointed snout, its
squirrel-like aspect is certainly somewhat striking. Like the true
ant-eaters of the Edentate Mammalian Order, it, however, possesses a long
protrusile tongue, with which it is accustomed in a similar manner to lick
up the ants which constitute its main food-supply.

The most interesting biological peculiarity of this animal is the abnormal
development of its teeth. These number as many as from fifty-two to
fifty-six, and exceed the dental formula of any other known existing
marsupial. The usual colour of this interesting little animal is a warm
chestnut-brown, banded transversely over the back with white, these stripes
being widest and most conspicuous over the hindquarters. This somewhat
paradoxical marsupial possesses no pouch, the young, when first born and
attached to the nipples in the manner characteristic of ordinary
marsupials, being covered over and concealed among the longer hairs that
clothe the abdominal region. In the dasyures, or native cats, previously
described, the pouch exists only in a rudimentary condition, its function
being fulfilled by merely a few skin-folds; while in the "tiger" and native
devil the pouch, contrary to that of the kangaroos, opens backwards.

In disposition the banded ant-eater presents a marked contrast to that of
many of the preceding types. Caught in its native habitat, it does not
attempt to bite, and soon becomes reconciled to captivity. The peculiar
nature of its diet, however, militates against its being easily transported
over-sea from the Antipodes.


THE AMERICAN OPOSSUMS.

The little group of the American marsupials contains some three or four
generically distinct types whose relationship with the Australian members
of the order is in the direction of the dasyures and bandicoots rather than
with the kangaroos and phalangers. Included in one family, they are
popularly known as Opossums, but differ among themselves very considerably
both in aspect and habits. The most remarkable among them is undoubtedly
the so-called YAPOCK, or WATER-OPOSSUM, an inhabitant of South America, and
ranging in its distribution from Guatemala to Brazil. In both form and
habits this animal so closely resembles an otter that it was referred by
the earlier naturalists to the Otter Tribe. It tunnels holes in the banks
of the rivers it frequents, and feeds entirely upon fish, crustacea, and
aquatic insects. The feet, and more especially the hind ones, are
distinctly webbed; the tail is naked, scaly, and non-prehensile; and the
fur is short and thick, as in the ordinary otters. The ground-tint of the
fur is a light grey: this is diversified by a black or dark brown stripe
that runs down the centre of the back, and expands over the shoulders,
loins, and hindquarters into saddle-shaped patches or bands of the same
dark hue.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BANDED ANT-EATER.

From an anatomical point of view, this is one of the most remarkable of the
pouched mammals.]

The COMMON or VIRGINIAN OPOSSUM, while the only representative of the
Marsupial Order found in the temperate latitudes of the North American
Continent, has a very considerable range of distribution, occurring in
equal abundance throughout the tropical regions of South America. In these
warmer latitudes it differs to such an extent in the character of its fur
and other minor points that it was for some time regarded as a distinct
species, and was distinguished by the title of the CRAB-EATING OPOSSUM.
Biologists are, however, now agreed that the supposed species is only a
local variety. As a matter of fact, a very considerable amount of variation
in the colour and markings is found to exist among the individuals of the
most familiarly known northern race. In form the animal may be suitably
compared to a huge rat, nearly equalling a cat in size, with an abnormally
large head and pointed snout. The tail is long, almost naked for the
greater portion of its length, and pre-eminently prehensile. The fur is of
a mixed character, consisting of an undergrowth of a fine, close, woolly
texture, through which protrudes a less dense series of long bristle-like
hairs. The colour of the fur ranges from black to white, and includes all
varieties of intermixture. The face, more especially in the northern race,
is usually much the lightest or altogether white, while in the tropical
South American examples it is more often darker, or it may be completely
black.

The opossum, like the rat, is an omnivorous feeder; and being of so much
larger size, and possessing an insatiable appetite, constitutes itself a
veritable pest to the fruit-grower, the agriculturist, and the
poultry-farmer. In effecting its entrance to hen-roosts or other
food-yielding enclosures, it exhibits an amount of cunning and pertinacity
possessed by no other mammal. Caught red-handed in these depredations, it
has recourse to stratagems which have won for it a reputation that has long
since passed into a household word. Feigning death, or "playing 'possum,"
is a game at which it is well known to be a past-master, but by which it
still frequently succeeds in hoodwinking the unwary, and so saves its skin.
Discovered thieving, and receiving perhaps a haphazard but by no means
disabling blow, it at once collapses, and with film-covered eyes and
protruding tongue is to all intents and purposes dead. It may be kicked
round the premises, and finally probably taken up by the tail and flung
ignominiously outside, without betraying vitality by even so much as a
wink. But no sooner is the coast thoroughly clear of the avenger than the
stiffened limbs relax, the eyes reopen, and Brer 'Possum trots off, as
fresh as ever. Maybe it is the ripening maize or the persimmon-patch that
next engages his attention, and in either case he walks in and feeds right
royally, laying up a goodly store of fat against the approaching winter
months of scarcity.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

YAPOCK, OR WATER-OPOSSUM.

In habits, although not in size and colour, this marsupial may be compared
to a wolf.]

Away from human habitations the opossum is an essentially arboreal animal,
living and breeding for the most part, like his Australian cousins, in
hollow trees, and making excursions therefrom in all directions in quest of
food. His much-mixed natural diet may consist of tender shoots and leaves,
and the wild grapes and the many other berries and fruits the forest
produces. He craves, however, after a due admixture of animal pabulum, and
birds and their eggs, insects, lizards, and the smaller mammals furnish
their quota to his menu. Crustacea, such as crabs and the crayfish which
abound in the American streams and marshes, have an irresistible attraction
for him; and it is on this account that, in the southern area of his
distribution, where these crustacea are so plentiful as to constitute his
main diet, and his face is browned by the more glowing sun, he is known by
the title of the Crab-eater.

Although fattening up against the winter, he, even in his most northern
limits, does not hibernate, but may even be seen leisurely picking his way
over the snow, probably tracking some unfortunate squirrel to its lair,
which in due time is located, dragged out, and devoured. While assimilating
his meal of flesh or fruit, Brer 'Possum likes to have all four hands at
liberty, his hind feet being also graspers; and so he twists his tail round
a convenient branch, and, hanging _perdu_, leisurely enjoys his feast. The
opossum, like the rat--to which it has in aspect and many of its habits
been likened--is a most prolific breeder, as many as from six to sixteen
young being comprised in the litter. When born, they are immediately
transferred to the somewhat capacious pouch, and remain there without
venturing outside until they are about the size of an ordinary mouse.

A third and very distinct type of American opossums is the one represented
on page 380, which, from its mouse-like size and aspect, is commonly known
as the MURINE OPOSSUM. The most distinct feature of this little animal is
that, though a genuine marsupial, it has no pouch, but carries its young on
its back, the little creatures twining their tails round that of their
mother, and so securing a stable anchorage. Although thus loaded up and
transformed for the time being into a sort of combination perambulator and
feeding-flask, the happy but anxious parent pursues the even tenor of her
way among the tree-branches and thicket-growths with almost unabated
agility. This species, in common with MERIAM'S OPOSSUM and the WOOLLY
OPOSSUM and several others which carry their young, to as many as a dozen
in number, on their backs, are denizens of tropical South America. One of
these, named the PHILANDER OPOSSUM, attains to the somewhat larger size of
about 2 feet in total length, the long prehensile tail representing,
however, the greater moiety of these dimensions.


THE SELVA.

South America has one other marsupial--the SELVA--an animal which, while
possessing the dimensions and much of the aspect of an ordinary rat, is
remarkable as differing so materially in the character of its teeth and
other structural points that it cannot be referred to any existing
marsupial family. On the other hand, this type is found to coincide in the
above particulars with species hitherto only known in the fossil state, and
excavated from the same tertiary deposits in Patagonia which have been
productive of the distant ally of the Tasmanian wolf. It is yet hoped by
zoologists that the discovery of other interesting and possibly some
supposed extinct mammals may reward the thorough exploration of the vast
South American forests. The capture in the flesh of some form allied to the
huge ground-sloths, such as the Mylodon and Megatherium, is, however, now
considered to be quite beyond the pale of possibility.

This is an interesting photograph, as it is reproduced life-size, and gives
an excellent idea of the animal in its native land.]


MONOTREMES, OR EGG-LAYING MAMMALS.

With this group or order of the Mammalian Class we arrive, as it were, on
the borderland between the mere typical Mammals and Reptiles. In the last
group, that of the Marsupials, it was observed that the young were brought
into the world at an abnormally early and helpless phase of their
existence, and usually consigned, until able to see and walk, to a
variously modified protective pouch. With the Monotremes a yet lower rung
in the evolutional ladder is reached, and we find that the young are
brought into the outer world as eggs, these being in the one case deposited
in a nest or burrow, and in the other carried about by the parent in a
rudimentary sort of pouch until they are hatched.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

WOOLLY AMERICAN OPOSSUM.

This animal is about the size of a large mouse. It carries its young on its
back, their tails being entwined round that of their parent.]

The living representatives of this singular mammalian order are but few in
number, being restricted, in point of fact, to only two distinctly
differentiated family types--the Echidna or Porcupine Ant-eater, and the
Platypus. These monotremes, moreover, like the majority of the existing
marsupials, are limited in their distribution to the Australasian region.
The single species of the Platypus is only found in Tasmania and the
southern and eastern districts of the Australian Continent, while the
Echidna numbers some three recognised species, two of which belong to
Australia and Tasmania and the third to New Guinea.


THE ECHIDNA.

The ECHIDNA, PORCUPINE ANT-EATER, or "PORCUPINE," as it is commonly called
by the Australian colonists, would seem at first sight to represent an
animal in which the characters of the hedgehog and the common porcupine are
interblended, the innumerable spines being longer than those of the former,
but less in length than those of the last-named animal. The head, with no
externally visible ears and remarkable elongated beak-like snout, however,
at once proclaims it to be altogether distinct from these. The animal has
no teeth, and the tiny mouth at the termination of the beak-like snout
simply constitutes an aperture for the extrusion of the worm-like glutinous
tongue, wherewith, after the manner of the true ant-eaters, it licks up the
inhabitants of the ants' nests upon which it feeds. For tearing down the
ants' nests and obtaining its customary food, as also for its inveterate
burrowing propensity, the feet, and more especially the front ones, are
provided with strong, blunt, and very powerful claws. The male animal is in
addition armed on the hind feet with a peculiar supplementary spur, which
is, however, still more conspicuously developed in the platypus.

Three distinct species of the echidna are recognised by zoologists. The one
peculiar to the cooler climate of Tasmania is remarkable for its more
slender spines, the much greater abundance of the long bristle-like hairs,
and the thickness of the seal-brown under-fur, as compared with the typical
Australian form. In North-west New Guinea the largest and most aberrant
form is met with. Normally it has only three toes in place of five to each
foot, the spines are very long and thick, the body is deeper and more
compressed, and the animal stands comparatively high upon its feet.

The writer, during his residence in Tasmania, had several examples of the
local species as domestic pets. For the first few days they were very shy
and untractable, burrowing into the earth and seeking to escape, or
presenting an impenetrable _cheval de frise_ of sharp-pointed spines to the
hands that sought to caress them. After a short interval, however, the
creatures became entirely reconciled to human society and the small amount
of restraint to which they were subjected. They would follow their owner
about the garden, or, flattening their bodies and spreading out their limbs
to the greatest extent, lie basking in the sun close to where he might be
seated. They also apparently appreciated being carried, slung across their
owner's arm after the manner of a lap-dog. Living in the near vicinity of
unreclaimed bush-land, it was found possible to keep these echidnas well
supplied with their customary food; they were, in fact, permitted to forage
on their own account. Liberated amidst their normal surroundings, they
would walk leisurely from one ant-hill to another, tearing down the side of
it with their powerful front claws, and appropriating its living contents
with the greatest relish. It was observed, however, in this connection that
the echidna paid attention entirely to the succulent white larvæ and pupal
phases of the insects with which the inner chambers of the ant-hills are
customarily crowded, and that adult ants, as they abounded in the tracts
near at hand or elsewhere, were altogether neglected. In addition to this
natural food these animals were supplied daily with a saucer of either
well-softened bread or porridge and milk, for which they evinced a decided
appreciation, assimilating this food dexterously, though somewhat slowly,
with the aid of their long protrusile tongues. Allowed to wander about the
house, they displayed a most inquisitive turn of mind, peering into every
crevice, and climbing upon every accessible article of furniture.

The echidna usually produces only one egg at a time; it is relatively
small, not larger than a sparrow's egg, but equally and obtusely rounded at
both extremities, and with a white leathery shell like that of a reptile.
For some time previous to hatching, this egg is carried in a skin-fold or
rudimentary pouch in the parent's abdomen, much similar to that possessed
by many of the marsupials. The young one is also retained in this pouch for
some weeks after escaping from the egg. When finally leaving the pouch, it
is between three and four inches in length, and the spines are in an
altogether rudimentary condition.

Examples of the Australian echidna have on several occasions been "in
residence" at the Zoo; while the Hon. Walter Rothschild has been fortunate
in keeping living specimens of both this and the very rare three-toed New
Guinea variety in his admirably appointed menagerie at Tring.

COMMON OR VIRGINIAN OPOSSUM.

The only marsupial animal found north of Mexico.]


THE PLATYPUS.

The egg-laying mammal known as the DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS differs very
essentially from the echidna both in aspect and habits. It is adapted
especially for an amphibious life, and for feeding on molluscs, worms, and
insects, which it abstracts from the muddy bed or banks of the rivers that
it frequents. The somewhat depressed ovate body is covered with short dense
fur much resembling in colour and texture that of an otter. The tail is
short and flattened like that of a beaver, but in place of being naked and
scaly, as in that animal, is covered, on the upper surface more
particularly, with long, coarse, bristle-like hairs that intercross one
another in all directions. Neither is this tail used, as with the beaver,
as a mason's trowel, it being simply subservient as a steer-oar. The feet
are all four distinctly webbed, the membranes of the front feet in
particular projecting to some distance beyond the extremities of the claws,
and so communicating to these members a singular resemblance to the feet of
a duck. The head of the platypus tapers off from the body without any
conspicuous neck, and terminates in a most remarkable duck-like beak,
having at its base a supplementary membranous ferrule-like structure which
would seem to serve the purpose of limiting the distance into which the
beak of the animal is thrust into the mud during the quest for its
accustomed food, and at the same time protecting the creature's eyes. The
mouth of the adult platypus contains no teeth, simply a few horny plates;
but, singularly to relate, rudimentary teeth exist temporarily in the young
animals. These provisional teeth, moreover, correspond in a marked manner
with those of some ancient types of mammals which occur as fossils in the
tertiary deposits of North America. The platypus, with relation to the
obliteration of its teeth in the adult state, is regarded as a very
exceptionally modified form and not as the immediate prototype of the
ordinary mammals.

The platypus is found in Tasmania and in the south and eastern districts of
Australia only, being altogether unknown in the west and north. Being
especially shy and retiring, and to a large extent nocturnal in its habits,
it is not frequently seen even in districts where it may be rather
abundant. The animal excavates burrows of so great a length as from thirty
to fifty feet in the river-banks that it frequents, and at the extreme end
of these burrows it constructs a loose nest of weeds and root-fibres, which
it uses as its retreat, and also for the production of its eggs and young.
There are invariably two entrances to these burrows, the one being under
water, and the other usually opening into a tangle of brushwood at some
little distance from the water's edge. As many as from one to four eggs and
young may be produced at a time, but two is the more general number. From
the first it would appear that the eggs and young are deposited and nursed
in the nest, not being retained or carried about in a pouch, as observed of
the echidna.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

ECHIDNA, OR ANT-EATING PORCUPINE.

The female echidna can carry two eggs in her pouch, which in due course are
hatched by the heat of her body.]

The late Dr. George Bennett, of Sydney, New South Wales, has probably
placed on record the most detailed account of the ways and life-habits of
these remarkable animals, though it did not fall to him to solve the
much-vexed question as to whether or not they were oviparous. This
discovery, as applied also to the like phenomenon in the case of the
echidna, was the outcome within quite recent years of the researches of Mr.
Caldwell. After much indefatigable exploration, in which he was ably
assisted by the natives, Dr. Bennett obtained from the extremity of an
exceptionally long burrow a mother and pair of half-grown young. The young
ones survived several weeks, and proved most droll and interesting pets. In
playful habits they much resembled puppies, chasing and rolling one another
over, and pretending to bite with their toothless bills. They were also
much addicted to climbing every scalable article of furniture, including
even a tall book-case, which they would negotiate by "swarming" up behind
it as a sweep climbs a chimney, with their backs to the wall and their feet
against the back of the book-case. The sleeping and waking hours that both
these and other examples kept were observed to be very irregular; for while
usually most lively and disposed to ramble after it grew dusk, they would
at other times come out of their own accord in the daytime, or perhaps one
would ramble about while the other slept. When going to sleep, they would
roll themselves up in a perfect ball, the head, tail, and limbs being
closely folded over the abdomen.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

TASMANIAN ECHIDNA, OR PORCUPINE ANT-EATER.

This is the largest variety of the five-toed species; it grows to a length
of 20 inches, and has the fur so long as almost to conceal the spines.]

The food question appears to have presented almost insurmountable
difficulties so far against the permanent acclimatisation of these
interesting animals in any of our European zoological gardens. At the
Melbourne Zoo some considerable success was obtained by fencing off a small
pond abounding with insects and well-established water-plants for their
reception, and in this instance they had also the advantage of being
brought speedily and within a few hours of their capture to their new home.
For their long voyage to Europe the provision of an adequate quantity of
living insects or other aquatic organisms is a by no means easy task. They
have, however, been known to thrive on broken-up river-mussels for the
space of two or three weeks, and would probably have done so for a longer
period. This material might easily be stored for their use on board ship.

An incident concerning the natural predilections of the platypus that fell
within the writer's observation in Tasmania might also be utilised in their
experimental transportation. At the trout- and salmon-rearing establishment
on the river Plenty--of which the writer was at the time
superintendent--the platypuses proved to be most destructive to the spawn
both deposited in the hatching-boxes and upon the natural spawning-beds, or
"redds," and they had in consequence to be systematically destroyed. This
being the case, it is probable that they would be found to thrive well on a
diet consisting to a large extent of the preserved roes or spawn of any
easily procurable fish--such as the Murray perch and cod--and of which
adequate supplies might with facility be stored aboard ship. The admixture
in all cases of a certain amount of sand or mud with their provided pabulum
would appear to be essential for digestive purposes, such material being
always found in considerable quantities in their stomachs when dissected.

A distinguishing feature which the male platypus shares in common with the
echidna is the peculiar spur developed on its hind foot. It is in this
case, however, much larger and sharper, and has been accredited with
aggressive functions and poisonous properties. There can be little doubt,
however, that they are normally used by the animal only as clasping or
retaining instruments during intercourse with the female at the
breeding-season. At the same time, undoubted cases of persons receiving
severe wounds from these animals' spurs have been placed on record. One
such that fell within the writer's cognisance happened on the Murray River,
on the Victorian and New South Wales boundary. A young fisher-lad, on
taking up his nets, found a half-drowned platypus entangled in them, and,
whilst disengaging it, it convulsively gripped his hand between the two
spurs, the points penetrating deeply into the flesh on either side. The
result was a festering wound that refused to heal for many months, and for
such time entirely deprived the lad of his use of that hand.

DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS.

This curious egg-laying mammal, the only representative of its family, is
mainly nocturnal in habits.]

The fur of the platypus, dressed so as to remove the outer and longer
series of hairs, nearly resembles that of the fur-seal in both colour and
texture, and as a rare local product is highly prized for the manufacture
of carriage-rugs and other articles.



With the egg-laying Echidna and Platypus we terminate the Mammalian Series,
and they pave the way to the typical egg-laying animals which follow.

Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

CHAPTER I.

_THE OSTRICH AND ITS KINDRED._


The Ostriches are a very ancient group of birds, and, judging from what we
know of their anatomy, they must be regarded as representing the most
primitive of living birds. With the exception of a single group, to be
discussed presently, all have lost the power of flight. In some, in
consequence, the wing has become reduced to a mere vestige. It is a rule in
Nature, we may remark, that whenever an organ, such as a wing or a leg or a
tail, ceases to be useful, it undergoes forthwith a slow process of
reduction or degeneration, growing smaller and smaller in each successive
generation, till at last it may even disappear altogether. The loss of
flight has been accompanied by a degeneration in the quality of the
feathers--that is to say, their serviceability as aids to flight has been
entirely lost.

RUFOUS TINAMOU, BRAZIL.

The tail-feathers of these birds are so small as to appear to be wanting.]

The size of the members of this group varies much. The largest of all is
the African Ostrich; the smallest, of the flightless forms, the New Zealand
Apteryx. The ostrich-like birds which have retained the power of flight are
known as Tinamous, and are natives of South America. All these are smaller
than the flightless Apteryx.

RHEA AND YOUNG.

Although the wings of the rhea are large, they fit so closely to the body
as to be invisible when closed.]


TINAMOUS.

The TINAMOUS should perhaps be regarded as standing at the head of the
Ostrich Tribe, since they have reached a higher degree of development than
any other of its members. They have also preserved the power of flight. In
their general appearance they bear a singular resemblance to partridges,
though a little careful observation will reveal many points wherein they
differ therefrom. They are very confiding and unsuspicious birds--some
persons call them stupid on this account--and in the early morning the
species inhabiting the Argentine pampas will, observers tell us, come right
up to the isolated houses of the settlers, so that the boys knock them down
with stones. The delicate quality of the flesh has caused these birds to be
highly esteemed as food, and their trustful nature renders them an easy
prey, so much so that in some districts they have been almost exterminated.
Large numbers are caught by riding round them in a circle and securing them
with a noose. Mr. Hudson, who lived many years in the pampas, assures us
that the GREAT TINAMOU is one of the sweetest-voiced of the native birds.
The song is composed of "five modulated notes, flute-like in character, and
very expressive, and is uttered by many individuals answering each other as
they sit far apart, concealed in the grass."

The eggs of the tinamous are to be reckoned among the wonders of bird life,
being so highly burnished as to look like beautifully glazed porcelain. The
colour varies according to the species, ranging from wine-red, blue-green,
and brown to black. The young are almost as remarkable as the eggs, being
clothed with a peculiar down, of great complexity of structure, and
resembling in some respects the nestling down of the true ostrich.


THE RHEA.

[Illustration: _Photo by H. Noble, Esq._]     [_Henley._

RHEA AND YOUNG ONES.

Although frequently bred in this country, the young do not seem to be
easily reared.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

RHEA LYING DOWN.

The breast of the larger members of the Ostrich Tribe is provided with a
large horny plate, on which they support the body when resting.]

The RHEA is a native of South America. It is frequently referred to as the
SOUTH AMERICAN OSTRICH, and also as the NANDU. The resemblance which it
bears to the true ostrich is striking, but it may at once be distinguished
therefrom by the fact that it has three toes and a feathered head and neck;
furthermore, it is smaller in size, and lacks the conspicuous white wing-
and tail-plumes. The tail, indeed, as may be seen from the photographs
reproduced is wanting. The rhea must be regarded as standing at the head of
the flightless members of the Ostrich Tribe. Its wings, though not large
enough to raise its heavy body from the ground, are yet of considerable
size.

In Buenos Aires rheas are hunted with dogs. If a breeze is blowing, the
birds raise one wing, which acts as a sail. This done, they can acquire a
speed which makes it absolutely impossible for either dog or horse to come
up with them. The only chance of ultimately capturing them is by wearing
them out by ceaseless pursuit. A chase of this kind may last an hour and a
half. Needless to say, for sport of this kind both horses and dogs must be
the best of their kind and in "good form." The natives and Indians hunt
them on horseback with the "bolas." The bolas, or balls, used for this
purpose consist of two round stones covered with leather, and united by a
thong of about 8 feet long. One of these is held in the hand and the other
whirled round the head and suddenly released, when both go whirling madly
round till they strike the rhea's legs, around which they instantly twist,
and the victim is a fast prisoner.

The rhea is in danger of disappearing altogether as a wild bird, owing to
the ruthless slaughter which is made upon it for the sake of its feathers.
For some years back, Mr. Harting tells us, "the number of birds killed has
averaged 400,000 per annum, and, as a consequence, the species has already
disappeared from nearly half the territory of the River Plate." On some
estates in Argentina the wild birds are driven in and plucked.

Like most of the Ostrich Tribe, the male alone performs the duties of
incubation, hatching some twenty eggs at a time, the produce of several
different females. There are three different kinds of rhea, but they do not
differ much one from another. The young are curiously striped. The egg is
very large, of a cream colour, and deeply pitted.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

RHEAS IN TRING PARK.

In spite of its large size, the rhea is not a conspicuous bird in a wild
state, the grey plumage harmonising perfectly with the surrounding pampas.]

Darwin, in his "Voyage of the Beagle," tells us that when he was "at Bahia
Blanca, in the months of September and October, the eggs, in extraordinary
numbers, were found all over the country. They lie either scattered and
single, in which case they are never hatched, and are called by the
Spaniards huachos; or they are collected together into a shallow excavation
which forms the nest. Out of the four nests which I saw, three contained
twenty-two eggs each, and the fourth twenty-seven. In one day's hunting on
horseback sixty-four eggs were found: forty-four of these were in two
nests, and the remaining twenty scattered huachos. The Gauchos unanimously
affirm--and there is no reason to doubt their statement--that the male bird
alone hatches the eggs, and for some time afterwards accompanies the young.
The cock, when on the nest, lies very close: I have myself almost ridden
over one. It is asserted that at such times they are occasionally fierce
and even dangerous, and that they have been known to attack a man on
horseback, trying to kick and leap on him. My informer pointed out to me an
old man whom he had seen much terrified by one chasing him.... I understand
that the male emu in the Zoological Gardens takes charge of the nest: this
habit, therefore, is common to the family.

WHITE RHEAS.

These are only varieties of the common form, not a distinct breed.]

"The Gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest. I
have been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched to
go, in the middle of the day, one after another, to the same nest....
Although this habit at first appears very strange, I think the cause may be
explained in a simple manner. The number of eggs in the nest varies from
twenty to forty, and even fifty; and according to Azara even seventy or
eighty. Now, although it is most probable, from the number of the eggs
found in one district being so extraordinarily great in proportion to the
parent birds, and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen, that
she may, in the course of the season, lay a large number, yet the time
required must be very long.... If the hen was obliged to hatch her own eggs
before the last was laid, the first probably would be addled; but if each
laid a few eggs at successive periods in different nests, and several hens
... combined together, then the eggs in one collection would be nearly of
the same age. If the number of eggs in one of these nests is, as I believe,
not greater on an average than the number laid by one female in the season,
then there must be as many nests as females, and each cock bird will have
its fair share of the labour of incubation; and that during a period when
the females probably could not sit, from not having finished laying. I have
before mentioned the great number of huachos, or deserted eggs; and that in
one day's hunting twenty were found in this state. It appears odd that so
many should be wasted. Does it not arise from the difficulty of several
females associating together, and finding a male ready to undertake the
office of incubation? It is obvious that there must at first be some degree
of association between at least two females, otherwise the eggs would
remain scattered over the wide plains, at distances far too great to allow
of the male collecting them into one nest: some ... have believed that the
scattered eggs were deposited for the young birds to feed on. This can
hardly be the case ... because huachos, although often found addled and
putrid, are generally whole."


THE OSTRICH.

The OSTRICH is the giant amongst living birds, the full-grown male standing
some 8 feet high, and weighing about 300 lbs. It is flightless, the wings
being smaller, in proportion to the size of the body, than in the rhea. But
the energy which in other birds is employed in sustaining flight in the
ostrich is expended in running, so that it has reached a high degree of
speed--no less, in fact, than twenty-six miles an hour. When at full speed,
it is generally believed the ostrich derives no small help from the wings,
which are used sail-wise. Nor is this belief by any means a modern one, for
all of us must be familiar with Job's observations on this subject: "What
time she lifteth up her wings on high, she scorneth the horse and his
rider." The wings are never used in running at full speed, but are of much
service in turning, "enabling the bird to double abruptly, even when going
at top speed." In justice to the older observers, however, it must be
remarked that ostriches do run with raised wings, but only at the
commencement of the run, or in covering a short distance, when the pace may
be considerable; but if circumstances demand "full speed ahead," they are
held close to the body, where they offer the least resistance to speed.

OSTRICH STANDING BESIDE HER EGGS.

In a wild state both cock and hen take part in the preparation of the
nest.]

With the gradual perfection of its running powers, there has followed a
gradual change in the form of the leg. This change has taken place by
reduction in the number of the toes. Of the original five with which its
ancestors began life only two now remain--the third and fourth. The third
is of great size, having apparently waxed great at the expense of the other
toes, a growth which seems to be still in progress, inasmuch as the fourth
toe is undoubtedly dwindling. It is very small, and gives unmistakable
signs of growing smaller, since it has now become nailless. When it has
quite disappeared, the ostrich, like the horse, will have but a single toe
on each foot--the third. The dainty, mincing step of the ostrich is a
delight to watch, and, thanks to the Zoological Gardens, this can be done
even in smoky London.

The ostrich, like its cousin of South America, the rhea, commonly
associates with herds of the larger mammalia. On the South African veldt
the companions of the ostrich are the zebra, wildebeest, and hartebeest,
just as on the pampas of South America the rheas are found associated with
herds of deer and guanaco.

The egg of the ostrich weighs about 3 lbs., and is of delicious flavour.
The empty shell, it has been found by experiment, is large enough to hold
the contents of eighteen eggs of the common domesticated fowl. It takes
about forty minutes to boil an ostrich egg hard. About fifteen eggs
represent the clutch. The nest is a mere depression in the sand. The hen
sits by day, and her mate by night; but the eggs are _never_ left, as is
sometimes stated, to the heat of the sun, so as to lessen the duties of the
parent. Such a course would infallibly destroy the eggs, for the sun's
rays, especially at noon, are very powerful.

The male and female ostrich differ much in coloration. In the former the
trunk is clothed in a vestment of richest black, whilst the quills of the
wings and tail-feathers are of pure white: they form the much-prized
ostrich plumes. The female is much less splendid, being clothed in sober
grey. But these colours are not merely ornamental; they render the male by
night and the female by day invisible, owing to the perfect harmony they
make with their surroundings, thus affording an interesting illustration of
protective coloration.

"All ostriches," says Mr. Cronwright Schreiner, "adults as well as chicks,
have a strange habit known as 'waltzing.' When chicks are let out from a
kraal in the early morning, they will often start away at a great pace.
After running for a few hundred yards they will all stop, and, with wings
raised, spin round rapidly for some time, often till quite giddy, when a
broken leg occasionally occurs. Adult birds, when running in large camps,
will often, if the veldt is good, do the same, especially if startled in
the fresh of the early morning. A troop of birds waltzing, in full plumage,
is a remarkably pretty sight. Vicious cocks 'roll' when challenging to
fight, also when wooing the hen. The cock will suddenly bump down on to his
'knees' ... open his wings, making a straight line across his breast, and
then swing them alternately backwards and forwards ... as if on a pivot,
each wing, as it comes forward, being raised, while that going backward is
depressed. The neck is lowered until the head is on a level with the back,
and the head and neck swing from side to side with the wings, the back of
the head striking with a loud click against the ribs, first on the one side
and then on the other. The click is produced by the skin of the neck, which
then bulges loosely just under the beak and for some distance downwards.
While 'rolling,' every feather over the whole body is on end, and the
plumes are open, like a large white fan. At such a time the bird sees very
imperfectly, if at all; in fact, he seems so preoccupied that, if pursued,
one may often approach unnoticed. I have walked up to a 'rolling' cock and
seized him by the neck, much to his surprise. Just before rolling, a cock,
especially if courting the hen, will often run slowly and daintily on the
points of his toes, with neck slightly inflated, upright and rigid, the
tail half drooped, and all his body-feathers fluffed up; the wings raised
and expanded, the inside edges touching the sides of the neck for nearly
the whole of its length, and the plumes showing separately, like an open
fan ... on each side of his head. In no other attitude is the splendid
beauty of his plumage displayed to such advantage."

OSTRICHES TEN DAYS OLD.

The down-feathers of young ostriches are quite different from those of
other birds, the tips of each being produced into a horny ribbon.]

The males are very fierce while guarding their eggs or fighting for mates,
and kick with extraordinary violence with their powerful legs. As an
example of their fierceness when aroused, Mr. Cronwright Schreiner, who
knows much of these birds, relates a story, told him by a railway-guard, of
an old male who charged a goods-train coming at full speed down a steep
gradient. The bird, as soon as he caught sight of the train, at once got on
the line, "and advanced fearlessly to fight the monster. As the screeching
engine approached, he rushed at it from straight in front, hissing angrily,
and kicked. He was cut to pieces the next moment."

[Illustration: _Photo by Mr. Glenday_]     [_Cape Town._

AN OSTRICH FAMILY.

The cock bird is an unusually fine specimen, measuring exactly 8 feet from
head to foot.]

The Bedouin tribes hunt the ostrich on dromedaries, so also do the natives
of Somaliland, and when near enough shoot it with poisoned arrows. In the
Sahara, Canon Tristram tells us it is ridden down on horseback, a method of
capture which the Sahara sportsman regards as the greatest feat of hunting.

"The Bushmen," says Mr. Harting, "like the Somalis, kill the ostrich with
poisoned arrows, or catch it very cleverly in pit-falls or with the lasso,
and the Sukurieh and Hadendawah tribes likewise use the lasso, with which
the bird, when once fairly caught, is strangled.... A favourite plan is to
wait for the birds in a place of concealment, as near as possible to the
pools to which they come for water, and then, with a gun loaded with
swan-shot, to fire at their necks as they stoop to drink, when perhaps half
a dozen are laid low at once.... Another plan to which the Bushman often
resorts is simpler still. Having found an ostrich's nest, he removes all
the eggs, and, ensconcing himself in the nest, quietly awaits the return of
the bird, which he shoots with a poisoned arrow before it has time to
recover from its surprise at finding him there instead of the eggs.... In
Senaar the Abû-Rôf bring it down by throwing a curved flat stick from 2½ to
3 feet long, not unlike the Australian boomerang, and made of tough
acacia-wood or hard zizyphus."

A GROUP OF COCK OSTRICHES.

Note the conspicuous tail in these birds; it is wanting in other members of
the Ostrich Tribe.]

Mr. Arthur Glynn, of Leydenburg, gives a graphic description of an ostrich
hunt, his quarry being a troop of twenty birds--"on sighting which," he
tells us, "we immediately gave chase, discovering directly afterwards that
a single bull wildebeeste was among them. After a stiff gallop," he says,
"of half a mile, we got within seventy yards of the troop; so reining in,
we both dismounted and fired, bringing down one ostrich and the wildebeeste
bull.... We quickly mounted and continued the pursuit, the ostriches never
running for any distance in a direct course, but always turning and
twisting, which made it difficult for us to keep them in sight.... We went
sailing on, neck and neck, regardless of holes or anything else, only
thinking of the grandly plumaged birds in front of us, our horses straining
every nerve to overtake them, as only old stagers know how to run when in
pursuit of game. We had now approached within fifty yards, and, jumping
down, we fired at two cock birds running separately from the troop,
bringing them both down. Hastily mounting, we continued on after the
retreating troop; but at this juncture my friend's horse trod in a hole,
sending his rider over his head, thereby completely putting him out of the
run. I now continued the chase by myself. For a mile the ostriches gained
on me, as they continued to run in a straight line, thereby not enabling me
to cut off any point, but obliging me to keep in their rear all the
time.... I got off twice, and fired several fruitless shots, and then
continued the chase for certainly two miles without dismounting once.... I
now got within a hundred yards, and jumped down.... The first shot I fired
brought down a fine cock bird, but the second struck the ground over the
others, turning them to the right along a low ridge. They appeared very
much exhausted, and ran with their wings spread out.... I saw that they
were coming direct for me, and waited until they were close.... When the
ostriches approached within fifteen yards, I selected the best-looking
bird, and put a bullet through him. He ran on for about twenty yards and
fell dead."

SCLATER'S CASSOWARY.

This bird is not yet full grown, the horny casque on the top of the head
being much larger in the adult.]


CASSOWARIES AND EMEUS.

With the Cassowaries and Emeus we have come as near as we can get at the
present day to the representatives of the ancient type from which the
Ostrich Tribe have sprung. But both these forms are to be regarded as
having passed the prime of their development, for, like their allies which
we have already considered, they have lost the power of flight. Both emeu
and cassowary possess, when adult, one character shared by no other living
adult bird: they have what may be called double feathers, each feather
possessing two shafts of equal length. They appear to follow a custom of
their own in the matter of the coloration of their eggs, since these are
never white, like those of the rhea or ostrich, but green, with a very
rough surface. The young, like those of the rhea, are striped with
alternate black and white stripes. The emeu is found only on the continent
of Australia; the cassowary occurs both in Australia and on the
neighbouring islands of New Guinea, Ceram, and Aru.

The lot of the CASSOWARY appears to have been cast in pleasant places,
making it possible to indulge in the luxury of personal decoration--a
decoration, moreover, shared equally by the males and females, both sexes
having the head and neck most brilliantly coloured. In some species all the
hues of the rainbow are vividly reflected. To show these colours, the
feathery covering, still worn by their relatives on the distant continents
of Africa and America, has been cast off and the skin left bare. To these
gorgeous hues they have added yet other features, for the head is
surmounted in many species by a huge casque, or helmet; whilst from the
neck depend curious fleshy lobes, or wattles, coloured in accordance with
the rest of the bare, coloured skin of this region. Then, too, they have
effected quite a novel transformation in the quills of the wing, for these
project on either side of the body in a series of shining black spines. Nor
is this all, for over and above the energy which they have to spare for
personal decoration is a very large reserve to be expended in fighting. The
males are very pugnacious, and to give point to this pugnacity they wear a
very formidable weapon on the inner toe in the shape of a huge nail, which
can inflict a really dangerous wound. It is used in kicking, the foot being
brought forwards and downwards with incredible speed and great force. When
wounded, these powerful birds are very dangerous to approach. "On more than
one occasion a wounded bird has caused a naturalist to take to a tree. The
sharp nail of the inner toe is a most dangerous weapon, quite equal to the
claw of a large kangaroo, and capable of doing quite as much execution."

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

NEST AND EGGS OF EMEU.

The feet of the old bird, which was standing near, can be seen behind the
eggs.]

Although forest-haunting birds--wherein they differ from their allies,
which are plain-dwellers--the cassowaries are adepts at swimming. There is
a danger that these beautiful and interesting birds will slowly be
exterminated by greedy and thoughtless settlers. The Australian cassowary
is already decreasing sadly, being persecuted for the sake of its skin,
which is used for rugs and doormats.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

YOUNG EMEUS FIVE DAYS OLD.

Young emeus just out of the shell have the legs beautifully spotted, but
these spots are rapidly lost.]

The EMEU, though a sort of cousin of the cassowary, boasts none of its
splendour; on the contrary, it is a dull, dowdy-looking bird. In size,
however, it is much larger than the cassowary. The wings, which are
exceedingly small, have numerous tiny quill-feathers--not long, hard
spines, as in the cassowary. When in captivity, it exhibits great
curiosity; furthermore, it is swift to realise symptoms of fear in the
faces of any visitor whom it may have under inspection. Occasionally fear
turns into flight, and then, thoroughly entering into the joke, the emeu
pursues at top speed. Needless to say, hunting of this kind can only be
done in fairly large paddocks or parks; but emeus are frequently so kept.

A very remarkable and quite unique structure in the emeu is a curious bag
or pouch, formed by a sort of out-pocketing of the inner lining of the
windpipe. Emerging through a long slit caused by the incompleteness of some
of the rings near the middle of the windpipe, the pouch comes to lie
between this tube and the skin. Strangely enough, it is found only in the
female, and is used by her chiefly during the breeding-season, when she
utters a peculiarly loud booming note, which, it is supposed, is caused by
the manipulation of the air in the pouch. When moved by any gentle
excitement or pleasure, especially on damp evenings or in the dead of
night, she also becomes musical, giving forth a note which has been likened
to a gong or muffled drum. The male, which is smaller, fleeter of foot, and
more docile and inquisitive, is mute, or at most gives forth a suppressed
hiss when angry, or a kind of grunt when distressed.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

YOUNG EMEUS.

After a few weeks the black and white stripes become much less
conspicuous.]

At one time the emeu roamed over the whole of the mainland of Australia;
but now, alas! it is almost exterminated, being found only far inland and
in steadily diminishing numbers. Swift of foot and of great powers of
endurance, the emeu has afforded in the past much "sport" to the
hunting-man, who followed the dogs, doubtless making comparisons the while
between his two-legged prey and his four-footed friend Reynard. The hunt
does not end till the bird is thoroughly exhausted, when it must be seized
at once by the neck, in order to prevent it kicking, for the legs are so
powerful that a blow from the foot is dangerous.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

EMEU.

The feathers of the neck of the emeu are much longer than in the rhea;
hence the neck seems shorter.]

Incubation is apparently performed by the male, which sits from fifty-four
to sixty-four days. Practically no nest is made, only a shallow hollow
being scraped in the sand. The eggs, from seven to thirteen in number, are
of a dark bottle-green colour, sometimes lighter, and have the surfaces
curiously roughened. The male is smaller than the female, a fact which has
led to some confusion, the larger female having at one time been regarded
as the male. It will be noted that the emeus not only lack the brilliant
colour of the cassowaries, but also the helmet, or casque.

The late Mr. Gould's remarks on the edibility of the emeu are interesting.
He says: "Its flesh has been compared to coarse beef, which it resembles,
according to Mr. Cunningham, both in appearance and taste, and is good and
sweet eating; nothing, indeed, can be more delicate than the flesh of the
young ones. There is little fit for culinary use upon any part of the emu,
except the hindquarters, which are of such dimensions that the shouldering
of the two hind legs homeward for a mile distance once proved to me as
tiresome a task as I ever recollect to have encountered in the colony. I
may remark that its flesh proved of the greatest service to Dr. Leichardt
and his intrepid companions during their overland route from Moreton Bay to
Port Essington, in the course of which, but more particularly between the
head of the Gulf of Carpentaria and Port Essington, the sight and capture
of the emu was almost a daily occurrence; so abundant, in fact, was it,
that he states that he saw in the short space of eight miles at least a
hundred, in flocks of three, five, ten, and even more at a time. On the
continent of Australia the emu was formerly abundant about Botany Bay and
Port Jackson Harbour, but is now only to be seen in the plains of the
interior, over whose solitudes it roams in great numbers, and where it
breeds, depending on the strength and swiftness of its legs to avoid the
pursuit of the stockmen and their dogs. Farther and farther back, however,
will it be driven, until it be extirpated, unless some law be instituted to
check its wanton destruction."

MANTELL'S KIWI, NEW ZEALAND, NORTH ISLAND.

When feeding, the kiwi makes a sniffing sound, distinctly audible at some
distance.]

In a wild state emeus take readily to the water, and have on more than one
occasion been seen swimming across a wide river. The South American rhea is
also known to be a good swimmer.

The COMMON EMEU is restricted to Eastern Australia. The opposite side of
this great continent is inhabited by another and very distinct species,
known as the SPOTTED EMEU.


THE APTERYX.

To see the APTERYX at home, we should have to travel to far New Zealand,
and to hunt with infinite patience when we got there. Apteryx-hunting, it
has been found, to be successful, must be done by the help of dogs. Sir
Walter Buller has written some very spirited accounts of such hunts.
Europeans, indeed, have been singularly successful in this hunting, whereby
they have done much to enhance the value of this bird by hastening its fast
approaching and inevitable extermination.

[Illustration: _Photo by Robert D. Carson, Esq._]     [_Philadelphia._

OWEN'S KIWI, NEW ZEALAND, SOUTH ISLAND.

This is the smallest of the kiwis.]

The natives call this bird the Kiwi, from its call-note, "ki-i-wi." These
cries are uttered during the early hours of the night, ceasing after
midnight. They appear to have great penetrating power.

CHAPTER II.

_THE GAME-BIRDS AND RAILS._


It is not easy in a few words exactly to define a "game-bird." Anatomical
details aside, the most characteristic features are the small head and
moderately long neck, and a compact body, in which the wings, when folded,
are almost entirely concealed. The hind toe is always present, and the
claws are adapted for scratching purposes--that is to say, for scratching
up the surface of the ground in the search for seeds as food. The wings are
hollowed so as to fit close to the body, and the flight, which is noisy and
never long-sustained, is nevertheless often exceedingly rapid. The young
are hatched covered with down, and able to run in a few hours after birth.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

RED GROUSE.

This is one of the species in which the toes are feathered.]


GROUSE AND PTARMIGAN.

The birds of this group are distinguished by the feathery covering which
clothes the feet. In some grouse, however, the toes are bare. This causes
them to resemble the Pheasant group, from which they may be distinguished
by the fact that the toes are fringed with horny processes forming a sort
of comb.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

PTARMIGAN.

In winter these birds don a snow-white livery.]

The RED GROUSE is the only game-bird which is not found outside the British
Islands. It is the bird which perhaps heads the list in the estimation of
British sportsmen, who travel north in hundreds every year for the pleasure
of the sport it affords. It is furthermore remarkable for the wonderful
variety of the seasonal plumages. Both sexes change their dress twice
during the year--the female in spring and summer, and the male in autumn
and winter. Its Continental relative, the RYPER, has no less than three
changes--spring, summer, and winter. For the last season a white dress is
adopted, to correspond with its snowy surroundings. The winters in the
British Islands are neither long enough nor severe enough to render such
change necessary with the red grouse, which is sufficiently protected by
its ordinary dress.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

CAPERCALLIE.

This was once a common British bird. The present breed was introduced some
years ago, the native birds having been exterminated.]

The largest and perhaps the most interesting of all the European game-birds
are the CAPERCALLIES, or CAPERCAILZIES. The British species is also known
as the COCK-OF-THE-WOOD. He is a handsome black bird, nearly as big as a
turkey, weighing from 9 to 17 lbs.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

COMMON PARTRIDGE.

This is the commoner and more esteemed of the two species of British
partridges.]

In the spring the capercallie, like the blackcock, indulges in a remarkable
"love-song," or "play," as it is called. With outstretched neck, tail
expanded like a fan, drooping wings, and ruffled feathers, he commences his
call, "peller, peller, peller," increasing in rapidity every moment, till
he works himself up into a perfect frenzy. At this time he is perfectly
unconscious of all around him, and poachers, knowing this, sometimes take
advantage to creep up and shoot him. On hearing the cock, the hens assemble
from all parts of the forest. The male then descends from the tree to the
ground, when "he and his female friends join company" and march away. The
capercallie is jealous of trespassers on his domain, and instances are on
record where people have been attacked when so infringing.

Like the capercallie, the BLACKCOCK must be sought in the woods, whence he
sallies forth to the moors and stubble-fields to feed. The GREY-HEN, as the
female of this species is called, lays from six to ten eggs, of a buff
colour, spotted with rich brown: both in number and colour they resemble
those of the capercallie.

The naturalist Brehm gives a delightful account of the love-making of this
bird. During the spring, he says, "the bird utters almost continuously the
strangest noises. He holds his tail up and spreads it out like a fan, he
lifts up his head and neck with all the feathers erect, and stretches his
wings from the body. Then he takes a few jumps in different directions,
sometimes in a circle, and presses the under part of his beak so hard
against the ground that the chin-feathers are rubbed off. During these
movements he beats his wings and turns round and round. The more ardent he
grows, the more lively he becomes, until at last the bird appears like a
frantic creature. At such times the blackcocks are so absorbed that they
become almost blind and deaf, but less so than the capercallie."

North America is very rich in large forms of grouse; and one of the most
interesting of these is the PRAIRIE-HEN, remarkable for the possession of a
pair of curious bags of a bright orange colour on each side of the neck,
which can be inflated with air at will.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

TEXAN BOB-WHITE (ABOUT HALF NATURAL SIZE).

This bird takes its name from its note--"Ah-Bob-White."]

"Early in the morning," writes Captain Bendire of the prairie-hen, "you may
see them assemble in parties, from a dozen to fifty together, on some dry
knolls ... and their goings-on would make you laugh. The air-sacs are their
ornaments, which they display ... before the gentler sex by blowing them up
till they look like two ripe oranges ... projecting their long, black ears
right forward, ruffling up all the feathers of the body till they stand out
straight, and dropping their wings on the ground like a turkey-cock....
Then it is that the proud cock, in order to complete his triumph, will rush
forward at his best speed ... through the midst of the love-sick damsels,
pouring out as he goes a booming noise ... which may be heard for at least
two miles in the still morning air. Every few minutes this display is
repeated ... but they seem careful not to run against each other, for they
have not yet got to the fighting-point. After a little while the lady birds
begin to show an interest in the proceedings, by moving about quickly a few
yards at a time, and then standing still a short time. When these actions
are continued by a large number of birds at a time, it presents a funny
sight, and you can easily think they are moving to the measure of music."

GOLDEN PHEASANT.

This bird is often kept in aviaries, on account of its magnificent livery.]

GOLDEN PHEASANT.

This bird is moulting. In full dress the cape seen in the upper figure is
golden with blue-black bars.]

The prairie-hens of America possess great economic value, as great, indeed,
as the red grouse of the British Islands, enormous numbers of prairie-hens
being exported to Europe every year, whilst still greater numbers are
consumed by the American people themselves. It is said that American grouse
will sometimes eat the shoots of a plant called _kalmia_, which renders the
flesh poisonous.

The SAGE-GROUSE is a rather large bird, attaining a weight of 8 lbs., found
in the Western United States; it is, indeed, the largest of the American
grouse. Its courting habits resemble those of the prairie-hens. From the
book containing the above lively description we cull the following:--

blood-red.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

PEACOCK-PHEASANT.

These pheasants take their name from the eye-like spots on the wings.]

"Early one morning in the first week in March, 1877, I had the
long-wished-for opportunity to observe the actions of a single cock while
paying court to several females near him.... His large, pale yellow
air-sacs were fully inflated, and not only extended forward but apparently
upward as well, rising at least an inch above his head, which consequently
was scarcely noticeable, giving the bird an exceedingly peculiar
appearance. He looked decidedly top-heavy and ready to topple over on the
slightest provocation." He then proceeds to describe the further
preparations designed for conquest. The tail is spread fan-wise, and
animated with a peculiar quivering motion, whilst the wings are trailed
upon the ground. When the correct position has been assumed, he advances
with stately, hesitating steps towards his mate, uttering, as he moves,
"low, grunting, guttural sounds" resembling those of a purring cat, but
louder. This, apparently, is the prescribed method of courting; of many
suitors, he is selected who performs best.

TEMMINCK'S TRAGOPAN.

Tragopans are remarkable for a fleshy horn above each eye, not noticeable
save when the bird is excited.]

The RUFFED GROUSE, like the prairie-hen, has the neck, in the male,
ornamented with a frill of long feathers. Like many other birds, the
female, when danger, in the shape of prowling beasts, threatens her eggs or
young, simulates lameness. So soon as the enemy approaches near enough to
be dangerous, up she gets with a great noise of wings, and then flutters
along the ground as though wounded. The would-be captor is thus led far
from the jealously guarded treasures, and when a safe distance has been
covered an end is speedily put to this will-o'-the-wisp chase by the bird
suddenly taking wing.


PARTRIDGES, QUAILS, AND PHEASANTS.

The birds which come under this head are so many in number they may be
reckoned by the hundred, and include several forms of exquisite beauty. The
legs of many are armed with formidable spurs, with which the males, who are
exceedingly pugnacious, fight furiously with their rivals for the
possession of some coveted female.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

CHINESE TRAGOPAN.

The scarlet plumage of some of the Tragopans is most gorgeous.]

Of the more conspicuous forms we may mention the RED-LEGGED and COMMON
PARTRIDGES. In England the former is known more generally as the FRENCH
PARTRIDGE--why, it is hard to say. It is a native of South-eastern Europe,
whence it was introduced towards the end of the eighteenth century. It is a
handsome bird, but not in high favour with sportsmen, since it prefers to
escape by running rather than by flight.

The COMMON PARTRIDGE is the more abundant of the two species. Though more
sober in coloration, it is still a beautiful bird. The "horse-shoe" mark,
borne on the breast, so characteristic of this bird, is _not_ confined to
the males, as is generally believed. "Yielding," says Professor Newton,
"perhaps in economic importance to the red grouse, what may be called the
social influence of the partridge is greater than that excited by any other
wild bird."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

HIMALAYAN MONAL.

In some parts of India this bird has been exterminated, owing to the
demands of the plume-market.]

This bird displays great courage and affection in defence of its eggs or
young. A story illustrating this is told of a gentleman near Spilsby, in
Lincolnshire, who, "whilst superintending his ploughmen, saw a partridge
glide off her nest, so near the foot of one of his plough-horses that he
thought the eggs must be crushed; this, however, was not the case.... He
saw the old bird return to her nest the instant he left the spot. It was
evident that the next round of the plough must bury the eggs and nest in
the furrow. His surprise was great when, returning with the plough, he came
to the spot and saw the nest indeed, but the eggs and bird were gone. An
idea struck him that she had removed her eggs; and he found her, before he
left the field, sitting under the hedge upon twenty-one eggs.... The round
of ploughing had occupied about twenty minutes, in which time she, probably
aided by the cock bird, had removed the twenty-one eggs to a distance of
about forty yards."

The RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGES, their allies the FRANCOLINS, and the GREY
PARTRIDGES are all ground-birds; the TREE-PARTRIDGES, as the name implies,
are not, or at least less completely so--hence their mention here. They are
natives of the Indo-Chinese countries, and the islands of Java, Borneo, and
Formosa.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

HIMALAYAN MONAL.

The female of the monal is quite soberly clad.]

The QUAIL is a little-known British bird, very like a small partridge in
appearance. Enormous numbers, Professor Newton tells us, "are netted on the
Continent, especially in the spring migration. The captives are exposed in
the poulterers' shops, confined in long, cloth-covered cages, with a
feeding-trough in front." The bulk "of these are males, which are the first
to arrive, and advantage is taken of this circumstance by the
bird-catchers, who decoy hundreds into their nets by imitating the
call-note of the female. It has been stated that in the small island of
Capri, in the Bay of Naples, 160,000 have been netted in a single season,
and even larger numbers are on record." An idea of the vast numbers which
travel together in migration may be gathered from Canon Tristram's
statement that in Algeria, in April, he found the ground covered with
quails for an extent of many acres at daybreak, where on the preceding
afternoon not one was to be seen. These are the birds which were so eagerly
seized by the Israelites as a welcome change in the diet which had become
so monotonous in the days of their early wanderings. The story, so vividly
told in the Book of Exodus, is, of course, familiar to all.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

RED COCHINS.

The wings in the typical Cochins are so short as to be useless.]

The quail lays from nine to fifteen eggs in a feeble apology for a nest. It
is said that the curious metallic note "clic-lic-lic" gave origin to the
Spanish castanet, for these birds are much esteemed in Spain, being kept in
cages for the pleasure their notes afford.

There are five or six other species of quail closely related to the above.
The British bird enjoys an enormous range, being found almost everywhere in
Europe, Asia, and Africa. The so-called AMERICAN QUAILS--some forty species
in number--are generally regarded as belonging to a distinct group.

That ornament to all rural scenery, the PHEASANT, is said to have been
introduced from the banks of the river Phasis, in Colchis, Transcaucasia,
by the Romans--at least, the original form of pheasant was. Late during the
eighteenth century a Japanese and a Chinese form were introduced, and these
have freely interbred with the original form, so that pure-bred specimens
of any of the three are rare.

The speed of a pheasant on the wing in full flight has been estimated at
thirty-eight miles an hour. Occasionally pheasants will take to the water,
and are said to swim well.

The number of pheasants reared by hand at the present day is prodigious. In
1883, Professor Newton tells us, 134,000 pheasants' eggs were sold from one
estate in Norfolk, while 9,700 fully grown birds were killed upon it. In
olden times pheasants were taken in snares or nets, by hawking, and by the
cross-bow; but on the introduction of guns these methods were superseded.

Yet another form of pheasant has been introduced into Britain of late
years. This is REEVES'S PHEASANT, a truly magnificent bird, with a tail
fully 5 feet long in adult males. These birds also interbreed with the more
common forms, but not freely.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

BROWN LEGHORN COCK.

This breed has been derived by crossing White Leghorns with Game-fowl.]

Beautiful as these pheasants undoubtedly are, they are eclipsed by many of
their relatives. Among the most noteworthy of these we may notice the
magnificent TRAGOPANS. Rich in coloration of the feathers, these birds have
added an additional feature in brilliantly coloured areas of bare skin on
the head and neck, which are furthermore rendered conspicuous by being
developed with "horns" and wattles. These "horns" can be erected at will, a
process which causes them at the same time to be greatly increased in size.
The bird, with a proud consciousness of his beauty, displays his charms to
the full when wooing. Mr Bartlett tells us that, "after walking about
rather excitedly, he places himself in front of the female, with the body
slightly crouching upon the legs, and the tail bent downwards; the head is
then violently jerked downwards, and the horns and wattle become
conspicuous. The wings have a flapping motion, and the bright red patch on
them is fully displayed. The whole of the neck appears to be larger than
usual during this action, so do the horns, which, moreover, vibrate with
every motion. This scene is concluded by the bird suddenly drawing himself
up to his full height, with his wings expanded and quivering, the horns
erect, and the wattles fully displayed."

SILVER-SPANGLED HAMBURGS.

This bird apparently originated in England.]

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

DARK BRAMAS.

The Brama is an Asiatic breed.]

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

SILVER WYANDOTTE HEN WITH PHEASANT CHICKS.

This is an American breed, derived by crossing with the Brama.]

Equally splendid, some think more so, are the four species of pheasant
known as MONALS or IMPEYAN PHEASANTS. The plumage in this case looks like
burnished metal rather than feathers. The head is adorned with a crest
either of long or beautifully curled feathers. Monals are found in the same
haunts as the tragopans--the highest forest regions of the Himalaya.

But the most gorgeous of all the Pheasant Tribe are perhaps the GOLDEN
PHEASANTS. The crimson body and exquisitely beautiful collar of gold barred
with black constitute a perfectly royal livery. Since, however, these are
amongst the commonest occupants of the aviary, we need not describe them
further here. They are natives of China and Tibet.


JUNGLE-FOWL AND THEIR DOMESTICATED DESCENDANTS.

These birds, of which there are four distinct species, are close allies of
the domesticated fowls: the descent of these latter, indeed, is traced from
the red jungle-fowl of the Himalaya and Central India. The characteristic
features of the group are the naked head, bearing the familiar wattles and
fleshy comb, and the formidable spurs on the legs.

The varieties of the domesticated jungle-fowl are numerous. The pugnacity
of the members known as the GAME-BREED is well known, and in the days of
cock-fighting large sums of money changed hands over the fierce battles
waged by rival game-cocks pitted one against the other--the game-cock, it
should be remarked, being the little-modified descendant of the red
jungle-cock.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

PEACOCK.

Note the perfectly symmetrical distribution of the "eyes" in the "train."]

The modern game-cock is purely a show-bird, breeders having changed the
type by selecting characters which would render the bird quite unable to
hold its own if matched in battle with one of the original breed.

Very different from the wild ancestor is the huge, much-feathered COCHIN.
This was introduced into England, not from Cochin-China, as is popularly
supposed, but from Shanghai, some fifty years ago. At that time this bird
enjoyed the reputation of being wonderfully prolific. This is, alas! no
longer a feature of the breed. The show-pen is apparently responsible for
this, attention having been paid rather to external appearance than to
useful qualities.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

BACK VIEW OF PEACOCK.

Note the true tail, like a stout fan, supporting the train.]

The PLYMOUTH ROCK and DORKING are both well-known breeds. The former is of
American origin, made by crossing Cochins with a native breed--the
Dominique.

The BLACK SPANISH, MINORCAS, LEGHORNS, ANDALUSIANS, etc., constitute what
are known as the Mediterranean breeds. They are noted for their great
prolificacy. This has been gained by carefully breeding from the most
productive birds, but with the result that the instinct to sit has been
lost entirely. This is a matter of no consequence, however, as when chicks
are required there are plenty of "broody" hens of other breeds which can be
made to undertake the duties of foster-mother.

The HAMBURGS are of two kinds--the SPANGLED, which is of English, and the
PENCILLED, of Continental origin.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

BLACK-CHESTED CRESTED GUINEA-FOWL.

At Durban these birds are often hawked by Kaffir hunters, the flesh being
very delicate and much esteemed.]

A very old breed is the POLISH. It figures often in the pictures of the old
Dutch masters. One of its chief characteristics is the huge crest of
feathers rising from the crown of the head. The development of this crest
has had a very extraordinary effect upon the conformation of the bones of
the skull, entirely altering the shape of the brain-case.

Perhaps the most artificial of all breeds of fowl are the SEBRIGHT BANTAMS.
These are diminutive birds, the result of a cross between the Polish with
"laced" feathers and a bantam. The feathers of this cross are beautifully
"laced"--that is, they are white, edged with black. Another interesting
diminutive breed is the JAPANESE BANTAM. The cock carries its tail, which
is long, remarkably high, giving a very quaint effect. This breed is
further interesting, since it furnishes us with an instance of the
breeder's power of localising colour by selection. The tail is black and
the body white. Yet another interesting Japanese fowl is the remarkable
long-tailed breed in which the tail-coverts grow continuously, attaining a
length of from 9 feet to, it is said, 18 feet. The birds are kept for show
purposes. The greater part of their lives is passed tethered on high
perches. Once a day they are taken down for exercise, when the long
feathers are carefully rolled up and securely fastened out of harm's way.

BLACK-CHESTED CRESTED GUINEA-FOWL.

This is a black bird, with light blue spots.]


THE ARGUS-PHEASANT AND PEACOCK AND THEIR ALLIES.

The ARGUS-PHEASANT most certainly demands notice, on account of the
extraordinary development of the wing-quills, which are nearly a yard long,
and the wondrous beauty of the pattern thereon. This pattern takes the form
of a number of eyes, so shaded as to give the appearance, when fully
displayed, of a number of balls lying in a socket. These enormous quills
are borne only by the male, and used, like the ornamental feathers of its
allies, in captivating the female. When fully displayed, the two wings are
spread out to form one huge fan, producing an effect which words cannot
adequately describe. The argus-pheasants are found in the forests of Siam,
the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra, and are excessively wary birds.

The PEACOCK is too well known to need a very long description. But a word
as to the so-called "tail." This magnificent wealth of plumes does not
represent the tail, as is popularly supposed, but is made up of the
feathers of the lower part of the back and the upper tail-coverts. These
gradually increase in length from before-backwards, culminating in the long
and exquisite feathers which form the circumference of the huge, outspread
shield. This shield is properly called the "train"; the true tail lies
behind it and acts as a support. When the bird is about to display, the
"train" feathers are slowly and gently raised till the well-known
fan-shaped glory of green and gold and blue is exposed to the fullest
possible extent.

NEST OF BRUSH-TURKEY AT WOBURN ABBEY.

This is made by several birds, of decaying vegetable matter, in which the
eggs are laid and left to hatch.]

TURKEY COCK AND HEN.

The curious "tassel" depending from the breast is found in no other bird.]

"Watch the bird trying to do his best to persuade his chosen what a
handsome fellow he is. He first places himself more or less in front of
her, but at some little distance off; and then, watching his opportunity,
walks rapidly backwards, going faster and faster and faster, till, arrived
within a foot, he suddenly, like a flash, turns round and displays to the
full his truly gorgeous vestments. This turning movement is accompanied by
a violent shaking of the train, the quills of which rattle like the
pattering of rain upon leaves. Often this movement is followed by a loud
scream.

"When the train is fully erect, it will be noticed that it lies so far
forward that the bird's head and neck appear as if rising from its base. In
a side view the whole body, from the front of the wings backwards, appears
to lie behind the train."

This bird is a native of India, where it is held in great reverence by the
Hindus, and in the Hindu States it is not allowed to be killed under any
circumstances. There are two, some say three, distinct species of peacock,
but they all closely resemble one another.

WALLACE'S PAINTED MEGAPODE.

This bird buries its eggs in the sand, burrowing for each a slanting hole
from 3 to 4 feet deep.]

Brief mention will serve for the GUINEA-FOWLS and TURKEYS, since they are
well known to us all. GUINEA-FOWLS are African birds. The farmyard form,
popularly known as "Come-backs," from their peculiar cry "come-back,
come-back, come-back," is a descendant of the common helmeted form, of
which type there are eight distinct species. Besides these are four crested
species; one very beautiful species known as the VULTURE-LIKE GUINEA-FOWL;
and one, the rarest of all, known as the BLACK GUINEA-FOWL. Even in the
British Museum, writes Mr. Ogilvie Grant, "there are only two examples of
it, and neither of these are perfect specimens." It was discovered by M. Du
Chaillu. "One day," he says, "I went out hunting by myself, and, to my
great joy, shot another new bird, a black wild-fowl, one of the most
singular birds I have seen in Africa.... The head, where it is bare, is in
the female of a pink hue, and in the male of a bright scarlet.... Wild they
are, and most difficult to approach, and rare, even in the forests where
they are at home." They do not travel in huge flocks, like other
guinea-fowls, but a male and two females at most.

The familiar form of the TURKEY scarcely needs description; but most people
are probably puzzled by its name. Why Turkey? The bird is a native of
America, so it certainly cannot have anything to do with its place of
origin. Professor Newton has it that it is on account of its call-note, "to
be syllabled 'turk, turk, turk,' whereby it may almost be said to have
named itself."

The domesticated turkey is descended from the MEXICAN TURKEY, and was
probably introduced into Europe during the sixteenth century. This,
according to Captain Bendire, is a mountain-living species, and still
abundant in the wilder portions of Western Texas and New Mexico. It appears
to attain greater bulk than its domesticated descendant, Captain Bendire
having recorded a specimen shot by himself which weighed 28 lbs. after
having been drawn, and heavier birds are said to occur occasionally.

The Mexicans say that the coyotes catch turkeys by running in circles under
the tree in which they are roosting, till the birds get dizzy with watching
them, and fall down into the open mouths below!

There are three distinct kinds of turkey--the MEXICAN, AMERICAN, and
HONDURAS TURKEY. The last is a very fine bird, with a bright blue head and
neck, instead of red. The top of the head is adorned with numerous scarlet,
berry-like warts, looking like holly-berries.

The BOB-WHITES, which belong to the group of tooth-billed game-birds known
as American Partridges and Quails, demand a brief reference here. The
species represented in the illustration on page 399 is common in the
lowlands of Texas. It is a very unsuspicious bird, and in consequence falls
an easy prey to foxes, hariers, and rattlesnakes, the last-named being the
worst enemies, as many as five of these unfortunate birds having been taken
at one time from the stomach of one of these monsters, and on another
occasion a female and half a dozen of her eggs were similarly discovered.

The MEGAPODES and BRUSH-TURKEYS, though dull and uninteresting-looking
birds, are, on account of the facts connected with the propagation of their
species, quite remarkable. They do not brood over their eggs, as do other
birds, but instead bury them, either in sand in the neighbourhood of warm
springs or in heaps of decaying vegetable matter. In the latter case the
material is often collected by several birds working together. Mounds of 8
feet high and 60 feet in circumference have been found, the work of the
NICOBAR MEGAPODE. Such have been many years in use, material being added
each season. Into this mass the female digs down and deposits an egg every
second day, covering it up as soon as laid. There it remains till hatched,
when the young, probably aided by its mother, forces its way up to the
surface, and emerges, _not_ a downy nestling as one would expect, but
clothed with feathers differing but slightly in texture from those worn in
the adult state. Owing to the precocious development, young megapodes are
able to fly within an hour after birth.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

RAZOR-BILLED CURASSOW.

So called from the sharp ridge along the top of the beak.]

There are many different kinds of megapodes occurring in Australia, Samoa,
and the Nicobar and Philippine Islands.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

CRESTED CURASSOW.

So called from its crest of curled feathers.]

The CURASSOWS and GUANS are very handsome birds, but probably quite unknown
to most of our readers, yet they may always be seen in Zoological Gardens.
They are closely related to the megapodes, which we have just been
discussing; but their nesting habits are quite different. They lay their
eggs in nests, either on the ground or in trees, and brood over them like
other birds. Many have brilliantly coloured bare skin on the head and
handsome crests. They are natives of Central and South America, where they
are often kept by the settlers, as they tame easily. It is said that one of
the guans, when crossed with the domesticated fowl, becomes intensely
pugnacious, and superior to the game-cock for fighting purposes.


BUSTARD-QUAIL AND PLAIN-WANDERERS.

These are small and quail-like in appearance, though they are probably only
distant relatives of the Game-birds. But they are, nevertheless, remarkable
birds. A great authority, Mr. A. O. Hume, writing of the INDIAN
BUSTARD-QUAIL, says of them: "The most remarkable point in the life-history
of these bustard-quails is the extraordinary fashion in which, amongst
them, the position of the sexes is reversed. The females are the larger and
handsomer birds. The females only call, the females only fight--natives say
that they fight for the males, and probably this is true. The males ...
only ... sit upon the eggs, the females meanwhile larking about, calling,
and fighting, without any care for their obedient mates; and, lastly, the
males tend ... the young brood."

The group has a wide geographical range, occurring in Europe, Africa,
Madagascar, South Asia, the Indian Archipelago, and Australia.


THE HOATZIN.

This bird is one of the puzzles of the ornithologist. Its pedigree is still
a mystery, but it is generally believed to have some relation to the
Game-birds. Its whole life is passed in trees overhanging water, and its
flight restricted to short journeys from tree to tree. In South America,
its home, it is known by a variety of names, one of which means
STINKING-PHEASANT. This is in allusion to the peculiar odour of its flesh,
which smells, according to some, like musk, and to others like raw hides.
Another remarkable feature of this bird is the fact that it has turned its
crop into a sort of gizzard, whilst the true gizzard, having been relieved
of its functions, has diminished to the size of a hazel-nut. The unusual
purpose to which the crop has been put has brought about considerable
modification in the form of the breast-bone, which is quite different to
that of any other bird.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

HOATZIN.

This is a native of the Amazons Valley, and lives entirely in the trees.]

The young of these birds are quite as remarkable as the parents, for almost
as soon as they are hatched they crawl out of the nest, along the boughs of
the tree in which it rests, to meet the parents coming with food. In these
crawling excursions they are aided by the wings, which for a time serve as
fore feet. The thumb and first finger are armed with strong claws, with
which a firm hold is gained on the bark of the tree. To render these claws
effective so long as they are necessary, the quill-feathers of the tip of
the wing have their development checked till the others have grown long
enough to serve the purposes of flight.


THE RAILS.

The RAILS are all water-loving birds, dwelling in swamps or on the borders
of lakes and streams. Although all swim easily, none have webbed feet. The
flight is weak; several species, indeed, have lost this power altogether.
The body is much compressed, enabling them to pass readily through the
narrow interspaces of dense aquatic foliage. The Rails appear to be related
on the one hand to the Game-birds, and on the other to the Cranes. In size
they vary from a bird as large as a fowl to one as small as a lark.

One of the commonest of the Rails is the CORN-CRAKE, more commonly,
perhaps, known as the LAND-RAIL. Its curious grating cry is one of the
commonest sounds which the summer brings with it, and one possessing a
charm of its own. But rarely seen, it builds its nest in hay-fields, and,
when the grass is being cut, sits so closely on its treasures that it is
sometimes beheaded by the swinging scythe. In the autumn it falls not
infrequently to the sportsmen when partridge-shooting. The corn-crake
leaves in the winter for the more congenial climate of Africa, a feat that
seems wonderful when its feeble powers of flight are considered. Its near
relative the WATER-RAIL is rather a handsome bird, but of shy and retiring
habits.

The WEKA-RAIL, a native of New Zealand, is one of the flightless forms to
which we have referred. It is about as large as a pheasant, but lacks its
splendour, being soberly clad in brown and black. Unlike its relative, it
breeds in a burrow, which it digs for itself by the aid of its bill. The
name "weka" was given it by the Maoris.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

WEKA-RAIL.

The wings, though fairly large, are useless for flight.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

WATER-RAIL.

This is a common British bird, seldom seen, on account of its retiring
habits.]

The COMMON WATER-HEN, or MOOR-HEN, is one of the most familiar birds of the
London parks. Although frequent enough to be seen upon streams and broads,
it is, nevertheless, shy and wary; but in the sanctuary of the public parks
all reserve is thrown off. The water-hen, like its allies, is an expert
swimmer, in spite of the fact that the toes are not webbed; on the
contrary, they are very long and slender. When alarmed, these birds will
often submerge the body till only the beak projects above water.

All the members of this group are easily recognised by the bare patch of
skin extending from the beak on to the top of the head. In the COOTS this
is white; in the WATER-HENS and GALLINULES it is red. The coots and
water-hens are clad in sober colours, grey or black; but the gallinules are
gorgeously clad in purple, shaded with dark green, olive-brown, and black.
MANTELL'S GALLINULE of New Zealand is probably now extinct, the last bird
having been killed in 1898.


THE FIN-FEET.

These are little-known birds, found in Africa, South America, South-east
Asia, and Sumatra. They are closely related to the coots, but differ
therefrom in many important particulars. Like the coots, they are
river-haunting birds, and have broad flaps of skin fringing the toes, which
serve the purpose of a web; but they have much longer necks and tails than
the coots and water-hens. Not much is known about them.

CHAPTER III.

_PIGEONS AND SAND-GROUSE._


Pigeons, as a rule, are birds of wonderful powers of flight. The young,
which never exceed two in number, are hatched perfectly blind and helpless,
and but sparsely clothed. They are nourished by a peculiar milky secretion
of the parents' crop known as "pigeons' milk." The operation of feeding is
performed by the parent thrusting its beak into the mouth of its offspring
and ejecting therein the secretion just referred to. The nest is a very
simple structure, being composed of twigs, generally placed in a tree, but
sometimes in a cave or hole in a bank. The eggs, which never exceed two in
number, are pure white.

Perhaps the most beautiful species occur among the large group known as
FRUIT-PIGEONS. Many of these are invested in raiment of vivid green and
yellow, forming a little coterie by themselves--the GREEN PIGEONS. Others,
on account of their brilliancy, have been designated PAINTED PIGEONS, of
which, perhaps, the most beautiful of all is EUGÈNE'S PIGEON. Try to
imagine it! The head is pure white, the upper part of the breast a
purple-red surrounded by a dull purple band; the under parts are greyish
green, shading into white; the flanks green; whilst the upper parts are
also green, but of a rich bronze tint. Another group from the Fiji Islands
includes a magnificent species, the male of which is clothed in a glorious
orange, save the head and throat, which are olive-yellow. His mate is
scarcely less beautiful, her plumage being rich green. Another member of
the group--the WHITE NUTMEG-PIGEON--is clad in creamy white, with black
quills, and a black tip to the tail. It is a native of Borneo. The
fruit-pigeons, it should be mentioned, include some of the largest of
living pigeons.

A PAIR OF YOUNG PIGEONS IN NEST.

The hair-like down of the young pigeon is quite different to any other
nestling down.]

Whilst many of the Pigeon Tribe seem to have succeeded in dyeing their
feathers with all the hues of the rainbow, others have secured equal glory
by a covering which at first sight would rather appear to be of burnished
metal than of feathers. The most striking instance of this is found in the
magnificent NICOBAR PIGEONS. There are two species of these birds, which
occur not only in the Nicobar Islands, from which they take their name, but
also in the Malay Archipelago and the Solomon and Pelew Islands. The
general tone of the one species is black, but the upper parts are superbly
glossed with bronze and copper reflections. The other, from the Pelew
Islands, is indigo-blue in general tone. In one of the Nicobar Islands
these birds occur in thousands. Furthermore, these two pigeons stand alone,
in that the neck-feathers are greatly elongated, forming "hackles" like
those of the common fowl.

The largest of living pigeons are the GOURAS, or CROWNED PIGEONS. There are
six species, all of which are confined to Australasia. They are
characterised by a huge and very beautiful fan-shaped crest of feathers
which springs from the crown of the head.

This is the largest of living pigeons.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

WONGA-WONGA PIGEON.

This bird is found in the brush country of Eastern Australia.]

At the other extreme stand the NAMAQUA and SCALY DOVES. The former is
regarded by Professor Newton as one of the most graceful in form of all the
Pigeon Tribe: the latter are scarcely, if at all, larger than the sparrows.

The power of flight of some forms is, however, extremely limited; they bid
fair in course of time to become flightless, like the dodo and the
solitaire. The most interesting of these is the GREY-NAPED GROUND-PIGEON.
Pigeons for the most part display a marked preference for a life among the
trees rather than on the ground; but there are some which are essentially
ground-dwellers. The species in which this changed habit is most deeply
rooted, and probably of longest standing, exhibit one very interesting
point of difference from their neighbours of the woods. This difference
consists in the very considerably longer legs which mark the
ground-haunting bird. The GREY-NAPED GROUND-PIGEON of South-east New Guinea
forms an excellent example, inasmuch as the legs are much longer than in
any other pigeon. These birds (for there are three species in all) resemble
the Megapodes in habit, and frequent hills or dense thickets. They lay one
egg, which is deposited at the foot of a tree.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

MALE BLACK-BELLIED SAND-GROUSE.

Young sand-grouse run directly they are hatched, thus differing from young
pigeons.]

Among domesticated breeds is the ENGLISH POUTER, a bird characterised by
its enormous gullet, which can be distended with air whenever the owner
wills. The carriage of the body is vertical, not, as in pigeons generally,
horizontal. The CARRIER is a breed illustrating the result of
long-sustained selection to increase, amongst other characters, the
development of the bare skin surrounding the eye and beak of all pigeons,
wild or tame. In the SHORT-FACED TUMBLER we have a breed wherein those
birds with the shortest beaks have been steadily bred from. To-day so
little beak is left that some individuals are hatched which, when grown up,
are unable to feed themselves. An example of a radical change in the
feathers is the INDIAN FRILL-BACK. In this case the feathers all over the
body are reversed, or turned forwards, giving the bird a quite
extraordinary appearance. In the JACOBIN we have a breed--and we could cite
others--wherein the feathers of the neck are much elongated, and turn
upwards and forwards over the head to form a hood.

In general appearance SAND-GROUSE are small, very short-legged birds, with
small heads and pointed wings and tail. Their general tone of coloration
may be described as sand-coloured, and this has been adopted to render them
in harmony with the barren sand-wastes in which they dwell. But some may be
described as quite highly coloured, being banded and splashed with
chestnut, black, pearly grey, white, and yellow, according to the species.

PALLAS'S SAND-GROUSE is a native of the Kirghiz Steppes, extending through
Central Asia to Mongolia and Northern China, and northwards to Lake Baikal,
and southwards to Turkestan. Here they may be met with in enormous numbers.
In North China large numbers are often caught after a snow-storm. The snow
is cleared away, and a small green bean is scattered about. Young
sand-grouse differ remarkably in one particular from young pigeons,
inasmuch as the former are hatched covered with a thick down, and are able
to run about soon after leaving the egg, whilst the pigeon comes into the
world very helpless and much in need of clothing. Three eggs are laid by
the sand-grouse, and these are double-spotted; whilst the pigeon lays but
two, which are white. The eggs of the sand-grouse are laid in a depression
in the ground, without any nest.

CHAPTER IV.

_AUKS, GULLS, AND PLOVERS._


THE AUK TRIBE.

The GUILLEMOT is found all around Britain, and breeds wherever the sea is
fringed by cliffs affording ledges for the reception of the eggs. It breeds
in colonies often numbering many thousands, and lays but one egg, which is
large and pear-shaped. Since the guillemot builds no nest, but lays its egg
on the bare rock, this peculiar shape is advantageous, since it revolves on
itself, when disturbed, instead of rolling off the ledge into the sea. At
the same time thousands of eggs fall into the sea every year owing to the
bird's leaving the egg, whilst incubating, in too great a hurry. At Lundy
Island one of the sources of amusement for the gaping tourist was that of
firing a shot to frighten the birds, with the result that, at each shot,
showers of eggs were knocked off the ledges on to the rocks below. The
colour of the egg varies infinitely, no two being quite alike. This, it has
been suggested, is useful, as the mother is thereby enabled to identify her
own egg, even when surrounded by hundreds of others. The young are covered
with long down, and when big enough, but still unable to fly, are taken
down by the mother to the sea, being carried, some say, on her back: others
say the chick is seized by the wing and carried down.

[Illustration: _By permission of the Hon. Walter Rothschild, Tring._

WHITE TERN.

There are two species of white tern, almost restricted to the Southern
Hemisphere.]

The RAZOR-BILL is nearly, if not quite, as common on the coasts of Britain
as the guillemot, from which it may be readily distinguished by its beak,
which is much compressed from side to side--hence its name of
Razor-bill--and deeply grooved. In habits it very closely resembles the
guillemot, but in one respect at least it is a more interesting bird,
inasmuch as it is related to and closely resembles the now extinct GREAT
AUK, the giant of the tribe. The smallest British representative, it should
be mentioned, is the LITTLE AUK, a species more nearly allied to the
guillemot. It is only a winter visitant to Britain, breeding in huge
colonies on the inhospitable shores of Greenland and Iceland.

So quaint a bird as the PUFFIN most certainly finds a place here. One of
its most characteristic features is its enormous bill, which is rendered
more conspicuous on account of its bright colour. It is bluish at the base,
yellow at the tip, and striped with orange. A very remarkable feature of
this bill is the fact that it is larger in summer than winter, portions of
the sheath being shed in autumn.

Enormous numbers of puffins breed in Ireland; myriads breed on Lundy
Island. The Farne Islands, the cliffs of Flamborough, and Scotland are also
tenanted by thousands. Puffins breed in holes, which they dig for
themselves when occasion requires, but when rabbit-burrows are to be had
they prefer these, dispossessing the owners without the slightest
compunction. Might, with the puffin, is right, as well as with many other
animals.

Young puffins, like young auks and guillemots, are hatched covered with
long down. The parents feed them on fish, which they deposit at the mouth
of the burrow twenty at a time, and give them to the young bird one by one.
When the female is sitting, her mate feeds her in a similar way.

Puffins lay only a single egg, which differs from that of its relatives the
Auks and Guillemots in being white. The white colour enables the
sitting-bird to see it in the dark burrow.


THE GULL TRIBE.

To get at the real inwardness of the Gull Tribe, so to speak, we must
examine their anatomy very closely; then we shall be convinced that they
are modified Plovers, and have nothing to do with the Petrels, to which
they bear an undoubted resemblance.


TERNS.

Terns are gulls in miniature, on which account it is probable that many a
visitor to the seashore passes them unwittingly. But let him watch next
time for what look like flocks of tiny, long-winged, and unusually active
gulls, now hovering gracefully in the air, and now suddenly plunging
headlong like an arrow to the sea, with a force and dash that will surprise
him, now that attention is drawn to them. These are terns. From their
vivacity and forked tails, they have been aptly named Sea-swallows.

[Illustration: _Photo by G. Watmough Webster & Son_]     [_Chester._

TERNS ON A SHINGLE BANK.

Terns lay their eggs among the shingle; from their coloration, these are
difficult to detect among the surrounding stones.]

There are several species of tern. Like the Gulls, they have a distinctive
dress for summer and winter, but the sexes are both dressed alike. The
general livery, as with the Gulls, is pearly grey above and pure white
below--in summer, in some species, relieved by a black head. One species,
the ROSEATE TERN, has the breast suffused with a most exquisite rose-pink,
which fades rapidly after death, however. Young terns, in their first
plumage, differ conspicuously from their parents, having much brown
intermixed with grey.

Terns lay about three eggs, which are deposited among the shingle on the
beach; and so closely do the eggs, and later on the young, resemble the
surrounding stones that it is almost impossible to find them. As a rule
terns breed in colonies, often numbering many thousand birds.

There are exceptions to the rule just laid down as to nest-building. One
species of the NODDY TERNS, for example, builds a nest of turf and dry
grass, placed in bushes or in low trees. It seems to return to the same
nest year after year, adding on each return new materials, till they form
masses nearly 2 feet in height. Occasionally it appears to make a mud-nest,
placed in the fork of a tree; whilst the superb little WHITE NODDY often
deposits its egg on the leaf of a cocoanut-palm--truly a wonderful site,
and still more wonderful when we reflect that it is chosen by one of the
Gull Tribe.

About six species of tern commonly occur in the British Islands, and some
five or six other species occasionally visit them.


SKIMMERS.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

HERRING-GULL.

So called from its habit of following the shoals of herrings.]

The SKIMMERS are tern-like birds, with a very wide geographical
distribution, occurring in India, Africa, and North and South America, and
remarkable for the very extraordinary form of the beak. The upper jaw is
much shorter than the lower, and both are compressed to the thinness of a
knife-blade. This beak is associated with, and is probably an adaptation
to, an equally remarkable method of feeding, which has been admirably
described by Darwin, who watched them feeding in a lake near Maldonado.

"They kept their bills," he says, "wide open, and the lower mandible half
buried in the water. Thus skimming the surface, they ploughed it in their
course; ... and it formed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock, each
bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirror-like surface. In their flight
... they dexterously manage with their projecting lower mandible to plough
up small fish, which are secured by the upper and shorter half of their
scissor-like bills."


THE GULLS.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

YOUNG HERRING-GULLS IN THE GREY PHASE OF PLUMAGE.

In their dull grey plumage the young of all gulls are very unlike the
adults.]

Gulls are larger and heavier birds than terns, with longer legs, and
shorter, thicker beaks. Furthermore, with one exception, the tail is never
forked. Like the terns, gulls generally breed in colonies, and these are
often of large size. Young gulls, when newly hatched, are quite active.
Later, when their feathers have grown, they are found to wear a dress quite
different from that of the parents. Sometimes the adult plumage is gained
at the end of the first year of existence, sometimes not until after the
third year. Gulls feed on everything that comes in their way, from fish
caught swimming at the surface of the sea to worms picked up at the
plough-tail.

One of the commonest and best known of all the gulls is perhaps the species
known as the BLACK-HEADED GULL, which has become so common in the heart of
busy London, where hundreds may be seen, during the winter months, flying
up and down the river, or wheeling about over the lakes in the parks. The
black-headed gull receives its popular name on account of the fact that,
like some terns and some other gulls, in the spring, the feathers of the
head suddenly acquire a sooty-black colour: all trace of this is lost in
the winter, save for two patches, one behind each ear.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

STONE-CURLEW, OR THICK-KNEE.

The plumage so closely resembles the sandy soil on which the bird lives
that concealment is easily effected by crouching close to the ground.]

The eggs of this bird are collected in thousands each spring, and sold in
London and other markets as plovers' eggs. As many as 20,000 have been
taken in a season from the extensive gullery at Scoulton Mere, in Norfolk.

Three or four eggs are laid in a nest of rushes, which is always placed on
the ground in marshy and often inaccessible spots.

The largest of the Gull Tribe is the GREAT BLACK-BACKED GULL, which is,
furthermore, a common British bird; indeed, it is frequently seen flying,
together with the last-mentioned species, on the Thames, doing its best to
get a full share of the tit-bits thrown by interested spectators from the
various London bridges. Unlike the black-headed gull, it has no seasonal
change of plumage, but is clad all the year round in the purest white, set
off by a mantle of bluish black. The young of this bird has a quite
distinct plumage of greyish brown, and hence has been described as a
distinct species--the GREY GULL. This dress is gradually changed for the
adult plumage, but the process takes about three years.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

CURLEW.

So called on account of its note.]

The KITTIWAKE is another of the common British gulls, breeding in thousands
in favourable localities on the coasts. Its eggs are deposited on the
narrowest and most inaccessible ledges of precipitous cliffs. This species
sometimes falls a victim to the fashion of wearing feathers. "At Clovelly,"
writes Mr. Howard Saunders, "there was a regular staff for preparing
plumes; and fishing-smacks, with extra boats and crews, used to commence
their work of destruction at Lundy Island by daybreak on the 1st of
August.... In many cases the wings were torn off the wounded birds before
they were dead, the mangled victims being tossed back into the water." And
he has seen, he continues, "hundreds of young birds dead or dying of
starvation in the nests, through the want of their parents' care.... It is
well within the mark to say that at least 9,000 of these inoffensive birds
were destroyed during the fortnight."

Of the SKUA-GULLS there are several species. Their coloration differs from
that of the gulls just described in being confined to shades of brown. One
of their most remarkable traits is that of piracy. They await their cousins
the Gulls coming shoreward from the sea with newly swallowed fish, and
then, giving chase, compel the gull, in order to lighten itself and escape,
to disgorge its hard-won meal. So swift of flight is the skua that the
ejected morsel is caught before it reaches the water.


THE PLOVER TRIBE.

BIRDS of very various size, shape, and coloration are included in this
group--that is to say, birds which vary much superficially, but, it must be
understood, all undoubtedly closely related. In England they are to be met
with almost everywhere. The seashore, the lonely moorland, the desolate
marshes, the river's brink, or the woods--all these shelter some one or
other of the Plover Tribe. Like the Gulls, many adopt a distinctive dress
for the courting-season, which, however, is sometimes worn by the males
only, and not by both sexes alike, as in the Gulls. One of the most
striking and familiar instances of this change is seen in the GREY PLOVER.
In winter the plumage of the upper-parts of this bird is dusky grey, that
of the under-parts pure white; but in the spring the former is exchanged
for a beautifully variegated mantle of black and white, and the latter
becomes uniformly jet-black, save the under tail-coverts, which remain
white.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

WOODCOCK.

The female is larger than the male.]

[Illustration: _Photo by A. H. P. Cruickshank_]     [_Wellington._

OYSTER-CATCHER ON ITS NEST.

Three eggs are laid in a slight hollow in the ground. The oyster-catcher is
one of the most wary of the Plover Tribe, and very difficult to approach.]

In the DUNLIN, again, we have a similar change, the upper-parts being in
winter grey, the under-parts white: in the spring the former become black,
with an admixture of rust-colour, and the latter black in so far as the
breast is concerned, but the abdomen remains white.

In many of that section of the Plover Tribe distinguished as
"Wading-birds," the changes which take place in the spring in the plumage
of the upper-parts resemble those already instanced, but the under-parts
turn to a rich chestnut instead of black. This occurs in the forms known as
the GODWITS, KNOTS, and SANDERLINGS, for example.

In all the instances so far quoted, both male and female are coloured
alike, but, as already hinted, occasionally the change of plumage affects
the male only. This is the case with the RUFF. The importance of this
exception is still further increased by the fact that the change in
coloration is accompanied by the development of a large frill around the
neck, surmounted by two large tufts called "ears," and fleshy, brightly
coloured warts around the beak. The coloured picture of the male in its
spring dress, which will be found on another page, gives an admirable idea
of the typical ruff, but it must necessarily fail to give any indication of
one very remarkable fact concerning this frill and the two "ears," and for
this reason--no two individuals ever have these peculiar feathers of the
same coloration and pattern. The range of colour is certainly not
great--the changes being rung, so to speak, on black, white, chestnut, bay,
and ash-colour. Diversification is gained by contrasting the "ears" with
the frill, and adding bars or streaks to the light coloration, and purple,
green, and violet reflections to the dark. These ornaments are donned in a
surprisingly short space of time, and are discarded as quickly, for they
are scarcely completed by the month of May, and are thrown off again at the
end of June. During the time that this resplendent livery is worn the males
engage in mimic battles--which may occasionally develop into real
ones--arranged apparently for the edification of the females, which, it
seems, select as partners, at least for that season, those which please or
excite most. This power of pleasing must certainly be considerable, for the
ruff is a polygamous species.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

DENHAM'S BUSTARD.

This species, when "showing off," fills the gullet with air, having no
special air-sac like the great bustard.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

GREAT BUSTARDS.

The cock on the right is "showing off."]

Formerly the ruff was a common bird in England, but the drainage of the
fens and persecution have practically brought about its extermination.

At least two groups of plovers have succeeded in reversing the usual order
of things in the matter of sexual plumage. These are the PHALAROPES--which
are British birds--and the PAINTED SNIPE, in both of which the female is
more brightly coloured and somewhat larger in size than the male. As is the
case where this reversal occurs, the duties of incubation fall mainly or
entirely upon the smaller and duller male. It is interesting to note,
furthermore, that only in the phalaropes is there a seasonal change of
plumage: in the painted snipe the same livery is worn all the year round.

Many of the plovers have no seasonal change of plumage, but both male and
female wear all the year round, some a more or less markedly
bright-coloured livery, as the DOTTEREL and TURNSTONES, others a more sober
vestment, as the CURLEWS and SNIPE, for example.

The SNIPE and WOODCOCK may be cited as especially instructive forms in this
connection, showing, in regard to the beak, for instance, undoubted proof
of this structural modification, the result of adaptation to the peculiar
method of seeking their food. This beak constitutes an organ of touch of
great sensitiveness, and is used as a probe, to thrust down into the soft
soil in the search for hidden worms.

[Illustration: _Photo by Billington_]     [_Queensland._

INDIAN BUSTARDS.

Bustards have very short toes, like many other birds which walk much on
sandy soil.]

Of the three species of snipe which occur in Britain, probably the one
known as the COMMON SNIPE is most familiar; but it will, perhaps, be new to
some to learn that this bird ranks as a musical performer, on account of a
very extraordinary "bleating" or "drumming" noise which it gives forth,
especially during the spring of the year--the season of courtship. We
cannot describe this noise better, perhaps, than as an unusually
high-pitched "hum," produced, it is generally held, by wind driven between
the outer tail-feathers by the rapid vibration of the wings as the bird
descends, or rather pitches, at a fearful pace, earthwards. These feathers
have the shafts peculiarly thickened; and it is interesting to note that
the characteristic sound may be artificially produced if they be fastened
to a stick and rapidly whirled through the air.

The snipe and woodcock are not the only members of the Plover Tribe whose
beaks have undergone marked structural modifications; indeed, many
instances could be cited, but two or three must suffice. In the AVOCET the
beak turns upwards like an awl, and the bird is in consequence known in
some places as the COBBLER'S-AWL DUCK. In one particular, however, the beak
differs from an awl, tapering as it does to an exceedingly fine point. When
the bird feeds, it walks along in shallow water with the curved tip of the
beak resting on the surface and the head moving swiftly from side to side,
the jaws meanwhile being opened and closed with exceeding rapidity, and
seizing instantly upon such small crustacea and other organisms as come in
their way.

Although all the Plovers might be described as long-legged birds, the
STILTS are quite exceptionally so, and afford evidence of modification in
another direction. Relatively to the size of the body, the stilts have the
longest legs of all living birds. They seek their prey by wading in shallow
water, like the Avocets, to which they are closely related. One
species--the BLACK-WINGED STILT--occasionally appears in Britain.

Some other members of the Plover Tribe--the JACANA of Brazil, and the
WATER-PHEASANT of India, Ceylon, and China, for example--have enormously
long toes, as well as claws of great length.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando_]     [_Regent's Park._

STANLEY CRANE.

This is a South African species.]

These birds are furthermore remarkable for the possession of formidable
weapons of offence, borne on the wrist-joint of the wing, in the shape of
long, sharp, and powerful spurs. Similar weapons are carried by certain
plovers--the EGYPTIAN SPUR-WINGED PLOVER, for instance.




----



CHAPTER V.

_BUSTARDS AND CRANES._


The Plover Tribe, Bustards, Cranes, and Rails form a large group of diverse
but probably closely related forms.

Of the Bustards, the most interesting and important species is the GREAT
BUSTARD. About a hundred years ago this magnificent bird might have been
seen any day in such favoured localities as the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire
wolds, the Norfolk and Suffolk "brecks," the heaths of Newmarket, or the
downs of Berkshire and Wiltshire. It owes its extermination to several
causes, foremost among which must be reckoned the reclaiming of waste land
and improved methods of agriculture. "The bulk of its body," says Professor
Newton, "renders it a conspicuous and stately object; and when on the wing,
to which it readily takes, its flight is not inferior in majesty to that of
the eagle." The expanse of the outstretched wings of a great bustard is 8
feet, or even more; and the weight of the male may even exceed 35 lbs. The
female is smaller.

[Illustration: _Photo by Ottomar Anschütz_]     [_Berlin._

COMMON CRANE.

This handsome bird used to breed in Britain till the end of the sixteenth
century.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co., Parson's Green._

MANCHURIAN CRANE.

The piebald plumage of this species is distinctive.]

To see the great bustard in a wild state to-day, one would have to travel
to Spain. And if one could make a pilgrimage for this purpose during the
birds' courting-season, some very wonderful antics on the part of the male
would be witnessed. These antics make up what is really a very elaborate
love-display. In this performance the bird inflates his neck with wind,
draws his head closely down on to the back, throws up his tail, so as to
make the most of the pure white feathers underneath, and sticks up certain
of the quill-feathers of the wing in a manner that only a great bustard
can. Certain long feathers projecting from each side of the head now stand
out like the quills of the porcupine, forming a sort of _cheval-de-frise_
on either side of the head, and complete the picture, which, in our eyes,
savours of the ludicrous. The inflation of the neck is brought about by
filling a specially developed wind-bag between the gullet and the skin with
air through a small hole under the tongue. For many years it was believed
this bag was used as a sort of water-bottle, to enable the bird to live
amid the arid wastes which were its chosen haunts. We now know what its
real use is. Visitors to the Natural History Museum in London will find,
beautifully mounted, a male bustard "in the act of showing off," as it is
called, and hard by a dissection of the head and neck, showing this
wonderful wind-bag.

One of the most beautiful of this group of peculiarly handsome birds was
once numbered among British birds; now, alas! like the bustard, it is one
of the rarest visitors. Till the end of the sixteenth century the COMMON
CRANE reared its young in the fen-lands. In Saxon times we read of a
request being made by King Ethelbert to Boniface, Bishop of Mayence,
begging him to send over two falcons suitable for flying at the cranes in
Kent. In one case, at a feast given by Archbishop Neville in the reign of
Edward IV., as many as 204 cranes figured in the menu. Later, it is
interesting to note, they seem to have fallen somewhat into disfavour,
since we read of a Dr. Muffet, of Wiltshire, somewhere about 1570,
declaring cranes to be "distinctly unfit for sound men's tables.... Yet
being young, killed with a goshawk, and hanged two or three days by the
heels, eaten with hot gelentine, and drowned in sack, it is permitted unto
indifferent stomachs."

SERIEMA.

A South American bird, at one time supposed to be related to the birds of
prey.]

The nest is placed on the ground, and contains from two to three eggs. The
young are covered with down, and, like plovers and bustards, run as soon as
hatched.

The cranes, like many other birds, notably some of the Plover Tribe,
occasionally indulge in spirited outbursts of dancing. Mr. Nelson, writing
of the birds of Alaska, tells how one day he was watching two cranes
enjoying themselves in this manner. The male suddenly "wheeled his back
towards the female and made a low bow, his head nearly touching the ground,
and ending by a quick leap into the air. Another pirouette brought him
facing his charmer, whom he greeted with a still deeper bow, his wings
meanwhile hanging loosely by his side. She replied by an answering bow and
hop, and then each tried to outdo the other in a series of spasmodic hops
and starts, mixed with a set of comically grave and ceremonious bows."

Cranes vary much in general appearance. Some species have much of the skin
round the head bare and brilliantly coloured, such as the SARUS CRANE of
India and the CROWNED CRANE.

WHITE-BACKED TRUMPETERS.

The trumpeters are very aberrant members of the Crane Tribe.]

The WHITE and WHOOPING CRANES are birds of wondrous beauty. The first-named
species has been not inaptly called the "lily of birds." The whole plumage,
with the exception of the black quills, is white. The legs are red, as is
also the face. Dr. Coues, an American ornithologist of great repute,
relates how he once mistook one of these birds--the WHOOPING-CRANE--for an
antelope. He and a companion saw what they "took to be an antelope standing
quietly feeding, with his broad white stern toward us, and only about 500
yards off. We attempted for at least fifteen minutes to 'flag' the creature
up to us, waving a handkerchief on a ramrod.... This proving unavailing, my
friend proceeded to stalk the game, and crawled on his belly for about half
the distance before the 'antelope' unfolded his broad black-tipped wings
and flapped off, revealed at length as a whooping (white) crane."

GREAT CRESTED GREBE.

Young grebes in down are beautifully striped.]

Another very remarkable species is the CROWNED CRANE. This is an African
species, and takes its name from the tuft of curiously modified feathers on
the top of the head. The coloured plate gives a good idea of its general
appearance.


THE SERIEMA.

This is a very hawklike-looking bird; indeed, by some ornithologists it has
been regarded as closely allied to the Hawks and Eagles, and more
especially to the Secretary-bird (page 467). Really, however, it is a very
ancient kind of crane.

The TRUMPETERS, the COURLANS, the KAGU, and the SUN-BITTERN are other
ornithological puzzles. Concerning the precise affinities of these birds
much is yet to be learnt; they are, however, undoubtedly related to the
Cranes. The last mentioned is a small bird, with wonderfully beautiful
wings, which it displays with great effect to its mate during the
courting-season.

CHAPTER VI.

_GREBES AND DIVERS, PENGUINS, AND TUBE-NOSED BIRDS._


THE GREBES AND DIVERS.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

BLACK-THROATED DIVERS.

These very handsome birds breed in Scotland.]

The Grebes and Divers are representatives of an exceedingly ancient type,
and are in many ways besides very interesting. Both are common British
birds. The greater part of their lives is spent upon the water, and to suit
this aquatic existence their bodies are specially modified. One of the
principal features of this modification is seen in the position of the
legs. These, by a shortening of the thigh-bones in the grebes, leave the
body so far back that when the bird walks the body is held vertically. With
the divers walking has become an impossibility, and they can only move on
land on their bellies, pushing themselves along with the feet. Both grebes
and divers are expert swimmers, and dive with the greatest ease, remaining
long under water. The grebes haunt ponds, lakes, and broads; the divers
prefer the open sea. Both feed on fish.

[Illustration: _Photo by G. W. Wilson & Co., Ltd._]     [_Aberdeen._

ROCK-HOPPER PENGUIN.

The name Rock-hopper is given in allusion to the habit of hopping over
boulders of rock.]


GREBES.

Of the numerous species of grebe, the most familiar are the GREAT CRESTED
GREBE and the little DABCHICK. The former has suffered grievous persecution
for the sake of its beautiful breast-feathers, which Fashion decreed should
be worn by the gentler sex in the form of muffs or hats. Thus a price was
set upon the head of this beautiful and harmless bird, and its ranks were
speedily thinned. Some species wear during the nesting-season beautiful
chestnut or golden "ears," "horns," or "frills" on the head and neck. The
EARED GREBE is especially magnificent at this time.


DIVERS.

These, as already remarked, are sea-loving birds, but they breed inland on
the shores of lakes. There are not many species of divers, but, like the
grebes, they assume a special dress during the nesting-season, more
beautiful than the winter dress.


THE PENGUINS.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

BLACK-FOOTED PENGUIN.

This bird, also known as the Cape or Jackass-penguin, breeds in burrows or
under ledges of rock.]

The PENGUINS may justly be called wonderful birds, and they are undoubtedly
of very ancient descent. For countless generations the sea has been their
home and refuge, and, in consequence, flight has been abandoned in exchange
for increased swimming-powers, which have been gained by transforming the
wing into a paddle. This transformation has resulted in flattening the
wing-bones--and so increasing the surface of the hand and arm whilst
reducing its thickness--and the suppression of the quill-feathers. The
result is a blade-like paddle closely resembling the paddle of the whale,
the turtle, or the extinct fish-lizards. With this organ they cleave their
way through the water, often far below the surface, in pursuit of food,
just as of old their ancestors did through the air. In other diving-birds
the wings are kept closely pressed to the side of the body when under
water, whilst the locomotion is effected by the feet. The penguin's legs,
in consequence of diminished use, have shortened considerably. But besides
the wings and legs, the feathery covering has also undergone a certain
amount of change. This has been effected by increasing the size of the
shaft of the feather and diminishing the vane; as a result, on the front
part of the wings these feathers look more like scales than feathers.

Professor Moseley has vividly described the appearance of a flock of
penguins at sea. He writes from Tristan d'Acunha: "As we approached the
shore, I was astonished at seeing a shoal of what looked like extremely
active, very small porpoises or dolphins.... They showed black above and
white beneath, and came along in a shoal of fifty or more..towards the
shore at a rapid pace, by a series of successive leaps out of the water and
leaps into it again ... Splash, splash, went this marvellous shoal of
animals, till they went splash through the surf on to the black, stony
beach, and then struggled and jumped up amongst the boulders and revealed
themselves as wet and dripping penguins."

Like their relatives in other parts of the world, penguins breed in huge
communities known as "rookeries," a rookery being peopled by tens of
thousands. Their nests, made of small stones, are placed among the tall
grass and reached by beaten pathways, exceedingly difficult to walk
through. Professor Moseley thus describes a "rookery": "At first you try to
avoid the nests, but soon find that impossible; then, maddened almost by
the pain [for they bite furiously at the legs], stench, and noise, you have
recourse to brutality. Thump, thump, goes your stick, and at each blow down
goes a bird. Thud, thud, you hear from the men behind you as they kick the
birds right and left off the nests; and so you go for a bit--thump, smash,
whack, thud, 'caa, caa, urr, urr,' and the path behind you is strewn with
the dead and dying and bleeding. Of course, it is horribly cruel thus to
kill whole families of innocent birds, but it is absolutely necessary. One
must cross the rookeries in order to explore the island at all, and collect
the plants, or survey the coasts from the heights."

Penguins feed principally on crustacea, molluscs ("shell-fish"), and small
fish, varied with a little vegetable matter. Although the legs are very
short, penguins yet walk with ease, and can, on occasion, run with
considerable speed. It would appear, however, as if the largest of the
tribe, the EMPEROR-PENGUIN, had become somewhat too bulky to run; for when
speed is necessary it lies down upon the snow and propels itself with its
feet, travelling, it is said, in this manner with incredible speed.

[Illustration: _Photo by Percy Ashenden_]     [_Cape Town._

BLACK-FOOTED PENGUINS BATHING.

The name Jackass is bestowed because the noise made by these birds closely
resembles the bray of a donkey.]

Penguins, though confined to the Southern Hemisphere, enjoy a wide range
and every variety of climate. They are found on the Antarctic ice, on the
shores of South Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and inhabit
many islands of the southern seas, notably the Falklands, Kerguelen, and
Tristan d'Acunha. In size penguins vary greatly. The largest is the
EMPEROR-PENGUIN of the Antarctic seas; scarcely smaller is the KING-PENGUIN
of Kerguelen Island. The emperor-penguin stands some 3½ feet high, and may
weigh as much as 78 lbs. The GENTLE PENGUIN, or "Johnny" of the sailors, is
next in size, being but little smaller than the king-penguin; this species
inhabits Kerguelen Island and the Falklands. The CRESTED PENGUINS, or
ROCK-HOPPERS, of which there are several species, are much smaller; they
occur in the Falkland Islands, New Zealand, and the Antarctic. The South
African form is known as the BLACK-FOOTED PENGUIN. Its nearest allies are
HUMBOLDT'S PENGUIN of Western South America, and the JACKASS-PENGUIN of the
Falklands. The smallest of all is the little BLUE PENGUIN of South
Australia and New Zealand, standing only 17 inches high.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

KING-PENGUIN.

This is one of the largest of the Penguins.]


THE TUBE-NOSED BIRDS.

Until recently these birds were believed to be closely related to the
Gulls, but it is now generally agreed that they are really distant
relatives of the Divers and Penguins. The association with the Gulls was
pardonable, for they certainly bear a superficial resemblance to them. The
birds now under discussion may be readily distinguished from the Gulls by
the fact that the nostrils open into a tube on the top of the beak, or a
pair of tubes, one on either side--hence the name of the group. Like the
Gulls, they are sea-birds and web-footed. Their young are downy and for a
time helpless. One egg is laid, which is white, and in some cases spotted
with red at the large end. As a rule no nest is made, but the egg laid on
the bare ground, in a hole or burrow or in crevices of rocks. The
Albatrosses build a nest of earth, tufts of grass, and moss, the whole
structure raising the sitting-bird well above the ground. The Giant and
Fulmar Petrels also build nests. The albatross is said by Professor Moseley
to hold the egg in a pouch while sitting, as in the case of the
king-penguin. The nature of this pouch has never been described.

Although occurring in the seas of all parts of the world, the Southern
Hemisphere must be regarded as their headquarters, since here the greatest
number of species are found. All are carnivorous, and--with the exception
of one small group, the Diving-petrels of the Strait of Magellan--are birds
of powerful flight. A large number of species belong to this group, but an
enumeration of all would be wearisome. A few of the more striking have,
therefore, been selected for description.


THE ALBATROSSES.

It was an albatross which brought such woe upon the ancient mariner whose
pitiful story is so feelingly told by Coleridge. But the tables are
occasionally turned, for men falling overboard in southern seas are liable
to be attacked by these powerful giants. The albatross is mostly renowned
for its majestic flight. Mr. Froude has given us a wonderful description of
this flight, which is quoted with approval by Professor Newton. It runs as
follows: "The albatross wheels in circles round and round, and for ever
round the ship--now far behind, now sweeping past in a long, rapid curve,
like a perfect skater on an untouched field of ice. There is no effort;
watch as closely as you will, you rarely or never see a stroke of the
mighty pinion. The flight is generally near the water, often close to it.
You lose sight of the bird as he disappears in the hollow between the
waves, and catch him again as he rises over the crest; but how he rises and
whence comes the propelling force is to the eye inexplicable: he alters
merely the angle at which the wings are inclined; usually they are parallel
to the water and horizontal; but when he turns to ascend or makes a change
in his direction, the wings then point at an angle, one to the sky, the
other to the water."

Professor Hutton, speaking with similar enthusiasm of the wonderful flight,
gives us, however, another side to the picture. "Suddenly," he says, "he
sees something floating on the water, and prepares to alight; but how
changed he now is from the noble bird but a moment before, all grace and
symmetry! He raises his wings, his head goes back, and his back goes in;
down drop two enormous webbed feet, straddled out to their full extent; and
with a hoarse croak, between the cry of a raven and that of a sheep, he
falls 'souse' into the water. Here he is at home again, breasting the waves
like a cork. Presently he stretches out his neck, and with great exertion
of his wings runs along the top of the water for seventy or eighty yards,
until, at last, having got sufficient impetus, he tucks up his legs, and is
once more fairly launched in the air."

NESTING ALBATROSSES ON LAYSAN ISLAND.

This colony was of enormous size, and included thousands of birds.]

For the wonderful photographs of the albatross at home we are indebted to
the Hon. Walter Rothschild. They are from his book on the avifauna of
Laysan Island, in the North Pacific. Unfortunately for the albatrosses and
other birds, traders have been attracted to Laysan for the sake of the
guano deposits. The birds were strictly protected during the occupation of
Mr. Preece, but when he left they had no friend to shield them, and their
eggs were taken in cart-loads, as the accompanying photograph shows.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

WHITE-CAPPED ALBATROSS ON EGG.

Professor Moseley describes the egg of the albatross as being held in a
sort of pouch.]

When an albatross makes love, Professor Moseley tells us, he stands "by the
female on the nest, raises his wings, spreads his tail and elevates it,
throws up his head with the bill in the air, or stretches it straight out
forwards as far as he can, and then utters a curious cry.... Whilst
uttering the cry the bird sways his neck up and down. The female responds
with a similar note, and they bring the tips of their bills lovingly
together. This sort of thing goes on for half an hour or so at a time."

There are several different kinds of albatross. The largest measures over
11 feet across the out stretched wings. They are inhabitants of the
southern seas.

CARTING ALBATROSS EGGS ON THE ISLAND OF LAYSAN.

At one time these birds were protected; as this photograph testifies, this
is no longer the case.]

After the Albatrosses, the largest bird of the group is the GIANT PETREL.
The sailors call it "Break-bones," "Nelly," or "Stinker." In habits it
differs much from its aristocratic relative the albatross, haunting the
coasts in search of dead seals and whales, and the bodies of other birds.
Professor Moseley aptly likens it to the vulture: "It soars all day along
the coast on the look-out for food. No sooner is an animal killed than
numbers appear as if by magic, and the birds are evidently well acquainted
with the usual proceedings of sealers, who kill the sea-elephant, take off
the skin and blubber, and leave the carcase. The birds gorge themselves
with food, just like the vultures, and are then unable to fly. I came
across half a dozen at Christmas Harbour in this condition. We landed just
opposite them; they began to run to get out of the way. The men chased
them; they ran off, spreading their wings, but unable to rise. Some
struggled into the water and swam away, but two went running on, gradually
disgorging their food, in the utmost hurry, until they were able to rise,
when they made off to sea."

The FULMAR PETREL is a British bird. On St. Kilda, Professor Newton tells
us, from 18,000 to 20,000 young are killed in one week in August, the only
time when, by the custom of the community, they are allowed to be taken.
These, after the oil is extracted, serve the islanders for winter food.

The STORM-PETREL is a small bird which breeds abundantly in St. Kilda and
the Orkneys, and so fearless that it will allow itself to be taken from the
nest by hand. Immediately this is done, the bird vomits a quantity of pure
oil from its mouth. The wild-fowlers make use of this habit, capturing the
bird, collecting the oil, and setting the prisoner free again. A story is
related of a storm-petrel which was kept in a cage for three weeks. It was
fed by smearing its breast with oil, which the bird swallowed by drawing
the feathers separately through its beak. These birds are popularly
supposed to be seen only before stormy weather, and therefore are not
welcomed by sailors, who call them "Devil's Birds" and "Witches." This bird
seems to commend itself to some palates; thus the late Mr. Seebohm says:
"Cooked on toast, like snipe, we found them delicious eating, very rich,
but not at all fishy."

We cannot refrain from a brief mention of the remarkable little
DIVING-PETREL--remarkable because of its unlikeness to all the other
Petrels and its strong resemblance to the Auks. But its tubular nostrils
and certain anatomical characters proclaim its true affinities. "This is a
petrel," says Professor Moseley, "that has given up the active aerial
habits of its allies, and has taken to diving, and has become specially
modified by natural selection to suit it for this changed habit, though
still a petrel in essential structure." On two occasions Professor Moseley
met with them in the Strait of Magellan, and describes the water as being
covered with these birds in flocks extending over acres, which were made
black with them.

CHAPTER VII.

_STORKS, HERONS, AND PELICAN TRIBE._


The Storks, Herons, and Pelican Tribe form a group of closely allied but
externally very unlike birds, distantly related to the Petrels on the one
hand, and the Cranes and Hawk Tribe on the other.


THE STORKS.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. Medland, F.Z.S._]     [_North Finchley._

FULMAR PETREL.

Like the vulture, this bird will so gorge itself with food as to be unable,
for a time, to fly.]

There are few birds which have figured more prominently in the realms of
fairy-tale and fable than the WHITE STORK. Today it is almost universally
held in affectionate regard, and in Holland, Denmark, and Germany is
afforded the strictest protection, every effort being made, in localities
where it is plentiful, to induce it to build its nest upon the house-roof.
Sometimes, to effect this, its fondness for a stage of some sort being
known, a cart-wheel is set up, and this generally proves successful, the
grateful bird erecting thereon its nest. Once occupied, it may be held by
several generations of tenants; and year by year additions are made to the
nest, so that the original shallow structure at last attains a height of
several feet. The material used in its construction consists of sticks and
other substances. He considers himself a fortunate man indeed who can boast
a stork's nest on his house.

To show how widespread is the regard in which this bird is held, we may
mention that in Morocco, according to Colonel Irby, "almost every Moorish
hovel has its stork's nest on the top, a pile of sticks lined with grass
and palmetto-fibre," and he goes on to relate that in "Morocco and Fez, and
some other large towns in the Moorish Empire, there is a regular storks'
hospital, and that, should one be in any way injured or fall from the nest,
it is sent to this institution, or rather enclosure, which is kept up by
subscriptions from wealthy Moors, who regard the stork as a sacred bird."

Though the nest appears to be generally placed upon buildings, it is, when
these fail, built in trees, and the selection of such sites must be
regarded as representing the original practice of the species.

The stork is one of the very few birds which appear to be quite dumb. It
supplies the want of a voice by a very remarkable clapping noise made by
the long, horny beak. But even this noise is rarely made, and appears to be
prompted by unusual excitement. "During the breeding-season," Mr. Howard
Saunders tells us, "storks keep up a clappering with their bills, and this
sound may frequently be heard proceeding from a number of birds circling in
the air at such a height as to be almost invisible."

The affection displayed by storks for their young is proverbial. They feed
them by thrusting their beaks down into the gaping little mouths, and
injecting the half-digested remains of their last meal, which may represent
reptile, frog, or fish, varied by a small mammal, young bird, worms, or
insects.

The white stork is a really beautiful bird. Except the quill- and some of
the smaller wing-feathers, which are black, the plumage is snow-white,
whilst the bill and the legs are bright red. Like the swallow, it performs
extensive migrations, travelling in flocks, numbering many thousands, at an
immense height.

Scarcely less beautiful is the BLACK STORK, and, like its white-plumaged
ally, it is also an occasional visitant to Britain. It is a handsome bird,
having the plumage of the upper-parts black, richly glossed with purple,
copper, and green; the under-parts pure white; and the legs and beak red.
But it is far less sociable, and consequently less known, than the white
stork, shunning the haunts of men, and seeking seclusion for its nest in
the lofty trees of large forests.

The largest members of the Stork Tribe are the ADJUTANT-STORKS and JABIRUS.
The adjutants are also, to our eyes at least, singularly ugly birds. In
spite of this very natural disadvantage, they have won a very high place in
the regard of the people among whom they dwell, on account of the fact
that, both in Africa and India, they perform, with the vultures, the work
of scavengers. Yet there is something of quaintness about these birds, if
they are watched from a distance too great to reveal the character which
imparts the ugliness to which we have referred, and their actions not
seldom border on the grotesque. The name Adjutant has been bestowed upon
them on account of the peculiar gait, which bears a fanciful resemblance to
the measured pacing of an officer on parade. Like all the Storks, they have
large bodies and very long legs, but they have outstripped all their
relatives in the enormous size of the beak. The features which have earned
this unenviable reputation for ugliness are the peculiarly unkempt and
unwashed appearance of the head and neck. These are but scantily clothed in
very shabby, brown-looking down-feathers; and the neck is made still more,
we might almost say, repulsive by the presence of a large bare pouch, which
can be distended with air to an enormous size at will. The Arabs, on
account of this pouch, call the species resident with them "The Father of
the Leather Bottle." Some, however, say that the correct translation of the
native name would be "The Father of the Beak." But it is not only on
account of their scavenging propensities that the adjutants are esteemed,
for it is from the under tail-coverts of these birds that the much-prized
"marabou" or "comercolly" feathers are obtained--at least the finest kinds;
for some appear to be furnished by that chief of scavengers, the vulture.
More precious still "is the celebrated stone called Zahir mora, or
poison-killer, of great virtue and repute as an antidote to all kinds of
poison," to be procured only by splitting open the head of the bird before
death. Needless to say, the existence of this stone lives only in popular
superstition, though how many poor birds have fallen victims thereto is not
pleasant to contemplate.

This shows the bird in a rather unusual attitude.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co., Parson's Green._

JABIRU STORK.

This bird stands between 4 and 5 feet high.]

Adjutants choose almost inaccessible pinnacles of rock on which to build
their nests, though they sometimes nest in trees. From two to four white
eggs are laid, from which, if all goes well, as many young, covered with
fluffy white down, are hatched.

The JABIRUS are distant relatives of, and scarcely inferior in size to, the
Adjutants. There are three species, one occurring in the Indian Peninsula,
New Guinea, and Australia, one in Africa, and one in South America. It is
to this last species that the name Jabiru correctly applies. Furthermore,
there can be no doubt that it is one of the handsomest of its tribe. The
whole plumage is pure white, and the upper-parts are made additionally
resplendent by an indescribable satin-like gloss. The beautiful whiteness
of its plumage is enhanced by the fact that the head and neck, bill and
feet, are jet-black. Some would give the palm of beauty to the AFRICAN
SADDLE-BILLED STORK. Black and white, as in the American form, are the
contrasting "colours"; but the plumage of the body, instead of being pure
white, is plentifully enriched with black, with beautiful purple
reflections.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

FLAMINGOES.

In flight the long neck and legs are fully extended, giving the bird a very
remarkable appearance.]

More or less nearly allied to the Storks are several species familiar
enough to the professional ornithologist, but not very well known
generally. One of the rarest and most interesting of these is the
WHALE-HEADED or SHOE-BILLED STORK of the Nile, remarkable for its enormous
boat-shaped bill. More common but equally interesting are the beautiful
FLAMINGOES. Apart from the brilliancy of their colour, the most noticeable
feature of these birds is the curious beak, which is bent downwards at a
sharp angle, and provided on its inside with horny plates resembling those
of the Ducks and Swans. The tongue of this bird, unlike that of the Stork
Tribe generally, is thick and fleshy, and also resembles that of the duck.

The flamingo is the only member of the Stork Tribe which builds a mud-nest.
Its foundation laid often in as much as 15 inches of water, and rising
above the surface from 6 to 8 inches, with a diameter at the top of 15
inches, it forms a pile of no mean size. Strangely enough, though these
birds are never so happy as when wading "knee" deep in water, yet after the
construction of the nest the incubation of the eggs is delayed so long that
before they are hatched the water has disappeared, leaving a burning plain
of sun-baked mud. On the top of this nest the parent sits with its long
neck neatly curled away among the back-feathers, with its long legs doubled
up, and projecting behind her for some distance beyond the tail. Until
quite recently it was believed that the bird incubated its eggs by sitting
_astride_ the nest, the length of the legs forbidding any other position:
this has now been proved beyond cavil to be an entirely erroneous opinion.

FLAMINGOES.

On account of the swan-like neck and "strainers" along the edges of the
beak, these birds have been regarded as long-legged members of the Duck
Tribe, but they seem more nearly related to the Storks.]

The eggs, two in number, are peculiar in that they are encased in a thick
outer chalky coat, which on removal reveals a greenish-blue shell.

The characteristic crooked beak of the adult is not at all apparent in the
young bird, and only appears as it approaches maturity.

EUROPEAN FLAMINGOES.

These birds breed in the South of France and Spain.]

The huge flocks in which these birds consort are graphically described by
Mr. Abel Chapman as follows: "In herds of 300 to 400, several of which are
often in sight at once, they stand feeding in the open water, all their
heads under, greedily tearing up the grasses and water-plants from the
bottom. On approaching them, which can only be done by extreme caution,
their silence is first broken by the sentries, who commence walking away
with low croaks; then hundreds of necks rise at once to full extent, every
bird gaggling its loudest, as they walk obliquely away, looking back over
their shoulders, as though to take stock of the extent of the danger.
Pushing a few yards forward, up they all rise, and a more beautiful sight
cannot be imagined than the simultaneous spreading of the crimson wings,
flashing against the sky like a gleam of rosy light. In many respects these
birds bear a strong resemblance to geese. Like them, flamingoes feed by
day; and great quantities of grass, etc., are always floating about the
muddy water when a herd has been feeding. Their cry is almost
indistinguishable from the gaggling of geese, and they fly in the same
catenarian formations."

The SPOONBILLS and IBISES also belong to the Stork Tribe. The former are
remarkable chiefly for the strange spoon-shaped bill: one species, a few
hundred years ago, nested in England. This remarkable beak is associated
with a peculiar method of feeding, well described by the late Mr. Wolley.
During the operation, he says, "the beak was passed sideways through the
water, and kept open till something palatable came within its grasp; but
the action by which the bird effected this was most singular; for instead
of turning only its head and neck, it turned its whole body from left to
right and from right to left, like the balance-wheel of a watch; its neck
stretched out and its beak immersed perpendicularly to about half its
depth: this semicircular action was kept up with great vigour and at a
tolerably quick march."

SACRED IBIS.

Sacred to the ancient Egyptians, it is known to the Abyssinians to-day as
"Father John."]

A graphic description by Mr. Alfred Crowley of a visit to the
breeding-haunts of the spoonbill, about fifteen miles from Amsterdam, in
1884, is well worth reproducing here: "Taking a small boat in tow, we were
punted across the open water, over which were flying numbers of
sand-martins, swifts, common and black terns, and black-headed gulls, the
reeds being full of coots, moorhens, sedge- and reed-warblers, etc., and in
the distance we saw, rising above the reeds occasionally, a small spoonbill
or purple heron. On nearing a large mass of reeds, one of the boatmen
struck the side of the punt with the pole, when up rose some fifty
spoonbills and eight or ten purple herons; and as we came closer to the
reeds there were soon hovering over our heads, within easy shot, some 200
of the former, and fifty or sixty of the latter. Strange to say, not a note
or sound escaped from the spoonbills, and only a few croaks from the
herons. On reaching the reeds, we moored our punt, and two of the men,
wading in the mud, took us in the small boat about fifty yards through the
reeds, where we found ourselves surrounded by spoonbills' nests. They were
placed on the mud among the reeds, built about 1 foot or 18 inches high and
2 feet in diameter at the bottom, tapering to 1 foot at the top, where
there was a slight depression, in which lay four eggs, or in most cases
four young birds, many ready to leave the nest, and several ran off as we
approached. In the nests with young there was a great difference in age and
size, one being about a day or so old, and the oldest nearly ready to leave
the nest--some two or three weeks old--so that evidently the birds lay
their four eggs at considerable intervals, and begin to sit on depositing
the first. After wandering about, a matter of difficulty on account of the
mud, we found a clutch of only three eggs, and one of four, which I managed
to blow. We also obtained two clutches of eggs of the purple heron, but
some of the latter had young."

Clarendon's Park.]

The IBISES, though much alike in form, are strangely diverse in colour. One
species was sacred to the ancient Egyptians. The reverence and affection
they showed to this bird, above all others, is probably largely due to its
migrating habits, which obtained in that far past just as they do to-day.
The naturalist Brehm says on this subject: "When the Nile, after being at
its lowest ebb, rose again, and the water assumed a red tinge, then the
ibis appeared in the land of the Pharaohs as a sure guarantee that the
stream--the giver and preserver of life, which the people in their profound
reverence raised to the rank of a god--would once again empty the
well-spring of plenty over the thirsty land. The servant and messenger of
an all-bounteous Deity commanded of a necessity a reverence of a poetic and
distinguished character, by reason of its importance: he too must be a
god."

Another species, the GLOSSY IBIS, occurs sometimes in Britain. Perhaps the
most beautiful of all is the SCARLET IBIS of America, numbers of which can
be seen in the Zoological Gardens of London. On account of the curved,
sickle-shaped bill the Ibises were at one time believed to be related to
the Curlews: this, however, is now known to be quite incorrect.

It was at one time believed that "the ibis [was] adopted as a part of the
arms of the town of Liverpool. This bird is termed a _Liver_, from which
that flourishing town derived its name, and is now standing on the spot
where the _Pool_ was, on the verge of which the _Liver_ was killed." The
arms of the town of Liverpool, however, as Mr. Howard Saunders points out,
are "comparatively modern, and seem to have no reference to the ibis. The
bird which was adopted in the arms of the [extinct] Earls of Liverpool was
described in a former edition of 'Burke's Peerage' as a cormorant, holding
in the beak a branch of seaweed. In the Plantagenet seal of Liverpool,
which is believed to be of the time of King John, the bird has the
appearance of a dove, bearing in its bill a sprig of olive, apparently
intended to refer to the advantages that commerce would derive from peace."

The glossy ibis has been found breeding in colonies of thousands in
Slavonia. The nests are large structures formed of sticks and a few weeds,
never far from the water, and many even, in the colony referred to, were so
near the surface that they appeared to be floating. The eggs, three or four
in number, are of a beautiful greenish blue. The young, while still unable
to fly, climb actively among the branches of the trees in which the nest is
placed, clinging so firmly with the feet as to be removed with difficulty.

GREAT BLUE HERON.

This bird ranges from the Arctic regions to the West Indies and South
America.]


THE HERONS AND BITTERNS.

In the first mentioned of these two groups the COMMON HERON is the best
known in the British Islands. Indeed, there must be few who have not
encountered it in a wild state at some time or another. In suitable spots
it may occasionally be met with standing mid-leg in water on the look-out
for eels and other fish and frogs, a diet varied by an occasional young
bird or small mammal. Sometimes this prey is hunted, so to speak, the bird
walking along with a slow, measured step, striking with lightning rapidity
and wonderful precision the moment its victim is sighted, whilst at others
it stands motionless, as when fishing, striking the instant the
unsuspecting eel or flounder comes within range.

COMMON NIGHT-HERON.

This bird occasionally visits the British Islands.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

YOUNG COMMON HERONS.

These birds have not yet acquired their full plumage.]

From the earliest times until the reign of William IV. the heron was
specially protected by law, being held in high regard both as an object of
sport and a desirable addition to the dinner-table. So late as James I.'s
time an Act was passed making it illegal to shoot with any gun within 600
paces of a heronry. The favourite way of taking the heron was by hawking, a
sport which has furnished material in abundance both for poet and painter.

Herons breed in more or less extensive colonies, the nests--somewhat bulky
structures, made of sticks and lined with twigs--being placed in the tops
of high trees. From four to six is the normal number of eggs, and these are
of a beautiful sea-green colour. The young are thinly clad in long,
hairy-looking down, and for some considerable time are quite helpless.

Similar in appearance to the common heron is the American GREAT BLUE HERON,
though it is by no means the largest of the herons, as its name might seem
to imply. This distinction belongs to the GOLIATH HERON. A native of
Africa, it is remarkable not only for its size, but for an extraordinary
development of long, loose feathers hanging down from the lower part of the
breast, and bearing a strange resemblance to an apron, concealing the upper
part of the legs.

Passing over many species, we pause to descant on the EGRETS. These are
numbered amongst the most unfortunate of birds, and this because of the
gracefulness and beauty of certain parts of the plumage worn during the
breeding-season, which are coveted alike by Eastern magnates and Western
women. The feathers in question are those known as "egrets," or, more
commonly, "ospreys"; and their collection, as Professor Newton points out,
causes some of "the most abominable cruelty practised in the animal world."
The wearing of these feathers can no longer be excused; for Sir William
Flower in England, and Professor W. E. D. Scott in America, have given the
greatest publicity to the horrible barbarities and sickening scenes which
are perpetrated by the men sent to gather in this harvest. The egrets,
however, are not the only victims, as a glance at the milliners' windows
will show, the distorted and mangled bodies of almost every known species
of the smaller birds being therein displayed! Many of those who wear these
"ornaments" offend unwittingly; it is certain that if they realised the
suffering and waste of life that this method of decoration entails they
would eschew any but ostrich feathers for ever.

GREEN HERON.

This is a North American bird of skulking and nocturnal habits.]

The CATTLE-EGRET, better known as the BUFF-BACKED HERON, breeds in the
southern portion of the Spanish Peninsula, where from March to autumn it is
very common in the marshes of Andalusia, thousands congregating there,
herding with the cattle, from the backs of which they may be often seen
picking off the ticks; hence the Spaniards give them a name meaning
"cattle-cleaners."

The NIGHT-HERONS are comparatively small birds, and derive their name from
their habit of turning night into day, waking up only as the shades of
evening fall to hunt for food; only during the breeding-season is this
habit broken through, when they are obliged to hunt for food for their
young during the daytime. They breed in colonies, in bushes or low trees in
the neighbourhood of swamps. In some places they are protected--as, for
instance, round the Great Honam Temple at Canton, where these birds are
held sacred.

Colonel Swinhoe, says Mr. Howard Saunders, describes the nests "as placed
thickly in some venerable banyans, the granite slabs that form the pavement
beneath the trees being bedaubed with the droppings of old and young, while
from the nests arose the chattering cry of the callow broods, for which the
parent birds were catering the whole day long, becoming more active at
sunset. As darkness set in, the noise and hubbub from the trees rose to a
fearful pitch."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

BUFF-BACKED HERON.

This bird habitually picks insects from the backs of cattle.]

In Hungary large numbers of herons and egrets breed together in the
marshes, egrets and night-herons breeding together with the common and
purple herons. Landbeck, an enthusiastic ornithologist, writes of such
heronries: "The clamour in these breeding-places is so tremendous and
singular in its character as almost to defy description; it must be heard
before a person can form any idea of what it is like. At a distance these
hideous noises blend with a confused roar, so as in some way to resemble
the hubbub caused by a party of drunken Hungarian peasants; and it is only
on a nearer approach the separate notes of the two species, the common and
the night-heron, can be distinguished--namely, 'craik' and 'quack,' to
which the notes of the young, 'zek-zek-zek,' ... in different keys, serve
as an accompaniment. When close to, the noise is tremendous and the stench
unbearable. This, together with the sight of dozens of young herons in
every stage of putrefaction and teeming with maggots, is perfectly
sickening, though the contemplation of life and movement in this immense
heronry is a matter of interest to the true ornithologist.... The tops of
the highest trees are usually occupied by the nests of the common heron; a
little lower down is the habitation of the shy and beautiful GREAT EGRET,
while in the forks of the lowest branches the night-heron takes up her
abode. All these species build in one and the same tree, the nests
numbering not infrequently as many as fifteen in a single tree, and yet
peace invariably reigns amongst all these varieties. High over the trees
appears the common heron, laden with booty, announcing his arrival with a
hoarse 'craaich,' when, changing his note to a goose-like 'da-da-da-da,' he
either jerks the provender down the throats of the ever-hungry youngsters
or throws it up before them, when the fish are greedily swallowed, amid a
desperate accompaniment of 'gohé-é-é-é, gohé-é-é-é',' a sound much
resembling the frantic cry of a calf which is being lifted into a farmer's
market-cart. The conduct of the more cautious egret is very different.
Circling far above the nest, she first satisfies herself that no foe is
hidden below before she alights among her family, which are much quieter
and less hasty than their cousins. The night-herons, on the contrary,
approach their nests from all sides, high and low, their crops filled with
frogs, fish, and insects. A deep 'quâk' or 'gowek' announces the arrival of
the old bird already from some distance, to which the young answer, while
feeding, with a note resembling 'queht, queht,' or 'quehaoâheh, quehoehah'.
As soon as the parents have taken their departure the youngsters recommence
their concert, and from every nest uninterrupted cries of 'tzik, tzik,
tzik, tzek-tzek, tzek,' and 'gétt, gétt-gétt,' are the order of the day.
This amusement is varied by the nestlings climbing out among the branches
till they reach the top of the tree, whence they can have a good look-out,
and can see the old birds returning home from a long distance, though they
are in many cases often mistaken in their identity."

A common North American bird is the so-called GREEN HERON, known by many
local aliases, such as "Fly-up-the-Creek," "Chalk-line," and
"Chuckle-head." Seen at short range, its plumage is lustrous and beautiful,
but this disappears as soon as the bird takes wing. The nest is of very
loose construction; and a story is told of one which was such a shaky
concern that every time the old birds jarred it a stick fell off, and the
structure grew smaller and smaller, until the day when the young were ready
to fly there were but three sticks left; finally these parted, and the
little herons found themselves perching on the branch that once held the
nest!


THE BITTERNS.

These are birds of a remarkable type of coloration, adapted to aid their
skulking habits. The coloration partakes so completely of the nature of the
undergrowth among which they dwell, that, aided by certain peculiar habits
described below, they succeed in harmonising so perfectly with their
surroundings as to render themselves invisible to their enemies.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

INDIAN CATTLE-EGRET.

This is a species of buff-backed heron, and earns its name from its habit
of hovering round cattle for the sake of picking off the ticks by which
they are infested.]

The best-known species is the COMMON BITTERN, though this epithet is no
longer applicable, for at the present time it is but an occasional visitant
to Britain. Once it was plentiful enough, as the frequent references both
in prose and poetry bear witness. These references have been inspired
mainly by its very peculiar note, made apparently only during the
breeding-season. This sound is variously described as "booming,"
"bellowing," and "bumping," and many are the theories which have been
invented to account for its origin. Thomson, in "The Seasons," says that it
is made whilst the beak is thrust into the mud:--

  The bittern knows his time, with bill ingulf'd
  To shake the sounding marsh.

Chaucer, that it is caused whilst it is immersed under water; and Dryden
represents it as made by thrusting the bill into a reed. Mr. J. E. Harting
is one of the few who have actually watched the bird during the production
of the sound, and from him we gather that it is made by expelling the air
from the throat whilst the head is held vertically upwards.

The protective coloration and the peculiar habits associated therewith have
only recently been recognised. These birds, when threatened, do not take
flight, but immediately bring the body and the long neck and pointed head
into one vertical line, and remain absolutely motionless so long as the
cause of alarm persists. The peculiar coloration of the body harmonises so
perfectly with the surrounding undergrowth, that, as just remarked,
detection is well-nigh impossible. Although the pattern and tone of the
coloration vary in the various species of bittern--which occur all over the
world--this principle of protection obtains in all.

The drainage of the fens is answerable for the extinction of the bittern in
England.

We would draw special attention to the great length of the feathers on the
neck, which, when the bird is excited, are extended on either side to form
an enormous feather shield. This is admirably shown in the photograph
below, which represents a bittern preparing to strike. It is a curious fact
that, when extended, the hind part of the neck is protected only by a thin
coat of down. When the excitement has passed, the elongated feathers fall
again, and, curling round the unprotected area, give the bird the
appearance of having a perfectly normally clothed neck.

A wounded bittern will strike at either man or dog, and is extremely
dangerous, owing to the sharpness of its dagger-like bill. If a dog
advances on one not entirely disabled, the bird immediately turns itself
upon its back, and fights with beak and claws, after the fashion of a
wounded hawk or owl. Owing to the way in which the neck can be tucked up,
by throwing it into a series of curves, and then suddenly extended, great
danger attends the approach of the unwary.

The bittern is by no means particular in its choice of food, small mammals,
birds, lizards, frogs, fishes, and beetles being alike palatable. The
writer remembers taking from the gullet and stomach of one of these birds
no less than four water-voles, three of which had apparently been killed
only just before it was shot, for the process of digestion had hardly
begun.

On migration these birds appear to travel in flocks of considerable size,
since Captain Kelham reports having seen as many as fifty together high up
in the air, when between Alexandria and Cairo. Curiously enough, they flew
like "a gaggle" of geese--in the form of a V; but every now and then he
noticed they, for some reason or other, got into great confusion.

At one time the flesh of the bittern was much esteemed as food for the
table, being likened in taste and colour to the leveret, with some of the
flavour of wild-fowl. Sir Thomas Browne, who flourished during the middle
of the seventeenth century, says that young bitterns were considered better
eating than young herons.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. L. Bonhote, Esq._

COMMON BITTERN.

Preparing to attack (side view).]

In the fourteenth century it bred in considerable numbers in the fens of
Cambridgeshire, and was so highly esteemed as a bird for the table that the
taking of its eggs was forbidden. At a court-baron of the Bishop of Ely,
according to Mr. J. E. Harting, held at Littleport in the eleventh year of
the reign of Edward II., several people were fined for taking the eggs of
the bittern and carrying them out of the fen, to the great destruction of
the birds. Decreasing steadily in numbers, the bittern continued to breed
in Britain till the middle of the nineteenth century, one of the last nests
being taken in Norfolk in 1868.

EGYPTIAN PELICAN.

In the Pelicans the two sexes are coloured alike.]


THE PELICAN TRIBE.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

CRESTED PELICAN.

This bird derives its name from the curiously curled feathers on the top of
the head and nape of the neck.]

The members of the Pelican Tribe may be readily distinguished from other
living birds by the fact that all their toes are united in a common fold of
skin or web. In the Ducks and other web-footed birds only the front toes
are so united.

The Pelican Tribe embraces several apparently dissimilar forms, whose only
claim to be grouped together, judged from a superficial point of view, lies
in the fact that they possess the peculiar type of foot above mentioned.
With the general appearance of the Pelican itself probably every one is
familiar, but we had better mention here that the other representatives of
the group with which we have now to deal are the Cormorants and Gannets,
common on the British coasts, and the less-known Darters, Frigate-birds,
and Tropic-birds; these, as we know from their anatomy, are all closely
allied forms, and with the Pelicans make up a somewhat isolated group whose
nearest allies appear to be the members of the Stork Tribe.

The PELICAN figures largely in ecclesiastical heraldry as the type of
maternal tenderness. Tradition has it that the bird, in admonishing its
young, occasionally did so with such violence as to slay them. Remorse
immediately following, the distracted parent drew blood from its own
breast, and therewith sprinkled the victims of its wrath, which thereupon
became restored to life again. The exhaustion following on this loss of
blood was so great that the young had perforce to leave the nest to procure
food for themselves and the sinking parent. If any, through lack of filial
affection, refused to aid in this good work, the mother, on recovering
strength, drove them from her presence, but the faithful children she
permitted to follow her wherever she went.

One of the most remarkable features of the pelican is the pouch which hangs
suspended from the under side of the beak. This is capable of great
distension, and is used, when fishing, as a sort of bag-net, of which the
upper jaw serves as the lid. The young are fed by the female, which,
pressing her well-filled pouch against her breast, opens her mouth and
allows them to take their fill therefrom.

Pelicans display great sagacity when fishing, a flock often combining to
form a horseshoe, and, driving the fish into a mass, take their fill. This
method, of course, is only possible when fishing in the estuaries of rivers
or lakes, where the fish can be "rounded up," so to speak. Clumsy as the
pelican looks, it is yet capable of wonderful powers of flight; indeed, it
shares the honour with the vultures, storks, and adjutants as an expert in
the peculiar form of flight known as "soaring."

A North American species of pelican is remarkable in that during the
breeding-season the beak is ornamented with a peculiar horny excrescence,
which is shed as soon as that period is over.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

YOUNG AUSTRALIAN PELICAN.

Pelicans, like gannets and cormorants, are hatched perfectly naked and
quite blind.]

Pelicans are natives of the tropical and temperate regions of the Old and
New Worlds, and live in flocks often numbering many thousands. The nest is
placed on the ground, and therein are deposited two white eggs. The young
are helpless for some time after hatching.

In all some six-and-thirty species of CORMORANTS are known to science, of
which two are commonly to be met with round the British coasts, one of
which also travels inland to establish itself on such lakes and rivers as
may afford it support.

In various parts of the world cormorants are taken when young and trained
to catch fish: sometimes for sport, or--as in China--to furnish a
livelihood for their owners. At one time the Master of the Cormorants was
one of the officers in the Royal Household of England, the post having been
created in 1611 by James I. The method of hunting is as follows:--After
fastening a ring around the neck, the bird is cast off into the water, and,
diving immediately, makes its way beneath the surface with incredible
speed, and, seizing one fish after another, rises in a short space of time
with its mouth full and throat distended by the fish, which it has been
unable to swallow by reason of the restraining ring. With these captures it
dutifully returns to its keeper, who deftly removes the fish, and either
returns the bird to the water, or, giving it a share of the spoil, restores
it to its perch.

Cormorants nest either in trees or on the ground; they lay from four to six
eggs, and the young feed themselves by thrusting their heads far down the
parents' throats and helping themselves to the half-digested fish which
they find there.

The cormorant has a certain sinister appearance equalled by no other bird,
so that its introduction in Milton's "Paradise Lost" (Book IV., 194) seems
particularly appropriate. Satan, it will be remembered, is likened to a
cormorant:--

  So clomb this first grand Thief into God's fold
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  Thence up he flew, and in the Tree of Life,
  The middle tree and highest there that grew,
  Sat like a cormorant.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

YOUNG PELICANS.

Young pelicans never develop long down-feathers, like gannets and
frigate-birds.]

The curious bottle-green plumage, green eyes, long hooked beak, and head
surmounted by a crest of the smaller sea-loving representative of the two
British species were doubtless familiar enough to Milton before blindness
overtook him.

Some of our readers may have made the acquaintance of the cormorant's
nearest ally, the DARTER, or SNAKE-NECK, in the Fish-house at the
Zoological Gardens of London. For the sake of those who have not, we may
say that the darter may be described as a long-necked cormorant, with
somewhat lighter plumage. The head is small and flat, and armed with a
pointed, dagger-like bill, whose edges are finely toothed, with needle-like
points projecting backwards. The neck is very long and slender; hence its
name of Snake-neck. Furthermore, it is remarkable for a very strange
"kink," formed by a peculiar arrangement of the neck-bones--an arrangement
intimately associated with its peculiar method of capturing its prey,
which, as with the cormorant, is pursued under water. How dexterously this
is done may be seen any day in the Fish-house at the Zoological Gardens,
where, as we have already mentioned, these birds are kept. At feeding-time
they are turned loose into a large tank into which a number of small fish
have been placed. The birds dive as soon as they reach the water, and with
surprising speed chase their prey till within short range. Then, by a
sudden bayonet-like lunge, made possible by the peculiar "kink" in the
neck, a victim is transfixed, brought to the surface, released from the
bill by a series of sudden jerks, tossed into the air, and dexterously
caught and swallowed.

CORMORANT.

In the spring a slight crest is developed, and a white patch appears on the
thigh.]

The darter is found in Africa, India, the Malay region, Australia, and
South America, frequenting the banks of rivers, lakes, and swamps,
sometimes singly, sometimes in pairs or in immense flocks.

Very different from either of the foregoing species, both in build and
coloration, is the GANNET. In its habits it is also different. The adult
bird is about the size of a goose, white in colour, and armed with a
powerful pointed bill. The young have a quite distinct plumage, being deep
brown, speckled with white, this livery being worn for nearly three years.

The greater part of a gannet's lifetime seems to be spent upon the wing, a
fact which implies a very different method of feeding from that followed by
the cormorant and darter; and this is actually the case. Preying upon
shoals of herring, mackerel, sprats, or pilchards, the birds, flying singly
or in flocks, as soon as the fish are discovered, rise, soar in circles to
such a height as experience shows best calculated to carry them by a
downward motion to the required depth, and then, partially closing the
wings, plunge upon their prey, and rarely without success, the time which
elapses between the plunge and the immersion being about fifteen seconds. A
flock of gannets feeding is a really wonderful sight, and can be witnessed
in many places around the British coasts, for the gannet is one of the very
common British birds. The pilchard-fishermen off the Cornish coast learn
when the shoals are at hand, and the direction in which they are
travelling, by the actions of these birds. A very cruel experiment is
sometimes practised upon the gannet, based upon its well-known method of
fishing. A herring is tied to a beam and set adrift, and the bird, not
noticing the trap, plunges with its usual velocity upon the fish, with the
result that it is killed instantly by the shock of the contact.

FRIGATE-BIRDS AT HOME.

The feathers of frigate-birds are used for head-dresses in the Pacific
Islands.]

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

YOUNG GANNETS, FIRST YEAR.

The plumage at this stage is very dark brown, each feather being tipped
with white.]

Gannets breed in colonies of thousands on the islands off the east and west
coasts of Scotland. They lay but a single egg, in a nest composed of
seaweed deposited in inaccessible crags of precipitous cliffs. The young
are at first naked; later they become clothed with long white down. "At one
time," says Mr. Howard Saunders, "young gannets were much esteemed as food,
from 1,500 to 2,000 being taken in a season during the month of August.
They are hooked up, killed, and flung into the sea, where a boat is waiting
to pick up the bodies. These are plucked, cleaned, and half roasted, after
which they are sold at from eightpence to a shilling each.... The fat is
boiled down into oil, and the feathers, after being well baked, are used
for stuffing beds, about a hundred birds producing a stone of feathers."

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

GANNET, SECOND YEAR.

The white plumage of the neck is just beginning to appear.]

Gannets present one or two structural peculiarities of sufficient interest
to mention here. In most birds, it will be remembered, the nostrils open on
each side of the beak; but in the gannet no trace of true nostrils remains;
and the same may almost be said of the cormorant and darter. In gannets,
however, a slight indication of their sometime existence remains, though
the nostril itself no longer serves as an air-passage; and these birds are
compelled to breathe through the mouth. Again, the tongue, like the
nostrils, has also been reduced to a mere vestige. Stranger still is the
fact that immediately under the skin there lies an extensive system of
air-cells of large size, which can be inflated or emptied at will. Many of
these cells dip down between the muscles of the body, so that the whole
organism is pervaded with air-cells, all of which are in connection with
the lungs.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

GANNET, FULL PLUMAGE.

The fully adult plumage is not attained till the bird is three years old.]

The FRIGATE- and TROPIC-BIRDS, which now remain to be described, are
probably much less familiar to our readers than the foregoing species.

[Illustration: _Photo by Valentine & Sons, Ltd._]     [_Dundee._

GANNETS ON THE BASS ROCK.

The Bass Rock is the only breeding-station of the gannet on the eastern
coast of the British Islands.]

FRIGATE-BIRDS are remarkable in more ways than one. To begin with, their
general appearance may be described as that of a small, long-winged,
fork-tailed albatross, mounted upon particularly diminutive legs, so short
as to do little more than raise the body off the ground. Their flight is
wonderfully graceful, and capable of being sustained for considerable
periods; for, like the gannets, they pass most of their time on the wing.
They feed upon surface-fish, which they capture from the surface of the
water without alighting, or upon fish which they take from the gannets of
the neighbourhood.

Frigate-birds build their nests in trees, on low bushes, or on the ground,
and sometimes upon ledges of precipitous cliffs. The nest is a loose
structure composed of sticks, and its construction is accompanied by much
pilfering from one another. Only a single egg is laid.

About the beginning of January the male acquires a very remarkable pouch of
brilliant scarlet skin, which hangs beneath the beak. Frigate-birds are
found all over the world within the tropics.

The TROPIC-BIRDS, or BOATSWAIN-BIRDS, as they are sometimes called, are
more like gulls or the heavier species of terns in general appearance, and
in no way resemble superficially the forms with which they are associated,
save in the fact that all the toes are enclosed in the same web. A study of
their anatomy, however, leaves little doubt that these birds are really
members of the Pelican Tribe.

Either pure white, relieved with black, or of a beautiful apricot-yellow,
with similar black markings, with a powerful bill and long tapering tail,
the tropic-bird is one of the most beautiful of sea-birds. There are
altogether about six species of tropic-birds, distributed over the Pacific
and Indian Oceans. They nest in hollows of cliffs or holes in trees, and
lay a single egg, which bears some resemblance to that of a kestrel.

CHAPTER VIII.

_SCREAMERS, DUCKS, GEESE, AND SWANS._


Familiar as are most of our readers with all save the first mentioned of
these birds, yet few probably suspect how great a wealth of forms this
group displays. All are more or less aquatic in their habits, of heavy
build, with long necks and small heads, short legs, and short wings and
tails. The young are hatched covered with a peculiar kind of down, which
more nearly resembles that of the Ostrich Tribe than the down of other
birds, and they run about or accompany their parents to the water either
immediately or a few hours after hatching. Several species have become
domesticated, and in some cases have given rise to peculiar breeds, whilst
many are much in demand for the purpose of enlivening ornamental waters.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

CRESTED SCREAMER, OR CHAKA.

The Crested and Horned Screamers are the only members of the family without
webbed feet.]

The least-known members of the group are the very remarkable and extremely
interesting SCREAMERS of South America, of which there are three species.
These are large birds, presenting some resemblances to the Game-birds on
the one hand and the Geese on the other. Not only the beak, but the skull,
in certain characters, recalls that of the Game-birds. The body may be
described as goose-like, but in the longer legs and enormous toes, which
are not connected by a web, these birds recall the Megapodes, or
Mound-builders (page 411).

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

AYLESBURY DUCK.

This is one of the most esteemed of all domesticated breeds.]

The screamers are generally regarded as primitive members of the group with
which they are now associated; but in many respects they are quite
peculiar. Not the least interesting of their habits is the great
predilection they observe for soaring in the air at immense altitudes,
uttering the while the curious cry to which they owe their name. Several
birds often do this at once. Yet stranger is the fact that they not seldom
gather together in vast flocks to sing in concert. Mr. Hudson, for
instance, states that the species known as the CRESTED SCREAMER on one
occasion surprised him by "an awful and overpowering burst of 'melody,'"
which saluted him from half a million of voices at an out-of-the-way spot
in the pampas one evening at nine o'clock; and, again, once at noon he
heard flock after flock take up their song round the entire circuit of a
certain lake, each flock waiting its turn to sing, and only stopping when
the duty had been performed.

Like the gannet, these birds are richly supplied with air-cells between the
body and the skin, and between many of the muscles; so highly are these
cells developed, that it is said a crackling sound is emitted when pressure
is applied to the skin.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. W. McLellan_]     [_Highbury._

POCHARD.

This is one of the diving-ducks.]

The wings of these birds are armed each with a pair of powerful and sharp
spurs, recalling those of certain of the Plover Tribe (page 421), though in
the latter only one spur is present on each wing.

The division of the remainder of this group into Ducks, Geese, and Swans is
generally recognised, but no hard-and-fast line can yet be drawn between
the several sections. We must regard them as representing adaptations to
peculiar modes of life, which appear to be most marked in the duck-like
forms. These may be divided into FRESH-WATER DUCKS, SALT-WATER DUCKS,
SPINY-TAILED DUCKS, and MERGANSERS.

Of the FRESH-WATER DUCKS, the most familiar is the WILD-DUCK, or MALLARD.
This is a resident British bird, and also the parent of the domesticated
stock, which frequently closely resembles the wild form. In this species,
as with the majority of the fresh-water ducks, the males wear a distinctive
livery; but the males for a few weeks during the summer assume more or less
completely the livery of the female, a process aptly described as going
into "eclipse." The assumption of the female dress at this season is
necessary, since it harmonises completely with the surrounding foliage, and
so effectually conceals the bird at a time when it is peculiarly helpless;
for, as with all birds, the quills or flight-feathers are cast off by the
process known as moulting once a year, but instead of being replaced in
pairs, and the flight remaining unaffected, they are shed all at once, so
that escape from enemies must be sought by concealment.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

EIDER-DUCK.

It is the down of this bird which is so much in demand for quilts.]

Usually among birds the male has the more powerful voice, but with the
mallard and its allies the reverse is the case, the female giving forth the
loud familiar "quack, quack," whilst the note of the male sounds like a
feeble attempt to answer its mate, but smothered by a cold in the head.
This peculiar and characteristic subdued voice is associated with a
remarkable bulb-shaped bony enlargement at the bottom of the windpipe, just
where it branches off to the right and left lungs, the female being without
this swelling.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

SHELDRAKE.

The female bird is just entering her nest at the bottom of a long burrow.]

The nest is composed of grass, and lined with down plucked by the female
from her own breast, with the sole object, it is generally believed, of
keeping the eggs warm; but it is possible that the down is removed as much
for the sake of bringing the warm surface of the body in closer contact
with the eggs. The site chosen for the nest is exceedingly varied; usually
the nest is placed on the ground and near the water, but sometimes in a
hedgerow or in a wood, and occasionally in trees, and instances are on
record where the deserted nests of hawks and crows have been appropriated.
At such times the young seem to be brought to the ground by the parent,
which carries them down in her bill. It is some time before the wings of
the young birds are big enough to carry them; indeed, they are quite full
grown in so far as the body is concerned. At this stage they are known as
"flappers." Advantage was at one time taken of their helplessness in the
"sport" known as "flapper-shooting." On other occasions numbers of people
assembled and "beat" a vast tract of country, driving these young flappers
before them to a given spot where nets were placed, in which as many as 150
dozen have been taken at one time. Fortunately this practice has been
abolished by Act of Parliament.

Several very distinct domesticated breeds of ducks have been derived from
the mallard. The commonest breed differs but little, save in its great
size, from the wild parent form, but the most esteemed are those known as
the ROUEN and AYLESBURY. The PENGUIN-DUCK is the most aberrant and the
ugliest of these breeds, having a peculiarly upright, awkward carriage, and
very small wings.

The SALT-WATER DUCKS, or DIVING-DUCKS, are for the most part of a heavier
build than the foregoing species, and many are of a sombre coloration. All
the species are expert divers, and in consequence have the legs, which are
short, placed far backwards, and this causes them to assume a more upright
carriage when on land. The curious bony bulb at the base of the windpipe
found in the fresh-water species becomes in the salt-water forms greatly
enlarged, and its walls incompletely ossified, leaving large spaces to be
filled by peculiarly delicate sheets of membrane. The majority of the
species in this section frequent the open sea, but some occur inland.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

PARADISE-DUCKS.

This species is a native of New Zealand, where the photograph was taken.
The bird on the right with the white head is the female.]

One of the most useful, and at the same time most ornamental, of this
section is the EIDER-DUCK, the male in full plumage being a truly
magnificent bird: the female, as in the majority of ducks, is clad in sober
colours. In Iceland and Norway the eider-duck is strictly protected, a fine
being imposed for killing it during the breeding-season, or even for firing
a gun near its haunts. This most unusual care is, however, by no means of a
disinterested kind, but is extended solely that certain privileged persons
may rob the birds of their eggs and the down on which they rest, the latter
being the valuable eiderdown so much in demand for bed-coverlets and other
purposes. "The eggs and down," says Professor Newton, "are taken at
intervals of a few days by the owners of the 'eider-fold,' and the birds
are thus kept depositing both during the whole season.... Every duck is
ultimately allowed to hatch an egg or two to keep up the stock." Mr. W. C.
Sheppard gives an interesting account of a visit to an eider-colony on an
island off the coast of Iceland. "On landing," he says, "the ducks and
their nests were everywhere. Great brown ducks sat upon their nests in
masses, and at every step started from under our feet. It was with
difficulty we avoided treading on some of the nests. On the coast of the
opposite shore was a wall built of large stones ... about 3 feet high and
of considerable thickness. At the bottom, on both sides of it, alternate
stones had been left out, so as to form a series of square apartments for
the ducks to nest in. Almost every apartment was occupied.... The house
itself was a marvel. The earthen walls that surrounded it, and the window
embrasures, were occupied by ducks. On the ground the house was fringed
with ducks. On the turf slopes of its roof we could see ducks, and a duck
sat on the door-scraper. The grassy banks had been cut into square patches,
about 18 inches having been removed, and each hollow had been filled with
ducks. A windmill was infested, and so were all the outhouses, mounds,
rocks, and crevices. The ducks were everywhere. Many were so tame that we
could stroke them on their nests, and the good lady told us that there was
scarcely a duck on the island that would not allow her to take its eggs
without flight or fear."

The nest is composed externally of seaweed, and lined with down, which is
plucked by the female from her breast as incubation proceeds, till
eventually it completely conceals the eggs. Each nest yields about
one-sixth of a pound, and is worth, on the spot, from twelve to fifteen
shillings a pound.

The POCHARDS, SCAUPS, GOLDEN-EYES, and SCOTERS are relatives of the
eider-duck; but since all resemble the latter in their general mode of
life, we need not consider them here.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

CAPE BARREN GOOSE.

This bird is a native of South-east Australia and Tasmania, and remarkable
for its short beak.]

The MERGANSERS and SMEWS, to which reference has been made, differ markedly
from all the ducks so far considered in the peculiar formation of the bill,
which is relatively long and narrow, with its edges armed with sharp,
tooth-like processes projecting backwards towards the back of the mouth.
These processes are really only horny spines, and have no relation to
teeth, although they are used, as teeth would be, for holding slippery
prey, such as fish, which form the greater part of the diet of these birds.

So far, in all the ducks which we have considered, the male differs
conspicuously from the female in plumage; but in the forms we are now about
to describe both sexes are coloured alike.

The first is the COMMON SHELDRAKE, which seems to lie somewhere on the
borderland between the Ducks and the Geese. It is a very beautiful bird,
conspicuously marked with broad bands of orange-chestnut, white, and black.
The beak being coral-red in colour, and further ornamented by a peculiar
fleshy knob at its base, serves to set off the glossy bottle-green colour
of the head and neck. As appears to be invariably the case where both sexes
are coloured alike, the female builds her nest in a hole, generally a
rabbit-burrow, whilst the young have a distinct livery, duller in tone than
that of the parent. The female sheldrake breeds in Britain, and may be
frequently seen at sea flying in small parties, which have been likened to
a flock of butterflies.

The GEESE include birds of somewhat conspicuous coloration, besides a
considerable number of more subdued aspect. The sexes are distinguished by
different names, the female being known as the Goose, the male as the
Gander, whilst the young is the Gosling. As we have already mentioned,
there is no hard-and-fast line to be drawn between the three sections of
this group. The Ducks are connected by the Sheldrakes with the Geese,
through the Spur-winged Goose, the Egyptian and Orinoco Geese, and certain
other species which cannot be alluded to on this occasion.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN PYGMY GOOSE.

The pygmy geese are expert divers.]

The SPUR-WINGED GEESE, of which there are two species, are African birds,
and derive their name from the long spur seated on the wing.

A still more remarkable form is the HALF-WEBBED GOOSE, so called from the
fact that its feet are only partially webbed. It has a black-and-white
plumage, a hooked beak, and a large warty prominence on the front of the
head. It spends most of its time perched on the branches of the Australian
tea-trees, and rarely enters the water. The windpipe is peculiar, being
coiled in several folds between the skin and the breast-muscles.

From these peculiar forms we pass to the true geese. The largest living
species is the CHINESE or GUINEA-GOOSE of Eastern Siberia, regarded as the
stock from which the domesticated geese of Eastern countries have been
derived.

European domesticated geese have been derived from the GREY or GREY-LAG
GOOSE, a species at one time exceedingly common in England, breeding in
considerable numbers in the fen districts, where the young were frequently
taken and reared with the large flock of domesticated geese commonly kept
at that time for the sake of their feathers. The grey-lag goose, however,
has long ceased to breed in England, though a few still nest in Scotland.
The most important breeds derived from the grey-lag are the TOULOUSE and
EMDEN. Other British species are the BEAN-GOOSE, PINK-FOOTED and
WHITE-FRONTED GEESE, and the "BLACK" BRENT and BARNACLE-GEESE, in all of
which the sexes are precisely similar in coloration and subdued in tone.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

BLACK-NECKED SWAN.

The fleshy knob at the base of the bill is of a bright red colour.]

In the New World some very beautiful white geese are found, which are still
more interesting in that the females have a different coloration. These are
the KELP- and UPLAND-GEESE of Patagonia and the Falklands. The female of
the kelp-goose is brownish black above and black barred with white below,
whilst the female of the upland-goose is rufous and black in colour. The
latter may be seen in London parks.

Lastly, we have a few species known from their small size as PYGMY GEESE of
Australia, India, and Africa. Perhaps the best known is the Indian species,
called the COTTON-TEAL. They are tiny birds, resembling small ducks rather
than geese, and dive admirably, a feat which the larger species do not
perform.

[Illustration: _Photo by the Duchess of Bedford_]     [_Woburn Abbey._

TRUMPETER- AND WHOOPER-SWANS.

The trumpeter is the bird in the foreground; the whooper is remarkable for
its musical note, resembling the word "whoop" quickly repeated.]

The SWANS are linked with the Geese through a very beautiful South American
species, known as the COSCOROBA SWAN. It is the smallest of all the swans,
pure white in colour, save the tips of the greater wing-quills, which are
black, and the coral-red bill and feet.

Of all the swans, probably the best known is the MUTE SWAN, the
semi-domesticated descendants of which are so common on ornamental waters.
For hundreds of years the latter were jealously guarded, none but the
larger freeholders being allowed to keep them, and then not without a
licence from the Crown; with this licence was coupled an obligation to mark
each swan with a particular mark, cut with a knife or other instrument
through the skin of the beak, whereby ownership might be established.

It would seem that these swans and their descendants were not derived from
the native wild stock, but were introduced into England, it is said, from
Cyprus by Richard I. At the present day large "swanneries" have almost
ceased to exist. Perhaps the largest is that of the Earl of Ilchester, at
Abbotsbury, near Weymouth. In 1878 between 1,300 and 1,400 swans were to be
seen there at one time, but latterly the number has been reduced to about
half.

Although swans do not perhaps stand so high in the general esteem as table
delicacies as with our forefathers, there are yet many who appreciate the
flesh of this bird; but the St. Helen's Swan-pit at Norwich is the only
place in England where they are systematically fattened for the table. Here
from 70 to 200 cygnets--as the young swans are called--caught in the
neighbouring rivers, are placed early in August, and fed upon cut grass and
barley till Christmas, when they are fit for table, weighing, when
"dressed," about 15 lbs., and fetching, if purchased alive at the pit,
about two guineas each. The pit is constructed of brickwork, and is about
74 feet long, 32 feet wide, and 6 feet deep--the water, admitted from the
river, being about 2 feet deep. The food is placed in floating troughs. The
birds, "when so disposed," says Mr. Southwell, "leave the water by walking
up a sloping stage, and thus obtain access to a railed-in enclosure, where
they may rest and preen themselves."

The beautiful swan-like carriage, so familiar in the floating bird, seems
to belong only to the mute swan, the other species of white swans carrying
the neck more or less straight, and keeping the wings closely folded to the
body.

No greater anomaly could at one time have been imagined than a BLACK SWAN.
For centuries it was considered to be an impossibility. We owe the
discovery of such a bird to the Dutch navigator Willem de Vlaming, who,
more than 200 years ago, captured the first specimen at the mouth of what
is now known, in consequence, as the Swan River. A year after their capture
accounts reached England through the burgomaster of Amsterdam, and these
were published by the Royal Society in 1698. The bird is now fairly common
on ornamental waters, where its sooty-black plumage, set off by pure white
quill-feathers and coral-red bill, contrasts strongly with the typical
snow-white mute swan, generally kept with it.

Equally interesting is the handsome BLACK-NECKED SWAN of South America. In
this species the plumage is pure white, save that of the neck, which is
black. The distribution of this species is practically the same as that of
the Coscoroba swan. Breeding freely in confinement, it has become a fairly
common bird on ornamental waters. It shares with the mute swan the
reputation of gracefulness when afloat, swimming with the neck curved and
wings raised.

AUSTRALIAN BLACK SWANS AND CYGNETS.

The cygnets are light-coloured, like those of the white swans]

CHAPTER IX.

_BIRDS OF PREY AND OWLS._


BIRDS OF PREY.

At one time the boundaries of this group were much larger than now, for
within them were included at least one form which has since proved to
belong to the Crane Tribe: we allude to the Seriema (page 428), and also to
the Owls. This classification was based on the very remarkable superficial
resemblance to the typical birds of prey which those forms bear. Modern
ornithologists regard as birds of prey only the forms known as the New
World Vultures, the Secretary-bird, and the Falcons, Eagles, Vultures,
Buzzards, and the numerous smaller forms commonly classed as "Hawks."

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

CONDOR.

The habit of standing with the wings expanded is a very common one with
these birds.]


THE NEW WORLD VULTURES.

These may be distinguished from their distant relatives of the Old World by
the fact that the nostrils are not divided from one another by a partition,
and by their much weaker feet. The head and neck in all, as in the true
vultures, is more or less bare, and, furthermore, is often very brilliantly
coloured, in which last particular these birds differ from the typical
vultures.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

CONDOR.

The bare skin of the head and neck is of a dark purple colour, the ruff
encircling the neck being of pure white down-feathers.]

One of the most important members of the group is the CONDOR, one of the
largest of flying birds, and when on the wing the most majestic. "When the
condors," says Darwin, "are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot,
their flight is beautiful. Except when rising off the ground, I do not
recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings. Near Lima I
watched several for nearly half an hour, without once taking off my eyes;
they moved in large curves, sweeping in circles, descending and ascending,
without giving a single flap." One which he shot measured, from tip to tip
of the fully expanded wings, 8½ feet.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

KING-VULTURE.

The fleshy crest on the beak is developed in the females as well as in the
males.]

The condor, like its smaller relatives, hunts by sight, and not, as was at
one time believed, by smell, feeding on the dead bodies of guanacos which
have died a natural death or been killed by pumas, and upon other dead
animals. In the neighbourhood where sheep and goats are kept, they are much
dreaded, as they will attack the young kids and lambs. The flock-owners on
this account wage constant war against them, capturing them by enclosing a
carcase within a narrow space, and when the condors are gorged galloping up
on horseback and killing them, for when this bird has not space to run it
cannot rise from the ground. Sometimes the trees on which they roost are
marked, and when night falls a man climbs the tree and captures them with a
noose, for they are very heavy sleepers.

The condor ranges from the Andes of Ecuador, Peru, and Chili southwards to
the Rio Negro on the east coast of Patagonia. It lays two large white eggs
on a shelf of bare rock projecting from precipitous cliffs, and the young
are said to be unable to fly till after they are a year old. As will be
seen in the photographs, the head of the male is crowned by a bare, fleshy
caruncle, which, like the surrounding bare skin, is of a dull reddish
colour: lower down the neck is a frill of pure white down, which forms a
conspicuous contrast with the glossy black plumage of the rest of the body
and wings.

The KING-VULTURE is a much smaller bird, but the bare parts of the head are
much more brilliantly, even gaudily coloured, the combinations being
orange, purple, and crimson. The plumage is creamy white and black. It is a
comparatively rare bird, and but little is known concerning its breeding
habits. The female is much more soberly clad than her mate. The
king-vulture has a more northerly range than the condor, extending from
Brazil to Mexico, Texas, and Florida.

BLACK VULTURES.

When disturbed, these birds eject foul-smelling matter.]

The commonest of the New World vultures is the TURKEY-BUZZARD, which is
found over the whole of temperate and tropical America. Of the four species
commonly known as Turkey-buzzards, three are exclusively South
American--the fourth ranges as far north as New York and British Columbia,
and in the Southern and Middle United States is very common, perambulating
the streets or perching on the house-tops.

[Illustration: _Photo by Robert D. Carson, Esq._]     [_Philadelphia._

CALIFORNIAN VULTURE.

The bare parts of the head are of a brick-red colour.]

Other species are the small BLACK VULTURE, a dull, uninteresting-looking
bird, and the CALIFORNIAN VULTURE. This latter is a large species, and in
the expanse of wing may even exceed the condor. At one time its
extermination seemed certain, owing to its falling a victim to the poisoned
meat laid out by the stock-keepers for carnivorous mammals, but in the more
barren and inaccessible regions it appears to be on the increase.


THE SECRETARY-BIRD.

The second of the three main divisions into which the Birds of Prey are
divided is reserved for the SECRETARY-BIRD. This bird derives its name from
the crest of long feathers which bear a fanciful resemblance to the
quill-pens a clerk is supposed to stick above his ear. It differs from all
the other members of the Hawk Tribe in the exceedingly long legs, which in
the young are said to be so fragile as to fracture if the bird is suddenly
alarmed. It feeds chiefly on insects and reptiles, especially snakes, for
which last it seems to have a special liking. It attacks even the most
venomous species, striking at them with its powerful wings and pounding
them with its feet, jumping upon them with great force, till rendered
helpless, when they are at once swallowed head-foremost. On account of its
great value as a snake-eater it has been accorded special protection,
though unfortunately there is a tendency on the part of English settlers to
relax this, on account of the fact that it will occasionally eat animals
coming within the scope of "game." Valuable as the latter may be, there yet
seems no justification for such a course.

The secretary-bird, which is a South African species, though extending
northwards as far as Abyssinia, builds a huge nest of sticks in low bushes,
under which will often be found numerous nests of the Cape sparrow,
apparently the only available site on the veldt, where bushes are scarce.
Here the sparrows are efficiently protected from the icy winds which so
frequently sweep across this region, and apparently suffer no fear of
personal violence from the fierce owners of the domicile above them. When
sitting, the female secretary is fed by her mate. The young do not appear
to leave the nest for five or six months. They are frequently taken from
the nest and brought up as household pets, becoming not only very tame, but
exceedingly useful.


THE EAGLE AND FALCON TRIBE.

From the perplexing wealth of species displayed among the forms herein
bracketed together, we can only select a few examples, which embrace,
however, all the more important and interesting forms.

Beginning with the more lowly, we start with those members of small or
medium size known as KITES, and as an example of the group take the species
known in the British Islands as the KITE, or GLEAD. In former days this
bird was extremely common in England, being found in numbers not only in
the rural districts, but in London itself, where, as old records of the
fifteenth century show, it occurred in such numbers near London Bridge as
to excite the wonder of foreigners visiting the city. These birds found an
abundance of food in the garbage of the streets, and also of the Thames
itself--"an observation," remarks Mr. Finn, "which throws a lurid light
upon the city sanitation."

In the days of falconry the kite was royal game, not, however, by legal
enactment, but by reason of the fact that none but specially trained
falcons could secure a prey with such wonderful powers of flight.
Consequently the price of a falcon which had attained this degree of skill
was beyond the purse of any but a king.

Save on the wing, the kite is not a handsome bird, its general colour being
of a pale reddish brown; but those who have had the good fortune to watch
its flight are one and all impressed. Cowper admirably expresses the
general admiration in the lines:--

              Kites that swim sublime
  In still repeated circles, screaming loud.

The kites may be distinguished from other members of the tribe by their
forked tails. Somewhat of a scavenger, as we have already hinted, the kite
feeds also upon such small game as moles, frogs, young birds, rabbits,
snakes, and fish. Its partiality for young birds caused it to be much
dreaded in the farmyard in the days when it was common; and when, with the
introduction of modern and improved firearms, game-preserving became more
strenuously prosecuted, its doom was sealed, for a ceaseless war was waged
against it, which ended only with its extermination.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

SECRETARY-BIRD.

In full plumage the tail of this bird is much longer.]

Nearly allied to the Kites, the HONEY-BUZZARDS next claim attention. The
name Honey-buzzard is a misnomer, for honey forms no part of the bird's
food. This species exhibits, however, a quite remarkable partiality for the
immature stages of wasps and bees, the nests of which it tears in pieces
with its feet, so as to lay bare the coveted morsels, devouring them on the
spot, perfectly regardless of the stings of the infuriated insects, which
seem unable to penetrate its feathers. When its favourite food is not to be
had, it will feed upon corn, earth-worms, beetles, slugs, small birds'
eggs, and moles--a diet sufficiently strange for a bird of prey.
Honey-buzzards appear to be exemplary parents, for they are said to
construct a bower of leafy boughs above the nest to screen the young from
the sun, the boughs being replaced as they wither by fresh ones.

The honey-buzzard occurs but rarely in England, and nowhere appears to be a
very common bird, though it is said to be more frequently met with in
Arabia and Egypt than elsewhere. On migration, however, it appears in
unusually large numbers, the late Lord Lilford recording an occasion when
he observed many hundreds crossing the Straits of Gibraltar from Spain to
Africa. These were apparently on their autumnal migration to warmer winter
quarters.

The dash, energy, and courage which we are wont to associate with the Hawk
Tribe have certainly not been manifest in the members of the order which we
have examined so far; but these attributes will be evident enough in the
majority of the species with which we are now about to deal. One of the
most interesting of these fiercer forms is the OSPREY, or FISHING-HAWK. As
its name implies, it feeds largely upon fish, which it captures with great
dexterity, seizing them either with its feet from the surface of the water,
or by plunging entirely beneath the surface, when it disappears amid a
shower of spray, to emerge a moment later with a fish writhing in its
talons. To ensure a firm grip of its slippery prey, the soles of its feet
are armed with rough tubercles, whilst the foot is furthermore remarkable
in that the outer toe can be turned backwards, so as to lie parallel with
the hind toe--an arrangement rare in birds of the Hawk Tribe, but
characteristic of the Owls and some other birds. At times, it would seem,
the osprey seizes a fish too large to be raised from the water, when, owing
to the firm hold which the claws have taken, the bird is unable to release
itself, and is speedily dragged beneath the surface and drowned. Some have
suggested that the bird falls a victim, not to inability to free itself,
but rather to its obstinacy.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

EGYPTIAN KITE.

Feeding on garbage of all kinds, kites are useful birds in hot countries.]

The osprey is now rare in Great Britain, though it breeds occasionally in
the wilder parts of Scotland. It enjoys an extensive range, however, being
found all over the world. In America it appears to be very common. On an
island "off the eastern extremity of Long Island, New York," writes
Professor Newton, "300 nests were counted. The old birds were rearing their
young close together, living as peaceably as so many rooks, and were
equally harmless to other birds." Colonies of this kind are rare among
birds of prey.

Whilst the fiercer raptorial birds, which hunt and kill their prey, live
only upon small or medium-sized animals, a certain section, known as the
VULTURES, feed upon the carcases of the largest mammals which they find
either in the throes of death or already dead, and even far advanced in
decomposition. Gathering to the feast in large crowds, even the largest
bodies are soon demolished; and on this account the vultures are to be
reckoned amongst the most useful of birds, speedily removing matter which
in hot countries would rapidly endanger the health of neighbouring
communities.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S_]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN OSPREY.

This species of osprey is confined to Australia and the Austro-Malay
Islands.]

Many years ago a great controversy was waged over the question of the
faculty which guides the vulture in the discovery of its food, since it was
a matter of common knowledge that the traveller might sweep the horizon in
vain for a sign of these birds, yet, should a camel from a caravan fall out
and die, or men fall in warfare, within an incredibly short space of time a
crowd of vultures would be squabbling over the dead. Some held that the
vulture was guided by scent, others by sight, and this latter view is now
almost universally accepted. The bird's natural habit of soaring at an
immense height enables it to survey not only immense tracts of country, but
the actions of its neighbours soaring at the same altitude, though perhaps
miles away. So soon as one descries food it betrays the fact by its
actions, making off in the direction of the prospective feast; it is then
followed immediately by its yet more distant neighbour, and this by a
third, and so the first serves as a guide to all the other soaring birds
for miles around. This flight has been admirably expressed by Longfellow in
"Hiawatha."

We need here mention only one or two of the more important species of
vulture, and among these one of the most interesting is the LAMMERGEIR, or
BEARDED VULTURE. This species is one of the least vulture-like of the
tribe, not only in general appearance, but also in habits, and is to be
regarded as near the ancestral stock, whose descendants have become more
and more addicted to feeding upon dead bodies.

The lammergeir, or bearded vulture, is a bird of large size and majestic
flight, differing from all other vultures in that the head and neck are
clothed in feathers, whilst the nostrils are covered by long bristles.
Beneath the bill hangs a tuft of bristles like those covering the nostrils;
hence its name of Bearded Vulture; and this, coupled with a remarkable red
rim to the eyes, gives the bird an almost diabolical appearance. It lives
partly upon living animals and partly upon carrion, bones apparently being
especially relished; these it breaks by dropping them from a height upon
the rocks below, probably to get at the marrow. Land-tortoises are treated
in a similar manner, and it was possibly this species which caused the
death of the poet Æschylus, on whose bare head a tortoise is alleged to
have been dropped. It was at one time common in Europe, and is still fairly
numerous in West Africa, though rare in the East and South. Many stories
are told of its strength and daring, some of which concern the carrying off
of young children; but these are probably mythical, modern observers
generally agreeing that the bird is by nature far from courageous.

[Illustration: _Photo by Charles Knight_]     [_Aldershot._

BEARDED VULTURE.

It is called the Bearded Vulture on account of the tuft of bristles hanging
from the chin.]

The more typical vultures differ from the lammergeir in having the head and
neck more or less bare, and often conspicuously coloured, or covered with a
short velvety down. The CINEREOUS, GRIFFON, PONDICHERRY, and EGYPTIAN
VULTURES may be cited as examples of these.

The CINEREOUS or BLACK VULTURE is a heavy and repulsive-looking bird,
feeding entirely on garbage. On the wing, however, this vulture shares with
its relatives the admiration of all who have been privileged to watch it;
sailing in graceful circles in the blue sky of the tropics, or hurrying
from all quarters of the compass to some ghoulish feast, it forms a
spectacle, once seen, never to be forgotten. It is found on both sides of
the Mediterranean, and extends eastwards to India and China.

This species, like the GRIFFON-VULTURE, has the head and neck down-covered,
thus standing in strong contrast with the PONDICHERRY and SACRED VULTURES
of India and Africa, which have bare heads and necks ornamented by loose
folds or lappets of skin of a pinkish colour. These vultures hunt in pairs,
and are very self-assertive, driving away all other birds from their prey.
They build enormous nests of sticks in bushes and trees, thus differing
from the vultures previously described, which generally nest on ledges of
rock on precipitous cliffs. These nests are made of sticks, lined with
straw and leaves. A single egg is laid, which is white with red markings.
The largest species rivals the condor in size.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

GRIFFON-VULTURE.

This bird has once been taken in the British Islands.]

The EGYPTIAN VULTURE, sometimes known as PHARAOH'S HEN, is the smallest of
the vultures. The plumage is white; the head, throat, and fore part of the
neck are naked and of a lemon-yellow colour; whilst the feet are pink and
the eyes crimson. Not only is it a carrion-feeder, but it will also follow
the plough, picking up worms and grubs. This species occurs in Europe,
breeding in Provence and Savoy, the Madeiras, Cape Verde, the Canaries,
North and South Africa, and India. On three occasions it has wandered to
Great Britain.

We pass now to the EAGLES, a group the exact limits of which it is
impossible to define, since the forms so designated merge insensibly into
Buzzards, Hawks, Harriers, and so forth.

Eagles occur all over the world, save only in New Zealand. An eagle, it is
interesting to note, is the bird of Jove, the emblem of St. John and Rome,
and at the present day of the American Republic. It also plays an
emblematic part in Germany, Austria, and Russia.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

RÜPPELL'S VULTURE.

An African species, closely allied to the griffon.]

Of the true eagles, perhaps the best known is the GOLDEN EAGLE, or
MOUNTAIN-EAGLE--a British bird, breeding still, though in diminishing
numbers, in Scotland. In Ireland it is fast verging on extinction, trap,
gun, and poison having wrought its destruction. In times past it bred in
the Lake District of England. Abroad it is found over the greater part of
Europe, Northern Asia, India and China, and Northern Africa, and America as
far south as Mexico. It is a very fierce and powerful bird, attacking such
large animals as antelopes, wolves, and foxes, as well as the more helpless
fawns, lambs, hares and rabbits, and ducks, geese, grouse, and so on.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

ANGOLAN VULTURE.

A common West African bird, living upon fish and carrion.]

Very different from the free-roving golden eagle and its allies is the
South American HARPY-EAGLE. This is a denizen of the forest, of great size
and enormous strength, as the powerful bill and feet testify. Whilst other
eagles are conspicuous for their powers of flight, the present species is
rarely seen on the wing, being strictly a forest-dweller, with short wings
and tail, and of a somewhat owl-like plumage, the feathers being very soft.
At rest it is one of the most striking of all the eagles. The head is
crested, the under parts of the body are white, and the upper dark grey,
banded with black. It feeds upon sloths, peccaries, and spider-monkeys.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

PONDICHERRY VULTURE.

This Indian species is remarkable for the loose flaps of skin which hang
down on each side of the head.]

So recently as 1897 another forest-dwelling species was discovered in the
Philippines, and this also preys largely upon monkeys. Its nearest ally is
apparently the harpy-eagle, and, like this species, it is a bird of large
size and very powerful. It is further remarkable for the enormous size of
the beak, which differs from that of all other members of this group in
being much compressed from side to side.

The sea, as well as the mountain and the forest, is also, as it were,
presided over by members of this group, which are in consequence called
SEA-EAGLES. One species, the WHITE-TAILED EAGLE, or ERNE, is reckoned among
British birds, though it is fast verging on extinction. In former days it
bred on the sea-cliffs of Scotland and Ireland, and in the Lake District.
The nest, or eyrie, as it is called, is commonly placed on inaccessible
cliffs, but sometimes on the ground or in a tree, and, as is usual with the
group, is made of sticks, with a lining of finer materials. This eagle
feeds principally upon fish, though hares, lambs, and rabbits and carrion
are occasionally taken.

The Hawk Tribe, generally speaking, have the wings comparatively short, the
legs long and slender, and the edges of the beak with a sinuous outline and
unnotched; but it is impossible to sharply define the group. The best-known
species are the SPARROW- and GOS-HAWKS. The first named is still a common
British bird, but the latter has now become very rare indeed. In both
species the male is a much smaller bird than the female, and is also more
brightly coloured. The GOS-HAWK was at one time used in falconry; it is a
bird of extremely ferocious disposition, and in the days when hawks were
used for sporting purposes had to be kept very safely tethered, as, if it
gained its liberty, it would at once proceed to kill every other hawk and
falcon in the "mews."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

EGYPTIAN VULTURE.

This is one of the foulest feeders of the Vulture Tribe.]

The Falcon Tribe is divisible into two sections--the one containing the
American CARRION-HAWKS, and the other the FALCONS.

The CARRION-HAWKS, or CARACARAS, are long-legged birds which spend most of
their time on the ground and run well. They are said to hunt, not seldom in
packs, after the fashion of wild dogs. One species at least affords an
admirable example of mimicry--so rare among birds. This is the
CURASSOW-HAWK, so called from its resemblance to the curassow, one of the
Game-birds. The resemblance is evidently advantageous, for thereby the hawk
is enabled to sit quietly at rest till its prey comes within easy reach,
mistaking the hawk for the inoffensive curassow.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

WEDGE-TAILED EAGLE.

This is an Australian species, feeding chiefly upon carrion.]

The FALCONS form an exceedingly interesting group, if only on account of
the part which they played in the sports of mediæval England. Birds of
large size and forms as small as sparrows are included within the group;
all are very powerful on the wing, and all feed on living prey, though, in
the case of the diminutive forms, this may consist mainly, if not entirely,
of insects. The members of the Falcon Tribe may be distinguished from the
majority of the larger hawks by the fact that the eyes are dark hazel-brown
instead of yellow, and that the bare, yellow, waxy-looking band of skin at
the base of the beak, so characteristic of the Birds of Prey, is not
sharply defined, but scantily clothed with fine bristles, passing
insensibly into the feathers of the crown of the head.

Some of the best-known members of this section of the group are the
PEREGRINE and JER-FALCONS, and the KESTREL, HOBBY, and MERLIN. Only the
peregrine and the kestrel, however, can now be called common.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, Washington._

AMERICAN SPARROW-HAWK.

One of the smallest and handsomest of the American hawks.]

The PEREGRINE is the falcon held so much in esteem by falconers, by whom
the female only was called the "falcon," the male, which is smaller, being
known as a "tiercel." The female was used for the capture of the larger
game, such as herons and rooks; whilst the male was flown only at
partridges, and sometimes magpies.

In a wild state the peregrine falcon is regarded by other birds with the
greatest fear and terror. Ducks feeding on the banks of streams or lakes,
on perceiving it, immediately take to the water; whilst plovers and
lapwings rise to an immense height in the air, and remain there for hours.
Mr. Ussher, who has had many opportunities of studying this bird in
Ireland, where it is quite common, relates an instance of the tenacity with
which it follows its prey, in this case a lapwing. "The falcon," he says,
"after several stoops, cleverly avoided by the lapwing, was so near
clutching, that the poor bird, quite worn out, dropped into the water, and
the falcon, after rising from her stoop, poised a moment on her wings, and
then quietly lowering herself with extended legs, lifted the lapwing from
the water and bore her off."

The eyrie is generally found half-way up some precipitous cliff: no nest is
made, but the eggs are laid on the earth or gravel covering the selected
ledge. When eggs are found in a nest, the latter has always been taken from
some other bird, even the eagle being occasionally dispossessed. Three or
four eggs are laid, which are very beautiful and variable in their
coloration. The young are attended by their parents long after they are
able to fly.

The JER-FALCONS are birds of large size and great beauty, and at one time
were much in request by falconers, probably largely on account of their
appearance, for they lack the power and spirit of the peregrine. Grey and
black and white and black are distinctive colours of the various species,
which are inhabitants of northern regions.

The KESTREL, or WIND-HOVER, is one of the commonest birds of prey, much and
most unjustly persecuted by gamekeepers. In its general appearance it
closely resembles its much smaller relative, the so-called "SPARROW-HAWK"
of America, shown in the photograph on this page by Dr. Shufeldt. The
American sparrow-hawk, it should be mentioned, is really a species of
kestrel, and, like the British kestrel, belongs to the Falcon group of the
Birds of Prey. Like the peregrine falcon, the kestrel does not build a
nest, but takes possession of the deserted nests of crows and magpies, or
deposits its eggs on the bare earth of a recess in some cliff or quarry
which is overhung by a projecting shelf of rock. Occasionally a hole in a
tree is chosen, the eggs then resting on the rotten wood at the bottom.
That the kestrel is of a more confiding disposition than the majority of
its tribe seems to be proved by the fact that it will often deposit its
eggs in nesting-boxes, if these are placed in suitable spots. On some
English estates the harmlessness of this bird is fully recognised, and
every encouragement is given it to breed by the erection of these
nesting-boxes. By way of illustration we may cite a case where, on an
estate in Kent in 1900, five of these boxes were erected 20 or 30 feet from
the ground round a single field, all of which were tenanted by kestrels;
and though a thousand young pheasants were reared in this field, not a
single one of these was missed by the keepers. Besides its human enemies,
the kestrel has to contend with crows and rooks, which spare no efforts to
seize its eggs whenever the opportunity presents itself. The eggs, it
should be mentioned, are of a bright ruddy colour, but, like those of the
peregrine falcon, lose much of their freshness of colouring during
incubation. Four or five in number, they are laid at intervals of two days
or so, incubation commencing with the deposition of the first egg; as a
result, the first nestling hatched may be more than a week older than the
last.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

ROUGH-LEGGED BUZZARD.

Frequent in the British Islands.]

The food of the kestrel appears to consist mainly of mice, but frogs,
earthworms, grasshoppers, cockchafers, and other beetles are also taken.
Kestrels will also eat dead animals, as is proved by the fact that they are
not seldom found dead from eating poisoned rats laid out for magpies. One
instance is on record where a kestrel was taken with its claws entangled in
the fur of a stoat, which fiercely defended itself. It is an easy matter,
for those who will take the trouble, to find out what is the staple diet of
the kestrel; for if the nest and its neighbourhood be searched, numerous
small rounded pellets of the size of a chestnut will be found, which, when
broken up, will prove to be composed of the hard and indigestible parts of
what has been swallowed. The majority of such pellets are made up of the
fur and bones of mice.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

MARTIAL HAWK-EAGLE.

The Hawk-eagles show a marked preference for woody districts.]

The little AMERICAN "SPARROW-HAWK," which, as we have already pointed out,
is really a species of kestrel, appears to be almost exclusively
insectivorous during the summer months, preying mainly upon grasshoppers.
An American ornithologist, Mr. Henshaw, writing on the subject, remarks
that during a scourge of grasshoppers the sparrow-hawks assembled in
hundreds; and although on this occasion, owing to the vast myriads in which
these insects had collected, the birds could make no visible impression,
yet they must have done an immense amount of good. Ornithologists from all
parts of the United States unanimously agree that grasshoppers form the
staple diet of this hawk, though mice and gophers are also largely eaten,
and especially during the winter months, when insect food is scarce.

PEREGRINE FALCON.

A favourite in falconry.]

Of the PYGMY FALCONS there are several species, ranging from the Eastern
Himalaya, through Tenasserim and Burma, to the Malay Islands and the
Philippines. The smallest is the RED-LEGGED FALCONET of Nepal, Sikhim, and
Burma. It feeds largely upon insects, such as dragon-flies, beetles, and
butterflies, hawking them with a swallow-like speed. Occasionally the
members of this little group are said to hunt down and kill birds larger
than themselves.


OWLS.

Few birds have been more misrepresented in literature than the Owls. For
centuries they have been depicted as birds of ill omen, and accused of all
kinds of diabolical practices. Shakespeare, for example, repeatedly makes
the owl do duty for some evil sign, or fulfil some dire purpose. Thus in
_Macbeth_, Act II., Scene ii.,

  It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
  Which gives the stern'st good-night.

And later on, in Act IV., it is an owl's wing which he makes the witches
add to their caldron of noisome things, when brewing their deadly potion.
In Spain the scops and tawny owls are believed to be devil's birds, and are
accused of drinking the oil from the lamps suspended before the shrines of
saints. The gamekeeper nails their bodies up on the barn door as offenders
of the worst type, whilst the Malagasy believe owls to be the embodiments
of evil spirits.

SPECTACLED OWL.

A South American bird with a somewhat remarkable coloration.]

It is therefore a relief to find this unwarrantable prejudice is not
absolutely universal, since amongst some people, at least, the owl has
found some favour. The best-known instance of this is the case of the
Greeks, who made the owl the symbol of wisdom, and chose as an emblem,
singularly enough, the species known as the Little Owl, a bird which is
notorious for its ludicrous behaviour, so much so that it has earned for
itself the reputation of being the veritable buffoon of birds. Its
grotesque and ridiculous antics are utilised by Continental bird-catchers,
who use it as a lure to attract small birds, tethering it for this purpose
near nets, snares, or twigs smeared with bird-lime.

EAGLE-OWL.

An occasional visitor to the British Isles.]

Amongst other birds, strangely enough, the owl appears to be as much
disliked as the fiercer and more dangerous members of the Hawk Tribe, and
in consequence, should one venture abroad during the day or be discovered
in its retreat, the alarm is given, and every small bird within call is
summoned to take part in a general mobbing.

Although proverbially unpalatable, the Little Owl is said to be eaten in
Italy, as are other species in the various countries in which they are
found.

Varying considerably in size, the owls, nevertheless, present a very
general uniformity in appearance. All are remarkable for the peculiar
softness of their plumage, which imparts to the wings the almost unique
power of absolutely silent flight, the sound being deadened or muffled, so
that the prey can be approached suddenly, and seized before escape is
possible. This is very necessary when hunting in twilight hours. The owls
are almost the only birds in which the outer toe is reversible, or capable
of being turned either forwards or backwards. Furthermore, the members of
this group are remarkable for the fact that the eyes look directly forward,
instead of outwards, as in other birds, and that the feathers of the face
are arranged round each eye in the form of a disk, and thus impart the
familiar owl-like visage, seen elsewhere only among certain of the Hawk
Tribe known as "Harriers."

VIRGINIAN EAGLE-OWL.

A common North American species, feeding largely on small mammals.]

Four species of owl are to be found sparsely distributed over Great
Britain. We may regard as the typical owl the species known as the TAWNY or
WOOD-OWL. It is the largest of the resident owls in England, and would be
much more abundant but that it is subjected to a rigorous and foolish
persecution, born of long-standing prejudice and ignorance; it stands
accused of the heinous offence of eating game, a charge which has never yet
been fully proved. The benefits it confers are great, but, unfortunately,
unrecognised, for its chief food consists of rats and mice. This is the
bird which gives utterance to that weird "hoo-hoo--hoo-hoo-hoo," one of the
most charming of the many delightful sounds that break the stillness of the
summer nights. It is interesting to note that this species is unknown as a
wild bird in Ireland.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

AMERICAN LONG-EARED OWL.

This is a young bird which has not yet completely lost its down-feathers.]

Other and fairly common species in England are the LONG- and SHORT-EARED
OWLS, both remarkable for the fact that the aperture of the ear, which is
of enormous size, is of a different shape on the right and left sides of
the head. These owls, furthermore, are characterised by the possession of a
pair of feathery tufts, or "horns," springing from the top of the head,
which can be erected or depressed at pleasure. These horns are found in
many species of owl not necessarily closely related. The species under
consideration are of medium size, with large eyes of a most wonderful
golden-yellow colour, standing in strong contrast with those of the tawny
owl, which are nearly black. Like the tawny owl, these two species, and
especially the short-eared, live largely on rats and mice. The last-named
bird also devours great numbers of dor-beetles and cockchafers.

Amongst the largest of the tribe are the EAGLE- and SNOWY OWLS, both of
which are occasionally met with in Great Britain. The eagle-owl may be
described as a largely magnified long-eared owl in general appearance,
though, as a matter of fact, the two are not very closely related. The
snowy owl, as its name implies, is white in colour, the white being
relieved by more or less conspicuous black markings. This white livery,
assimilating with its snowy surroundings, allows the wearer to approach its
prey unperceived on the snow. Whilst the snowy owl is confined to northern
regions, the eagle-owl enjoys a wide distribution, and is represented by
numerous species, one of which, as we have remarked, occasionally visits
Great Britain. The larger species of eagle-owl are the most ferocious
members of the order, and prey largely upon hares, rabbits, and the large
game-birds; whilst the snowy owl, though selecting similar prey, does
incalculable good by devouring those destructive little rodents known as
the lemmings.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

TAWNY OWL.

One of the commonest British owls.]

Solitary as owls usually are, some, as the AMERICAN BURROWING-OWLS, live in
what may be called colonies; and, stranger still, they live in burrows,
which they share with the original excavators. Occurring both in North and
South America, it is not surprising to find that the creatures with whom
the burrowing-owls elect to take up their abode are very varied, belonging
for the most part to numerous groups of burrowing mammalia. In the prairies
of North America they appear to quarter themselves upon the prairie-dogs,
ground-squirrels, and badgers; and in the pampas of South America upon the
Patagonian cavy, the viscacha and armadillos, and occasionally lizards. It
seems to be no unusual thing to find, in addition to the bird and mammal
tenants of a single burrow, one or more full-grown examples of the
much-dreaded rattle-snake--a truly wonderful happy-family, if all accounts
are to be believed. But many competent to speak on the matter throw out
dark hints which would appear to show that the owl quarters itself on the
tenants of a burrow too weak to resist its intrusion upon their domicile,
and that occasionally this most masterful bird renders itself still more
objectionable by devouring the progeny of its hosts, and sometimes even the
hosts themselves.

The species known as PYGMY OWLS and LITTLE OWLS we mention here only on
account of their small size, one member of the former group being little
bigger than a lark. Thus they stand in strong contrast with the giant snowy
and eagle-owls.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

SCREECH-OWL.

A common North American bird, feeding on small animals of all kinds.]

Finally, we have the WHITE or BARN-OWL, which with its allies forms a group
distinguished from all the other owls by certain well-marked structural
characters. The barn-owl is also to be found in Great Britain, but is
growing, like all the other owls in this area, more and more rare every
year, owing to persecution at the hands of gamekeepers. It is a handsome
bird, of a pale buff-yellow, mottled with grey above to pure white beneath,
and with the characteristic facial disk peculiarly well developed. It
breeds in holes in trees, ruins, and church towers, and feeds almost
entirely on mice and rats. From the piercing note which it occasionally
utters, it is also known as the SCREECH-OWL.

CHAPTER X.

_NIGHT-JARS, SWIFTS, AND HUMMING-BIRDS._


NIGHT-JARS.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

COMMON NIGHT-JAR.

Known also as Fern-owl and Goat-sucker.]

It is probable that the NIGHT-JARS are the nearest allies of the Owls. As
pointed out in the last chapter, although the latter have acquired the
habits of the Hawk and Eagle Tribe, they are not really connected with that
group by descent.

Soberly clad, so as to be in complete harmony with its surroundings, with
large eyes, huge mouth, and peculiarly short beak, beset with long
bristles, the night-jar may be distinguished at once from all other British
birds. By day it hides, squatting close to the ground, or perched on the
thick branch of a tree; but when on the latter, it sits along and not
across the bough, like other birds, the complete harmony between its
plumage and the bark rendering it as invisible as when on the ground.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

PENNANT-WINGED NIGHT-JAR (FRONT VIEW).

The long and graceful plumes are much-lengthened quill-feathers, and by
their resemblance to the waving grass in which the bird nests afford
protection.]

Not until the spring has far advanced does this bird leave its winter
resort in Africa for Europe, making its presence known by its conspicuous
habit of hunting its food (which consists of moths and beetles) after
twilight has fallen. Later, its extraordinary churring note is heard--a
note which has been likened to the noise made by a spinning-wheel, and so
powerful as to be audible half a mile off. This note is made while on the
ground: on the wing, while toying with its mate, another equally peculiar
sound is made, which has been likened to the noise made by swinging a
whip-thong through the air.

No nest is made by this bird; but the eggs, two in number and beautifully
marked, are laid on the bare ground. The young are covered with down, and
remain in the nest for some time.

Another very remarkable feature is the fact that the claw of the middle toe
has its inner edge curiously serrated, forming a sort of comb, the function
of which is unknown. This comb-like claw occurs also in some few other
birds--bitterns, for instance.

A very remarkable kind is the PENNANT-WINGED NIGHT-JAR, in which one of the
quill-feathers in each wing is produced into a "pennant" of some 17 inches
in length. The shaft of the feather is bare for the greater part of its
length, and terminates in a feathery blade. It is an Abyssinian species
about which not much is known.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

MORE-PORKS.

So called from the note they utter.]

Some of the night-jars, as the New World NIGHT-HAWK and the Old World EARED
NIGHT-JARS, are particularly owl-like, a resemblance imparted by long
"ear-like" tufts of feathers which rise from the back of the head. Others,
as the MORE-PORK of the Tasmanian colonist, or the FROG-MOUTH, as it is
called in Australia, are remarkable for the huge size of the mouth,
bounded, as it appears to be, by huge lips, represented by the short,
round-edged beak.

Very nearly related to the night-jars is the OIL-BIRD of South America,
which lives in caves in Trinidad, Ecuador, and Peru, where it builds a nest
which has been likened in appearance to a huge cheese, and in which are
laid from two to four white eggs. Like the night-jars, these birds feed by
night, emerging from their gloomy retreats at twilight with much noise and
in great numbers. Their food, however, is entirely of a vegetable nature,
consisting of oily nuts or fruits.

The young, soon after they are hatched, become perfect masses of fat, and
on this account are much in demand by the Indians, who make a special
business of killing them and extracting the oil.


SWIFTS.

In general appearance SWIFTS bear a strong superficial resemblance to
Swallows; in reality they are related, not to those harbingers of spring,
but to the Night-jars on the one hand and the Humming-birds on the other.

The COMMON SWIFT arrives in England during the early part of May, and stays
till the end of August, or sometimes till September has half run its
course. Black in colour, relieved only by a white throat, it has little in
the sense of beauty to recommend it; nevertheless, there are probably few
who do not cherish tender feelings towards this bird. The swift has great
buoyancy of spirits, as is manifested by the wild, exuberant bursts of
screaming to which it gives voice as it rushes in small parties down the
lanes or along the less-frequented thoroughfares of towns as morning breaks
or evening falls, and occasionally throughout the day. The greater part of
its life is spent upon the wing (indeed, it appears to rest only when
incubating or sleeping), and of all the smaller birds it is the most
graceful in flight, turning and twisting in fairy mazes high in the heavens
for hours at a time.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

MORE-PORK.

This is one of the most owl-like of the Night-jars.]

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

SWIFT.

A common British bird during the summer months.]

The swift chooses for its nesting-place the eaves of houses and holes in
church towers, and occasionally a crevice in the face of a quarry. The nest
is formed of bits of straw, dry grass, and a few feathers, glued together
by a secretion of the salivary glands into a compact crust; in this the
bird deposits from two to four white eggs. The young, which are hatched
naked and blind, never develop down-feathers, but soon become more or less
imperfectly clothed in a mass of tiny spines, representing the budding
feathers; these give the bird somewhat the appearance of a young hedgehog.

In adaptation to its remarkable powers of flight, the wing has undergone
considerable modification in form, so that it differs from that of all
other birds. On the other hand, the legs, being so little required, have
diminished considerably, and are remarkable for their smallness--a fact
which hampers the bird considerably, should it happen to alight on level
ground, for, owing to the great length of the wings, it can arise only with
considerable difficulty.

Nearly allied to the common swift is SALVIN'S SWIFT, remarkable on account
of its nest, which has been described by Dr. Sharpe as the most wonderful
in the world. About 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, it looks rather
like the sleeve of an old coat than a nest. It is made entirely of the
downy seeds of plants, which, floating through the air after the fashion of
such seeds, are caught by the birds when on the wing, and, partly felted
and partly glued by the salivary secretion, are woven slowly into the
characteristic woolly domicile. The site and manner of fixation of the nest
are scarcely less wonderful, for it is suspended from the flat surface of
some projecting piece of rock on the face of a cliff, and is thus almost
inaccessible; yet, as if to make assurance doubly sure, two entrances are
made, one at the bottom, which is really blind, and one at the top, near
its foundation, if we may call it so, which leads into the nursery.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

EDIBLE SWIFT.

The nests of this bird are used for soup; five are seen in this
photograph.]

Still more swallow-like in general appearance are the diminutive EDIBLE
SWIFTS, so called, not on account of the palatability of the birds
themselves, but of their nests, which are in great demand by the wealthy
Chinese for conversion into birds'-nest soup. It has already been remarked
that the salivary glands are unusually active in the swifts, their
secretion bearing a very important part in the construction of the nest,
and serving as a kind of cement. It is, therefore, not surprising that in
some members of the group we find this secretion playing a still more
prominent part, forming, at least in one species, the entire material of
the nest. "With these nests," writes Dr. Sharpe, "a large trade is done
with China from many of the Malayan Islands, over 3,500,000 nests having
been known to be exported in a single year from Borneo to the latter
country.... In Borneo and other places the caves in which the swiftlets
build are leased to the collectors for a considerable sum; but it is only
the white nests, made of the pure secretion, which are of any real value.
The nests of those species which mix into their nests grass or feathers are
not appreciated as an article of commerce."

Colonel Legge gives some extremely interesting particulars concerning the
nesting habits of these birds in Ceylon. "It is noteworthy," he writes,
"that the partially fledged young--which were procured on this occasion for
me, and which I kept for the night--scrambled out on to the exterior of the
nest, and slept in an upright position, with the bill pointing straight up.
This is evidently the normal mode of roosting resorted to by this species.
The interior of this cave, with its numbers of active tenants, presented a
singular appearance. The bottom was filled with a vast deposit of liquid
guano, reaching, I was informed, to a depth of 30 feet, and composed of
droppings, old nests, and dead young fallen from above, the whole mingled
into a loathsome mass, with water lodged in the crevices, and causing an
awful stench, which would have been intolerable for a moment even, had not
the hundreds of frightened little birds, as they screamed and whirred in
and out of the gloomy cave with a hum like a storm in a ship's rigging,
powerfully excited my interest, and produced a long examination of the
colony. This guano-deposit is a source of considerable profit to the
estate, the hospitable manager of which informed us that he had manured 100
acres of coffee with it during that season."


HUMMING-BIRDS.

It is generally admitted that HUMMING-BIRDS are nearly related to Swifts,
with which, however, they stand in the strongest possible contrast in the
matter of plumage--the latter being always inconspicuously coloured, whilst
the former are for the most part clad in vestments so gorgeous as to render
it extremely difficult to describe them in sober language. Moreover, so
great is the wealth of species--some hundreds in number--and so varied are
the form and coloration, and so closely do the various types pass one into
the other, that their classification is a matter of extreme difficulty.

Confined to the American Continent and certain islands adjacent thereto,
humming-birds range from Canada to Tierra del Fuego in a horizontal
direction, and rise vertically in the mountain-range of Chimborazo to a
height of 16,000 feet above the sea-level--"dwelling," as Professor Newton
describes it, "in a world of almost constant hail, sleet, and rain, and
feeding on the insects which resort to the indigenous flowering plants."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

RUBY-THROATED HUMMING-BIRDS.

About 500 distinct species of humming-birds are known.]

Humming-birds surpass all others in the wondrous beauty of their plumage,
which depends not so much on colour as metallic lustre reflecting all the
hues of the most precious stones--amethyst, ruby, sapphire, emerald, and
topaz gleaming and sparkling from their bodies with a fire and intensity
truly marvellous. "In some cases," as Professor Newton aptly describes it,
"this radiance beams from the brow, in some it glows from the throat, in
others it shines from the tail-coverts, in others it sparkles from the tips
of elongated feathers that crest the head or surround the neck as with a
frill, while again in others it may appear as a luminous streak across the
cheek.... The feathers that cover the upper parts of the body very
frequently have a metallic lustre of golden green, which in other birds
would be thought sufficiently beautiful, but in the [humming-birds] its
sheen is overspread by the almost dazzling splendour that radiates from the
spots where Nature's lapidary has set her jewels."

Besides this brilliancy of colour and variety in form--variety due to the
development of these crests and frills, or to the forking and elongation of
the tail-feathers--still further changes are brought about by the
modification of the bill, which may be produced into a long straight style,
longer than the body of the bird, or turned up like that of the avocet or
down like that of the curlew. These changes are adaptations to the bird's
methods of feeding, some seeking their food from the long tubular corollas
of flowers, and requiring, therefore, very elongated beaks, others from
more open and easily accessible flowers, whilst others hunt among leaves,
especially the under-surfaces, the quarry consisting mainly of insects
attracted by the honey secreted by the flowers, or those living on the
leaves. Not only the beak but the tongue also has undergone great
modification in this group, its outer sheath curling up on each side into a
thin scroll, so as to form a pair of tubes, the exact use of which is
unknown. The wings, like those of the swift, have undergone a certain
amount of change in the relative proportion of the several regions, and in
the form and number of the quill-feathers, whilst the legs have become
considerably reduced in size. In some species each leg is surrounded by a
little tuft of down, which may be black, brown, or snow-white in colour. In
size these birds vary from 8 inches to scarcely more than 3 inches.

"The beautiful nests of humming-birds," writes Professor Newton, "than
which the fairies could not have conceived more delicate ... will be found
on examination to be very solidly and tenaciously built, though the
materials are generally of the slightest--cotton-wool, or some vegetable
down, and spiders' webs. They vary greatly in form and ornamentation--for
it would seem that the portions of lichen which frequently bestud them are
affixed to their exterior with that object, though probably concealment was
the original intention. They are mostly cup-shaped; and the singular fact
is on record, that in one instance, as the young grew, the walls were
heightened by the parents, until at last the nest was more than twice as
big as when the eggs were laid and hatched."

CHAPTER XI.

_PARROTS, CUCKOOS, AND PLANTAIN-EATERS._


PARROTS.

"The art of taming wild animals," writes Mr. Jenks in his "History of
Politics," "and making them serve the purposes of man, is one of the
greatest discoveries of the world." He holds--and there can be little
question as to its reasonableness--"that the domestication of animals
converted the savage pack into the patriarchal tribe," and that the
earliest domesticated animals were pets. How great a share, then, PARROTS
may have had in this civilisation and advancement no man can tell, for it
is impossible to say how long these beautiful birds may have been esteemed
as pets, or how early they were introduced to the notice of the civilised
peoples of past generations. Certain it is, however, that for more than
2,000 years they have been held in the highest esteem.

Modern discovery has added enormously to the list of known parrots, so that
to-day more than 500 different species have been described, and these may
be divided into NESTORS, LORIES, COCKATOOS, COCKATEELS, MACAWS, and
KAKAPOS.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

KEA

Also known as the Mountain-nestor.]

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

NEW ZEALAND KEA.

The kea frequents the slopes of lofty snow-covered mountains.]

Of the first named, the best known is the KEA, or MOUNTAIN-NESTOR, of the
South Island, New Zealand. Dull in coloration, and not striking in
appearance, it has earned an unenviable notoriety, which appears to rest as
much upon fable as upon fact. It seems that, since the introduction of
sheep into this part of the world by the settlers, this bird has found a
diet of flesh more stimulating than one of fruit. Exactly how this came to
be is not known. Two explanations have been advanced. The first has it that
the birds settled on the skins of the sheep slaughtered for their wool, and
picked off pieces of fat therefrom, as well as various tit-bits from the
carcases of the same, and thus found out how toothsome--or beaksome--mutton
was. From this they went a step further, and did the slaughtering for
themselves. Parties of them now go a-hunting, worry a sheep till exhausted,
then dig down through the back, and so wound the intestines that death
results. Another explanation is that the birds in the original instance
mistook the sheep's backs for the huge masses of lichen common to this
region, of which the birds are very fond. Not finding it to their taste at
the top, they dug deep, and soon came to the flesh, which, like the
forbidden fruit, proved more palatable than that which was provided for
them by a bountiful Nature. The result is, that they have become a menace
to sheep-farmers, and are on this account in danger of extermination. It
has, however, been denied recently that the damage inflicted is anything
like so serious as was at one time reported, since on one run, where the
damage was unusually large, only 1 in 300 sheep was so attacked. This bird
has also been said to attack horses.

Very different, in general appearance and in esteem, are the LORIES. Like
the Nestors, the tip of the upper jaw, or beak, is smooth, or nearly so;
and in this respect these two groups are to be distinguished from all the
other parrots; but in the gorgeousness of their plumage they far eclipse
their congeners. Absent in New Zealand, they are found elsewhere throughout
the Australasian region, inclusive of Polynesia, and are highly esteemed as
pets, combining great beauty with a very docile disposition and
considerable talking powers.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

NEW ZEALAND KAKA.

The Maoris keep this bird as a lure.]

The birds of this section are also known as BRUSH-TONGUED PARROTS, from the
presence of a remarkable "brush" borne on the end of the tongue. This is a
special adaptation, enabling the birds to feed upon honey; some, indeed,
have this brush particularly well developed, and are almost entirely
honey-seekers, whilst others, wherein the brush is less developed, live
largely on fruits. Professor Moseley tells us that honey literally poured
from the mouths of BLUE MOUNTAIN-LORIES which he shot at Cape York.

The COCKATOOS are abundant in the Australian region, but have their
headquarters in the Malay Archipelago. Besides the familiar white-crested
form so commonly kept in England, the group includes an iron-grey coloured
bird with a bright red head, and a huge black species, which represents the
giant of the order. It is a funereal-looking bird, the largest specimens
inhabiting New Guinea. One of its most striking features is the beak, which
is of enormous size. Its tongue differs from that of other parrots in that
it is slender and cylindrical in shape, and of a deep red colour, instead
of thick, fleshy, and black. It frequents, Mr. Wallace tells us, the lower
parts of the forest, feeding upon various fruits and seeds, but displaying
a marked partiality for the kernel of the canary-nut, which grows on a
lofty forest-tree; "and the manner in which it gets at these seeds," writes
Mr. Wallace, "shows a correlation of structure and habits which would point
to the canary as its special food. The shell of this nut is so excessively
hard that only a heavy hammer will crack it; it is somewhat triangular, and
the outside is quite smooth. The manner in which the bird opens these nuts
is very curious. Taking one end-ways in its bill, and keeping it firm by a
pressure of the tongue, it cuts a transverse notch by a lateral sawing
motion of the sharp-edged lower mandible. This done, it takes hold of the
nut with its foot, and, biting off a piece of leaf, retains it in the deep
notch by the upper mandible, and again seizing the nut, which is prevented
from slipping by the elastic tissue of the leaf, fixes the edge of the
lower mandible in the notch, and a powerful rip breaks off a piece of the
shell. Again taking the nut in its claws, it inserts the very long and
sharp point of the bill, and picks out the kernel, which is seized hold of,
morsel by morsel, by the extensile tongue."

Of the typical parrots, the best known is the common GREY AFRICAN PARROT,
with a red tail, so valued on account of its great talking powers. Other
species of this section which should be mentioned here are the PYGMY
PARROTS, MACAWS, HAWK-BILLED PARROT, BUDGERIGARS, and OWL-PARROT.

The first named are the smallest of all the tribe, remarkable as well for
the splendour of the plumage as their size, which is less than that of the
common sparrow.

The LONG-TAILED MACAWS, representing the most showy and gaudily coloured of
all the Parrot Tribe, inhabit the tropical forests of South America. Mr.
Bates describes a flock of scarlet-and-blue macaws, which he came across
one day, as looking like a cluster of flaunting banners among the crown of
dark green leaves of a bacaba-palm.

The superb HYACINTHINE MACAW is one of the rarest of the Parrot Tribe, and
was found by Bates in the interior of Brazil. As its name implies, it is of
a deep hyacinthine colour, relieved by a bare patch of pure white skin
round the eyes. It feeds on the nuts of several palms, especially those of
the macuja. These nuts, which are so hard as to be difficult to break

macaw.

BLACK COCKATOO.

Crests among parrots are common enough, but only one species wears a frill;
this is the HAWK-BILLED PARROT of the Amazon Valley. It is closely related
to the large and well-known AMAZON PARROTS, and has been aptly described as
a most extraordinary bird. Its coloration is striking--green above, with a
brown head; the frill or ruff around the neck shows up in strong contrast,
being dark red, with blue edges, and barred with blue. The feathers of the
breast and abdomen, like the frill, are also red and blue, whilst the
under-surfaces of the tail and wings are black. It is only when the bird is
excited or angry that the ruff is raised.

COCKATOO.

Cockatoos in a wild state often congregate in immense flocks.]

The HANGING-PARROTS are about the same size as the well-known "love-birds,"
and remarkable for their habit of sleeping suspended head-downwards by one
foot from the boughs of trees. They are all brilliantly coloured birds, and
have a fairly wide range, extending from India and the Philippines through
the Malay region as far east as Duke of York Island.

The Australian BUDGERIGARS, or GRASS-PARRAKEETS, need no description here;
but it is interesting to note that nearly allied to them is a small species
known as the SWAMP- or LONG-TAILED GROUND-PARRAKEET. As its name implies,
it is a ground-dwelling species, and, in accordance with this habit, has
considerably longer legs than the tree-haunting species. This lengthening
of the leg in arboreal species is seen also among pigeons and many other
birds.

LEADBEATER'S COCKATOO.

The most interesting, perhaps, of all the parrots is the remarkable KAKAPO,
or OWL-PARROT, of New Zealand. Like the species just described, it is also
a ground-dweller; furthermore, it differs from all other members of the
tribe in being flightless, and, like the flightless members of the Ostrich
Tribe, has completely lost the deep keel from the breast-bone, which gives
support to the muscles which move the wings. It is a large bird, green in
colour, mottled with yellow and black, and derives its name of Owl-parrot
from the fact that the feathers of the face radiate from the eye outwards
to form a kind of disk. When eating grass, it is said to graze, nibbling
after the fashion of a rabbit. Occasionally it is said to climb trees,
descending with extended wings, so as to break the force of its career. It
has been described as a playful and affectionate pet in captivity,
displaying also great cleverness and intelligence. Unfortunately it is
growing more and more rare, so that its final extermination is only a
question of time--the ravages of dogs, cats, and pigs, introduced by the
settlers, being mainly the agents of destruction.

Once common all over New Zealand, the range of the owl-parrot is now
restricted to the mountainous regions of North Island and the northern half
of South Island. During the day it remains concealed in the holes in rocks
or under roots of trees, and if disturbed is difficult to rouse. When taken
from its retreat, it runs swiftly, and tries to hide, seeking shelter, if
possible, under a heap of soft, dry grass. At sunset, however, it becomes
very animated, and travels--at least when possible--in companies, making
tracks a foot or more wide across the herbage. It feeds greedily upon
mosses, ferns, seeds, berries, and, it is said, even lizards, giving vent,
when devouring some favourite morsel, to a kind of grunting noise.

The kakapo nests in holes under trees and rocks, laying two or three eggs,
which, like those of the Parrots, are white.

The natives take advantage of its feeble powers of flight, hunting it on
foot by torchlight, aided by dogs, which, it is said, are not seldom
seriously wounded by the powerful bill.

When the breeding-season is over, these birds appear to live in small
communities, four or five occupying the same hole. They are apparently
gifted with some foresight, inasmuch as they lay up a store of food, to be
drawn upon during bad weather.


CUCKOOS AND PLANTAIN-EATERS.

The Cuckoo Tribe is somewhat unfortunate in that the numerous members of
which it is composed are completely overshadowed by the prominence which
has been given to the COMMON CUCKOO. Few birds, indeed, have managed to
secure so much attention, the poet in particular having sung its praises
without stint. This enthusiasm undoubtedly is but an echo of the general
popular sentiment, for there are few birds to which we in Britain extend a
more hearty welcome, its well-known cry possessing a peculiar charm for
lovers of the country. Coming to us in April, and leaving again in July,
its stay is of the shortest; but during the greater part of this time its
whereabouts may generally be known by the familiar call "cuckoo, cuckoo,"
though undergoing certain characteristic changes as the months glide by.

Apart from its song, one of the most interesting things concerning the
cuckoo is the fact that it goes about in disguise--the disguise of the ass
in the lion's skin with a vengeance; for it is clothed in the garb of that
terror of the countryside, the sparrow-hawk. Nay, more; it has also most
successfully imitated the flight of that bogy; and this to frighten little
birds--not, however, for the mere purpose of creating consternation amongst
them, but for far more sinister ends.

Somehow or another, in cuckoo society, the rearing of a family is a
responsibility which is utterly repudiated. Great pains seem to have been
taken to evade this duty, and yet to ensure the continuity of their
distinguished house. The oviparous method of reproduction, which obtains in
the feathered world, has been turned to good account--in fact, everything
depends upon this. It seems to have suggested itself as far more convenient
to drop an egg here and there into a neighbour's nursery, and leave the
work of bringing it to life to the owners thereof. But to carry out this
system of distributing foundlings requires tact, cunning, and the mutual
co-operation of both the male and his--at least temporary--wife; hence the
disguise. The plan of execution very frequently adopted is for the male to
hover over the treasure-house of the intended foster-parents hawk-wise.
This is sure to call forth an attack from the poor little wretches
threatened, which ends in an apparently hasty retreat of the marauder,
followed by his fearless assailants. No sooner is the coast clear, however,
than the wily female, taking her egg in her beak, slips quietly up to the
nest and deposits her burden.

YOUNG CUCKOO EJECTING EGG.

The egg is held in position by the head and wings.]

Let us imagine that this home so lately threatened is that of the modest
little hedge-sparrow, and take a peep during the absence of the owners,
after quiet has established itself once again. Lying side by side with the
tiny sky-blue eggs of the hedge-sparrow we should find the relatively
large, greyish-green or reddish-grey egg of the cuckoo. What a contrast! If
the hedge-sparrows notice this too, they evidently do not mind, for they
invariably hatch it with their own.

But some birds are not so accommodating as this, and would ruthlessly
destroy or reject any egg surreptitiously introduced into the nest.
Consequently more deception has to be practised. The hawk-like garb still
serves its purpose to draw off the intended dupes from the nest; but this
is not enough, for to deposit an egg of the normal cuckoo type would be
worse than useless, since it would meet with instant destruction on the
return of the owners of the nest. But the cuckoo, strange to say, has
proved equal to the occasion, and meets the difficulty by laying an egg to
match those in the nest. The Redstart, Wagtail, Sedge-warbler, Red-backed
Shrike, and Meadow-pipit may be cited as instances of--shall we say
exclusive?--birds which must be circumvented by "colourable imitations."
Perhaps the most wonderful of the cuckoo successes in this direction is the
imitation of the redstart's egg, which is blue.

Naturally these facts have given rise to much speculation, but even now we
cannot regard the discussion as finally settled. Some ornithologists held
that the egg of every individual cuckoo was subject to great variations,
and that the place of deposit of each egg was determined only after the
bird had ascertained its colour. If this were true, surely we should find
blue cuckoos' eggs in hedge-sparrows' as well as redstarts' nests. But we
don't! Others have sought to explain the existence of mimicking eggs to the
influence of the food peculiar to the foster-parent upon the germ of the
young female cuckoo, which, through this channel, became transmitted to all
its descendants. To support this hypothesis it was necessary to throw
overboard the old individual variability explanation, and to adopt one that
is certainly nearer the truth--to wit, that each cuckoo chooses the nest of
that species in which itself was reared as a depository, in turn, for its
own egg, and only when such is not available will it select some other
species, and trust to luck for its adoption. This would certainly account
for many anomalies; but as it seems that there are more eggs unlike than
like those of the selected foster-parents, it cannot be a perfect
explanation.

A third explanation takes that part of the second for granted which assumes
that cuckoos select nests of the species which served them as
foster-parents, and explains the mimicry, when this occurs, as due to the
results of natural selection.

Our interest, however, in the domestic economy of the common cuckoo is not
to be allowed to drop with the incubation of the egg. The perfidy of the
parents seems to have cast a sombre shadow over the cradle of the
offspring, an evil spell destined to bear fruit with terrible suddenness;
for the young, before it is many hours old, and while yet blind and naked,
perpetrates its first act of wrong-doing by committing murder! There is no
case here of wilful or ignorant misrepresentation and slander, such as many
of our feathered friends are made to suffer at our hands--no foolish
prejudice such as has blasted the reputation of some of our most guiltless
and useful of bird-citizens. The witnesses of the crime of which we speak
are many and unimpeachable. The facts are as follows:--

[Illustration: _Photo by Billington_]     [_Queensland._

PHEASANT-CUCKOO.

The hind toe terminates in a spur-like claw; hence these cuckoos are known
as Lark-heeled Cuckoos.]

The parent cuckoo deposits her egg in the nest of some other bird with
those of the owners thereof. All are hatched. In a few hours after the
arrival of the young cuckoo the foster-brothers and -sisters invariably
disappear, and are not seldom found in the immediate neighbourhood of the
nest. That they must have been removed by force is certain; but this force
cannot be attributed to the natural parents. The evidence of the first
witnesses, therefore, was worthy of all consideration; and since their
accounts have been frequently confirmed by most trustworthy observers, we
must now admit the charge proved. One of the best known of these accounts
is that of Mrs. Hugh Blackburn. She has given us a vivid picture of this
most extraordinary of domestic tragedies. The victims in this instance were
meadow-pipits. Finding a pipit's nest with a cuckoo's egg therein, she kept
it carefully under observation. At one visit she found the pipits hatched,
but not the cuckoo. Forty-eight hours later the cuckoo had not only
arrived, but ousted his foster-brothers and -sisters, who were found lying
outside the nest, but yet alive. They were replaced beside the cuckoo,
which at once reopened hostilities for the purpose of maintaining its
absolute possession of the nursery. This it did by burrowing under one of
them, which, balanced upon its back, it proceeded to eject by climbing up
the nest tail-foremost, till, reaching the brim, it could relieve itself of
its burden by heaving it over the edge and down the bank. Pausing a moment,
it then felt backwards with its wings to make sure the pipit was really
gone, and, having satisfied itself on this point, subsided to the bottom of
the nest. Next day, when the nest was visited, the remaining pipit was
found outside the nest cold and dead. "But what struck me most," she
writes, "was this: the cuckoo was perfectly naked, without a vestige of a
feather or even a hint of feathers, its eyes were not yet opened, and its
neck seemed too weak to support the weight of its head. The pipits had
well-developed quills on the wings and back, and had bright eyes partially
opened, yet they seemed quite helpless under the manipulations of the
cuckoo, which looked a much less developed creature."

CUCKOO ONE DAY OLD IN HEDGE-SPARROW'S NEST.

The young bird has its mouth open, ready for all the food the
foster-parents can collect.]

The GREAT SPOTTED CUCKOO of South Europe and North Africa is a species
which, though parasitic, does not seem to have sunk to such a depth as the
common cuckoo. Its eggs very closely resemble those of certain magpies and
crows within its breeding-area, and it is in the nests of these that they
are deposited. We may assume that mimicry has been resorted to, and become
perfected by the same means as have accomplished this end in the case of
the common cuckoo. We notice here, however, two points of difference
therefrom. In the first place, from two to four eggs are left in each nest
instead of one; and, secondly, the young cuckoos seem to live in perfect
amity with their foster-brothers and -sisters--there is no ejection of the
rightful heirs.

Having pledged themselves to a course of deception and treachery, there is
no telling the lengths to which such conduct may lead. We have already seen
that the bird has succeeded in laying what we may call forged eggs, but we
come now to an instance where the young has also to be disguised. This is
furnished by a species of cuckoo known as the KOEL, inhabiting Palawan, an
island in the Philippines. This bird shifts its parental duties upon the
shoulders of a species of myna inhabiting the same island. Now, the mynas
are black, and their young, as is often the case where both sexes are
coloured alike, resemble the parents, and are black likewise. With the
cuckoo the case is different. The male and female are conspicuously
different in coloration, the former being black, the latter brown. In such
cases it is the rule for the young to wear the livery of the female. If
this rule were adhered to in the case of the cuckoo, destruction would be
more than probable, for the mynas would as likely as not destroy so
outrageous a departure from myna custom as a brown youngster. But the koel
has proved equal to the occasion, by the simple expedient of attiring the
young in the male instead of the female livery. Later on in life the rule
for the exchange of plumage is reversed, and the young female doffs the
temporary black dress of the male for the brown one of the adult female,
instead of vice versâ.

All cuckoos, however, are not parasitic, the species known as LARK-HEELED
CUCKOOS--from the presence of a long, spine-like claw on the hind
toe--building a nest and hatching their own eggs. They have a wide range,
being found in Africa from Egypt to Cape Colony, Madagascar, India, China,
New Guinea, and Australia.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

YOUNG CUCKOO.

A young cuckoo remains in the nest till fully fledged.]

As a rule, the Cuckoos are not conspicuously coloured, but some species are
clad in a livery resplendent with metallic colours. These are represented
by the Indian and Australian BRONZE CUCKOOS and the African GOLDEN CUCKOOS.
One of the most beautiful of all is the African EMERALD CUCKOO, in which
the upper-parts are of a vivid emerald-green, whilst the under-parts are
bright yellow.

Finally, we must mention the GROUND-CUCKOOS, which are comparatively
long-legged, terrestrial forms, with small wings. One of the best known is
an inhabitant of the Southern United States, from Texas to New Mexico,
Southern Colorado, and California. "It has obtained the name of
ROAD-RUNNER," writes Dr. Sharpe, "from the speed with which it flies over
the ground, some idea of which may be gained from a statement of Colonel
Stevenson, that, when in Southern California, he saw, on two occasions, the
ranchmen of that part of the country chase one of these birds on horseback
for a distance of a mile or more at full speed, when the cuckoo, though
still in advance, would suddenly stop and fly up among the upper limbs of
some stunted tree or bush near the roadside, and the rider, having kept the
bird in view all the way, would dismount and easily take the exhausted bird
from its perch alive."

That the African PLANTAIN-EATERS, or TOURACOS, are related to the Cuckoos
there can be no doubt, although they do not bear any very close superficial
resemblance to them. Striking in appearance and of beautiful plumage, they
owe as much of the interest which now centres on them to the chemist as to
the ornithologist. Long ago it was noticed that the rich crimson colour of
the wing-quills disappeared after exposure to a heavy rain, having been
apparently washed out--a supposition justified by the discovery still later
that the water in which captive species had been bathing was strongly
tinged with colour. A little more than thirty years ago these facts came
under the notice of Professor Church, who, as a result of a thorough
examination of the mystery, was enabled to announce the discovery of a new
animal pigment containing copper, which he called "turacin."

YOUNG CUCKOO IN REED-WARBLER'S NEST.

This photograph was taken in August, an unusually late date to find these
birds in the nest.]

There are twenty-five different species of plantain-eaters, which are
divided into two groups--those which have red in the quills and those
without. All are forest-dwellers, feeding upon various wild fruits,
building a nest of sticks resembling that of a pigeon, and laying therein
three white eggs. The majority of the species are crested and brilliantly
coloured, but a few are quite soberly clad. The largest of the tribe is
nearly 3 feet long, and a brief description of its coloration will serve to
convey a notion of the beauty of the more gorgeously clad members. In this
species, then, the upper surface of the body is blue, the tail yellow, with
a blue base and black bar across the tip, the under surface of the body
rufous brown, the bill yellow, with a scarlet tip, and the eye red.

Though the tops of the highest trees seem to be their favourite resort,
these birds are found also among the dense tangled masses of creepers near
the ground, flitting, when disturbed, in graceful curves, and alighting
with crest erected and the tail turned sharply upwards. The powers of
flight appear to vary among the different species, some being described as
decidedly clumsy on the wing, whilst others, on the contrary, are light and
graceful. Shy and very restless, they are very difficult to procure, when
wounded running with great speed, and taking shelter in holes in trees.
Their flesh is esteemed a great delicacy by the natives. Save during rain
or the heat of midday, they appear to be very noisy birds, having a harsh
note, varied with cat-like mewings.

CHAPTER XII.

_ROLLERS, KINGFISHERS, HORNBILLS, AND HOOPOES._


Crow-like birds of brilliant coloration, the ROLLERS have earned their name
from the habit of occasionally rolling or turning over in their flight,
after the manner of tumbler-pigeons. One species at least visits Britain
occasionally, only to be shot down at once by the insatiable pot-hunter and
collector of rare birds. They are birds of wide distribution, occurring
over the greater part of the Old World, and, as we have already remarked,
of brilliant coloration, blue and green, varied with reddish, being the
predominating colours. As with all birds of beautiful plumage, they are
subjected to much persecution, thousands upon thousands being killed every
year in India alone, to supply the demands made by milliners for the
decoration of ladies' hats.

AUSTRALIAN LAUGHING-KINGFISHER.

The Laughing-kingfisher, or Laughing-jackass, derives its name from its
extraordinary note, resembling a demoniacal laugh.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

KINGFISHERS AT HOME.

The plumage of this bird is remarkable for the beauty of its iridescent
hues.]

Rollers frequent forest country, and travel in pairs or in small companies:
some species are entirely insectivorous; others eat also reptiles, frogs,
beetles, worms, and grain. Four or five white eggs are laid in a nest made
of roots, grass, hair, and feathers, and built in walls, under the eaves of
buildings, or in holes of trees or banks.

Equally beautiful as a whole, and far more widely known, are the
KINGFISHERS. But just as the common cuckoo has come to overshadow the rest
of its tribe, so the COMMON KINGFISHER eclipses all its congeners. For
centuries a wealth of fable, held together by a modicum of fact, served to
secure for this bird a peculiar interest; whilst to-day, though shorn of
much of the importance with which these fables had invested it, this
kingfisher is still esteemed one of the most interesting and beautiful of
its tribe.

Green and blue are the predominating colours of its upper- and bright
chestnut-red of its under-surface; but owing to structural peculiarities of
the feathers of the upper-parts, the reflection of the green and blue areas
changes with the direction of the light from which the bird is viewed, in
the same way that the peacock's train-feathers change according as the
light falls upon them.

As is the rule where both sexes are brilliantly coloured, this bird breeds
in a hole, which in the present species is generally excavated in the bank
of a stream, but sometimes in an old gravel-pit or chalk-pit, a mile or
even more from the water. Occasionally the crumbling soil under the roots
of an old tree affords sufficient shelter. No nest is made, although what
is equivalent to a nest is ultimately formed from the bird's habit of
ejecting the indigestible parts of its food on to the floor of the space in
which the eggs are laid. In course of time this becomes a cup-shaped
structure; but whether, as Professor Newton remarks, by the pleasure of the
bird or the moisture of the soil, or both, is unknown. With care the nest
may be removed entire, but the slightest jar reduces the whole to the
collection of fish-bones and crustacean skeletons of which it was
originally composed. There is a tradition, not yet extinct, to the effect
that these "nests" are of great pecuniary value, and scarcely a year passes
without the authorities at the British Museum being offered such a
treasure, at prices varying from a few pounds to a hundred. The
nest-chamber is approached by a tunnel sloping upwards, and varying from 8
inches to 3 feet in length, terminating in a chamber some 6 inches in
diameter, in which the eggs are laid. These, from six to eight in number,
have a pure white, shining shell, tinged with a most exquisite pink colour,
which is lost when the eggs are blown.

The young seem to be reared under very unsanitary conditions, for the
ejected fish-bones and other hard parts are not reserved entirely for the
nest, but gradually distributed along the tunnel approaching it; later,
fish brought for the young, but dropped on the way, and the fluid excreta
of the parents are added, forming a dripping, fetid mass swarming with
maggots. The young, on leaving the nest, are at first tenderly fed and
cared for by the parents, but towards the end of the summer seem to be
driven away to seek new fishing-grounds for themselves.

Of the many legends that have grown up around this bird, some are well
worth repeating. Specially interesting is one related by Professor Newton
on the authority of the French naturalist Rolland. This has it that the
kingfisher was originally a plain grey bird, and acquired its present
bright colours by flying towards the sun on its liberation from Noah's ark,
when its upper-surface assumed the hue of the sky above it, and its lower
plumage was scorched by the heat of the setting sun to the tint it now
bears. Not a few virtues were also attributed to this bird. Its dried body
would, it was believed, avert thunder-bolts, or, kept in a wardrobe,
preserve from moths the woollen stuffs contained therein, whilst, hung by a
thread from the ceiling of a room, it would serve like the more
conventional weather-cock to point the direction of the prevailing wind.

Persecuted though it is, the kingfisher is by no means a rare bird in
England, and those who will may generally see it by the banks of some
slowly flowing stream or lake, or even shallow brook, sometimes even by the
seashore. It feeds upon small aquatic insects and crustacea and small
fishes, sometimes even, it is said, upon leeches. Perched on some bough
overhanging the water, or stump or railing on the bank, it watches
patiently, silent and motionless. The moment its prey comes within striking
distance it plunges down upon it, disappearing for a moment beneath the
surface, to appear the next with its capture in its beak. If this be a
fish, it is held crosswise, and borne upwards to the station from which the
plunge was made, there to be stunned by a few sharp blows, tossed into the
air, dexterously caught, and swallowed head-foremost. At times, however,
perhaps when hunger presses, more activity in the capture of food is
displayed, the bird hovering suspended over the water, after the custom of
the kestrel-hawk.

Although essentially fish-eating birds, a considerable number live far
removed from water, obtaining a livelihood by the capture of insects in
forest regions, whilst some appear to feed mainly on reptiles. These are
known as Wood-kingfishers, to distinguish them from the Water-kingfishers,
the typical member of which group has been just described.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

LAUGHING-KINGFISHERS.

This species has comparatively dull-coloured plumage.]

Of the WOOD-KINGFISHERS, or KINGHUNTERS, as they are also called, the most
beautiful are the RACKET-TAILED KINGFISHERS, so called from the fact that
the two middle tail-feathers are produced into two long rods, terminating
in a spoon-shaped enlargement. Although represented by no less than twenty
distinct species, they have a somewhat limited range, being found only in
the Moluccas, New Guinea, and Northern Australia. One of the handsomest of
all is the one occurring in Amboina, an island in the Malay Archipelago,
where it was discovered by Mr. A. R. Wallace. The bill, he tells us, is
coral-red, the under-surface pure white, the back and wings deep purple,
while the shoulders, head, and nape, and some spots on the upper part of
the back and wings, are pure azure-blue. The tail is white, narrowly edged
with blue. These birds live upon insects and small land-mollusca, which
they dart down upon and pick up from the ground just as the fish-eating
species pick up a fish.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

KINGFISHER.

The photograph shows the nature of the favourite haunts of this species.]

Of the forest-haunting species, however, the best known is probably the
large and, for a kingfisher, dull-coloured LAUGHING-JACKASS, or SETTLER'S
CLOCK, of Australia. Its food is of a very mixed character--small mammals,
reptiles, insects, and crabs being devoured with equal relish. Since it is
not seldom to be seen bearing off a snake in its bill, it may be regarded
as a useful bird--supposing, of course, the snake to be of a poisonous
variety. A good idea of the bird in its native haunts is given by the late
Mr. Wheelwright. "About an hour before sunrise," he writes, "the bushman is
awakened by the most discordant sounds, as if a troop of fiends were
shouting, whooping, and laughing around him in one wild chorus. This is the
morning song of the 'laughing-jackass,' warning his feathered mates that
daybreak is at hand. At noon the same wild laugh is heard, and as the sun
sinks into the west it again rings through the forest. I shall never forget
the first night I slept in the open bush in this country. It was in the
Black Forest. I woke about daybreak after a confused sleep, and for some
minutes I could not remember where I was, such were the extraordinary
sounds that greeted my ears: the fiendish laugh of the jackass, the clear,
flute-like notes of the magpie, the hoarse cackle of the wattle-birds ...
and the screaming of thousands of parrots as they dashed through the
forest, all giving chorus, formed one of the most extraordinary concerts I
have ever heard, and seemed, at the moment, to have been got up for the
purpose of welcoming the stranger to this land of wonders on that eventful
morning. I have heard it hundreds of times since, but never with the same
feelings that I listened to it then. The laughing-jackass is the bushman's
clock, and being by no means shy, of a companionable nature, and a constant
attendant on the bush-tent and a destroyer of snakes, is regarded, like the
robin at home, as a sacred bird in the Australian forests. It is an
uncouth-looking bird ... nearly the size of a crow, of a rich
chestnut-brown and dirty white colour, the wings slightly chequered with
light blue, after the manner of the British jay. The tail-feathers are
long, rather pointed, and barred with brown.... It is a common bird in all
the forest throughout the year, breeds in the hole of a tree, and the eggs
are white."

Whilst the Kingfishers are remarkable for the wondrous beauty of their
coloration, the HORNBILLS, their allies, attract our attention rather by
the grotesqueness of their shape, due to the enormous size of the bill, and
the still more remarkable horny excrescences which surmount it in not a few
species, forming what is known as a "casque." Absent in some of the smaller
and possibly more primitive forms, its gradual development may be traced,
beginning with a series of corrugations along the ridge of the base of the
bill, gradually increasing, to form, in the most extreme cases, huge
superstructures of quaint shapes, and apparently of great solidity. As a
matter of fact, however, these casques are practically hollow, save in the
case of the HELMET-HORNBILL of the Malay countries, in which the horny
sheath is backed by solid supports of bone, whilst the front of the sheath
itself is of great thickness and surprising density, and is used by the
natives for carving and making brooches and other ornaments. The use of
this powerful hammer--for such it may possibly be--is unknown.

Hornbills are forest-birds, feeding upon fruit and insects, the latter
being captured on the wing. With large bill and wings, a long tail, and a
relatively small body and short legs, they are rather unwieldy birds, and
yet, for many reasons, unusually interesting. Their nesting habits are
unique, and quite worth recounting here at some length. Of the many
accounts, one of the most interesting, as well as one of the latest, is
that of Mr. Charles Hose, of Borneo.

LAUGHING-JACK ASS.

Frequently known as the Settler's Clock.]

"The nest," he writes, "is always built in the hollow of a large tree--the
hollow, be it noted, being always due to disease of the tree or the ravages
of termites, not to the personal labours of the birds. The bottom of this
cavity is often plugged by a termites' nest and accumulation of decayed
wood, and on the upper surface of this is made the nest, a very
rough-and-ready structure, composed simply of the feathers of the female.
The hollow of the tree communicates with the exterior air by means of a
long aperture, which, just before the period of incubation, is closed up
almost entirely by the male, simply leaving a long slit open, up and down
which the beak of the enclosed female can move. The substance used in thus
closing the aperture closely resembles some vegetable resin, and is
probably composed of a gastric secretion, combined with the woody fragments
of fruit. It should be noticed that this slit is always in close proximity
to the nest, so that the female can easily protrude her beak for food
without moving from her sitting position. During incubation the male bird
supplies the female with food in the form of pellets of fruit, seeds,
insects, portions of reptiles, etc., the pellets being enclosed each in a
skin of rubber-like consistency. While feeding the female, the male clings
to the bark of the tree, or sits on a branch if conveniently near, and
jerks these pellets into the gaping beak of the hen, two to four pellets
forming a meal. During mastication (for it is a mistake to suppose that the
hornbills always bolt their food entire) some fragments of the pellets fall
to the ground, and seeds which these fragments may contain take root,
germinate, and sprout, and the natives can judge approximately of the date
of incubation by the age of the seedlings. When these are four-leaved, the
eggs have been hatched out for two or three weeks. At this stage, though
not always so early, the mother bird leaves the nest, breaking down the
gluey substance with her beak to effect an exit; having left the nest, the
aperture through which she left is carefully closed up again, leaving the
slit as before, and now both male and female devote their energies to
feeding the young birds, which in course of time follow the example of
their mother and leave their place of imprisonment. It is more than
probable that this gluing up first of the mother bird and her eggs and
afterwards of the nestlings alone is solely a means of protection against
predacious carnivora....

CRESTED HORNBILL.

The Hornbills derive their name from the great size of the bill.]

"The nesting-season is during May and June, and it is noteworthy that the
birds, if undisturbed, return to the same nesting-place every year. The
saplings at the foot of the tree, sprung from seeds dropped in the first
year of paring, afford signs to the natives of the number of years during
which the tree has been occupied. If during paring or incubation the female
or female and young are destroyed, the male takes to himself another mate,
and repairs to the same nesting-place; if, however, the male and female are
destroyed, the nest is never reoccupied by other pairs. An interesting
incident was observed while on Mount Dulit. Espying on a tree the external
signs of a hornbill's nest, and a male rhinoceros perched close by, I shot
the male, and while waiting for my Dyak collectors to make a ladder up the
tree to secure the female, I observed several young male birds fly to the
nest and assiduously ply the bereaved widow with food, a fact which seems
to indicate a competition in the matrimonial market of the bird-world as
severe as that among human beings. It is no easy matter to procure embryos
or nestlings of hornbills, for the natives are inordinately fond of both as
articles of diet, and, further, are always anxious to secure the
tail-feathers of the adults to adorn their war-coats and hats.

"The native method of catching the female during incubation is ingenious,
though decidedly brutal. The tree is scaled, the resin-like substance is
broken away, and the frightened bird flies from her nest up the hollow
trunk of the tree, but is ignominiously brought down by means of a thorny
stick (the thorns point downward), which is thrust after and twisted about
until a firm grip in her plumage is obtained. The Dyaks, never very
faithful observers of nature, believe that the female is shut up by the
male, so that after hatching her eggs she may die, the maggots in her
putrefying body affording food for the young. One very curious habit of the
rhinoceros-hornbill which I have not hitherto seen noted is the rapid
jumping up and down on a branch with both feet together. This jumping
motion is imitated by the Kyans and Dyaks in their dances, the figure being
known to the Kyans as 'wan blingong.'"

CONCAVE-CASQUED HORNBILL, INDIA.

The noise made by hornbills on the wing is said to resemble that of a
steam-engine.]

That the HOOPOES, unlike as they may be in general appearance, are
nevertheless intimately related to the Hornbills there can be no doubt.
Graceful in contour and pleasing in coloration, it is a pity that the
species which so frequently visits Britain, and has on more than one
occasion nested there, should be so ruthlessly shot down immediately its
presence is discovered. Save the wings and tail, the body is of a light
cinnamon colour, whilst the head is surmounted by a magnificent crest of
black-and-white-tipped feathers, which can be raised or depressed at the
pleasure of the bird: the excepted portions of the plumage--the wings and
tail--are buff, varied with bands of black and white. Thus it may be
truthfully said to be a conspicuously coloured bird; yet this same livery
seems also to come under the head of protective coloration, for we are
assured that, when danger threatens, the bird throws itself flat upon the
ground, spreads out its wings, and at once becomes transformed into what
rather resembles a heap of rags than a bird. Escape by flight, however,
instead of subterfuge, seems also at times to be resorted to, since, when
pursued by a falcon, it will mount rapidly to a great height, and not
seldom effect its escape.

GROUND-HORNBILL.

The legs of the ground-hornbill are much longer than those of its allies.]

The domestic habits of the hoopoe are, however, by no means so charming as
one would expect to find in so beautiful a bird. "All observers agree,"
writes Professor Newton, "in stating that it delights to find its food
among filth of the most abominable description, and this especially in its
winter quarters. But where it breeds, its nest--usually in the hole of a
tree or of a wall--is not only partly composed of the foulest materials,
but its condition becomes worse as incubation proceeds, for the hen
scarcely ever leaves her eggs, being assiduously fed by the cock as she
sits (a feature strongly recalling the custom of the hornbills), and when
the young are hatched their fæces are not removed by their parents, as is
the case with most birds, but are discharged in the immediate neighbourhood
of the nest, the unsanitary condition of which can readily be imagined.
Worms, grubs, and insects generally, form the hoopoes' food, and upon it
they get so fat in autumn that they are esteemed a delicate morsel in some
of the countries of Southern Europe, and especially by the Christian
population of Constantinople."

HOOPOE.

An occasional visitor to the British Isles.]

Beside the EUROPEAN HOOPOE, which also extends into Northern Africa, four
other species are known, three of which are African, whilst a fourth ranges
from India to Hainan.

Nearly related to the birds we have just described are the WOOD-HOOPOES.
They differ from their allies in being crestless, having a more curved
bill, and a plumage of metallic purple, with a white patch on the wings and
white markings on the tail. Their habits resemble those of their more
highly coloured relatives.

CHAPTER XIII.

_BEE-EATERS, MOTMOTS, TODIES, COLIES, AND TROGONS._


In the present chapter we deal with a number of birds of singular beauty
and gracefulness. In their coloration green predominates, thus recalling
the Rollers, Parrots, Plantain-eaters, and Kingfishers, all of which
groups, as we have seen, contain a large proportion of green species.

The BEE-EATERS, like the Kingfishers, Hornbills, and Hoopoes, have a foot
of quite peculiar structure, the middle and outer toes being joined
together throughout the greater part of their length. They are an Old World
group, ranging from the British Islands to Australia, in the American
Continent their place being taken by the Motmots and Jacamars, of which we
shall speak presently. They are especially plentiful in the African region,
somewhat less so in the Indian, the temperate regions of the Old World
possessing but few species.

On rare occasions one species visits the British Islands. This is,
furthermore, one of the most beautiful of the group. It has the head, neck,
upper back, and a broad wing-bar of a ruddy-brown colour; the lower back
buff colour; green wings and tail, with black tips to the middle
tail-feathers, which are longer than the rest. The forehead is pale green
and white; the ear-coverts are black; and the throat bright yellow, divided
from the greenish-blue under-parts by a black band. "The name Bee-eater,"
writes Mr. Evans, "is well deserved, for in Spain [it] is a perfect pest to
the bee-keeper, catching the workers as they enter and leave the hives."
Like the Kingfishers, the indigestible parts of the food are cast up and
deposited around the eggs, though bee-eaters do not appear to form a nest
of them, as with the Kingfishers.

From four to six eggs of a beautiful glossy white colour are deposited in
holes in banks, or--and this is worthy of special notice--in tunnels bored
vertically downwards in level ground for a distance of from 3 to 10 feet.
How this is done is a mystery, for the bird's beak and feet look by no
means equal to such a task. No nest appears to be made, the eggs being
deposited at the extremity of the burrow without further preparation. Two
species of the group, however, are said to form an exception, constructing
a nest of straw and feathers. These two, as well as the members of the
genus to which the British bird belongs, apparently breed in colonies.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BEE-EATER.

A native of the Malay countries. The long feathers on the throat are bright
scarlet.]

Unfortunately for the bee-eater, its flesh is palatable, whilst its plumage
is in great demand for millinery purposes. Its persecution is of long
standing, since more than 300 years ago Belon witnessed a particularly
cruel experiment practised by the boys in Crete. Transfixing a beetle with
a bent pin, to the head of which a thread was tied, and then holding its
other end with their hand, they would let the insect fly. The bee-eater,
which catches most of its prey on the wing, would dart upon it, and,
swallowing the bait, be caught by the hook.

Not unlike the Bee-eaters in general appearance and coloration, the MOTMOTS
are birds of peculiar interest, and this on account of a remarkable habit
of one of their tribe--a habit which is perfectly unique, and to which we
shall return presently. Belonging, as we have already remarked, to the New
World, they range from Southern Mexico to Paraguay, inhabiting dense
forests, and being but rarely seen. The plumage is somewhat loose in
character--green, blue, cinnamon, and black in colour. The beak has the
margins serrated, or saw-like; whilst the feet resemble those of the
Kingfishers and Bee-eaters. As with the Bee-eaters, no nest is made. The
eggs, three or four in number and creamy white in colour, are deposited in
a hole bored by the birds themselves in a tree or bank, both sexes sharing
in the work of incubation. Their food consists of insects caught in the
air, small reptiles, and fruit.

The remarkable habit to which we have referred is displayed by the species
known as the RACKET-TAILED MOTMOT, from the fact that the two middle
tail-feathers project beyond the others, and have the greater part of the
shaft bare, but terminating in a spoon-shaped expansion. In this there is
nothing unusual, for such racket-feathers are common amongst birds. In this
particular case, however, the feathers were originally entire, and acquired
their characteristic shape artificially, the bird nibbling away the vane on
either side of the shaft with its bill until the required shape is
obtained. Such an act of conscious decoration on the part of a bird is
elsewhere unknown throughout the whole class.

The TODIES are diminutive allies of the Motmots, frequenting hilly
districts and woods. They sit with the beak pointed upwards, the head drawn
in close to the body, and the plumage puffed out, apparently oblivious of
all around them--at least it would seem so, since at such times they may be
caught with a butterfly-net. Like their larger allies, they are green in
coloration, but have a light red throat, and yellowish-white or pinkish
under-parts, with green or pink flank-feathers. They vary in length from 3
to 4½ inches.

The COLIES, or MOUSE-BIRDS, of South Africa are small, crested,
long-tailed, loose-plumaged birds whose exact relationships are somewhat
puzzling. The name Mouse-bird is given on account of the habit of creeping
along the boughs of trees with the whole foot applied to the branch. The
toes are peculiar in that all turn forwards, and are commonly so retained.
About ten species are known, ranging from Abyssinia southwards.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

RACKET-TAILED MOTMOT.

Note the mutilated tail-feathers.]

Resplendent without doubt are the majority of the forms which we have been
lately considering, but probably the palm for gorgeous coloration should be
given to the TROGONS--at least they must be allowed to share the honours
with the Humming-birds.

The most splendid of all is the QUEZAL, the male of which has a train of
great length, resembling at first sight a tail. But, as in the peacock,
this is formed by enormously elongated tail-coverts, concealing the true
tail. These tail-coverts differ, however, markedly from those in the
peacock in that they are not erectile, but pendent. The head is ornamented
with a large, rounded crest; the ground-colour of the upper parts of the
plumage is of brilliant metallic green; the under parts from the chest
downwards are of a deep blood-red. Certain of the covert-feathers of the
wing form elegant drooping plumes, hanging down on either side and giving a
wonderfully beautiful effect.

The late Mr. Salvin's account of this bird in its wild state is well worth
quoting. Hunting with a native for this bird in the forest, where alone it
is to be met with, he writes: "A distant clattering note indicates that the
bird is on the wing. He settles--a splendid male--on a bough of a tree, not
seventy yards from where we are hidden. Cipriano wants to creep up to
within shot, but I keep him back, wishing to risk the chance of losing a
specimen rather than miss such an opportunity of seeing the bird in its
living state, and of watching its movements. It sits almost motionless on
its perch, the body remaining in the same position, the head only moving
from side to side. The tail is occasionally jerked open and closed again,
and now and then slightly raised, causing the long tail-coverts to vibrate
gracefully. I have not seen all. A ripe fruit catches the quezal's eye, and
he darts from his perch, hovers for a moment, picks the berry, and returns
to his former position. This is done with a degree of elegance that defies
description."

CHAPTER XIV.

_TOUCANS, HONEY-GUIDES, JACAMARS AND PUFF-BIRDS, BARBETS AND WOODPECKERS._


Gaudy in plumage, and somewhat ungainly in appearance, it must nevertheless
be admitted that the TOUCANS form an exceedingly interesting group of
birds. On account of their huge and gaily coloured beaks, they have been
imagined to be related to the Hornbills; but even judging by this
character, the two groups may be readily distinguished; for whereas the
typical beak of the hornbill is surmounted by a large casque, the beak of
the toucan is never so ornamented. The solid appearance of the beak in the
toucan, by the way, is as much a fiction as with the hornbill, since the
horny sheath is supported, not on a core of solid bone, but on a frame of
delicate bony filigree-work, the spaces being filled by air. The coloration
of the plumage (which is somewhat loose in character), as well as of the
bare skin round the eye and the beak-sheath, is most brilliant, and
displays immense variation amongst the different species.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

TROGON.

Trogons haunt the recesses of the thickest forests.]

Shy and restless in their habits, toucans travel generally in small flocks
amongst the forest-trees and mangrove-swamps in search of food, which
consists mainly of fruits and seeds, varying this diet occasionally with
ants and caterpillars. It is to this diet of fruit that the great size of
the bill and its peculiar saw-like edges are to be traced--at least this is
the opinion of the great traveller-naturalist Bates, who had so many
opportunities of watching these birds. "Flowers and fruit," he writes, "on
the crowns of the large trees of South American forests grow principally
towards the end of slender twigs, which will not bear any considerable
weight. All animals, therefore, which feed principally upon fruit, or on
insects contained in flowers, must, of course, have some means of reaching
the ends of the stalks from a distance. Monkeys obtain their food by
stretching forth their long arms, and in some instances their tails, to
bring the fruit near to their mouths; humming-birds are endowed with highly
perfected organs of flight, with corresponding muscular development, by
which they are enabled to sustain themselves on the wing before blossoms
whilst rifling them of their contents; [and the long bill of the toucan
enables it] to reach and devour fruit whilst remaining seated, and thus to
counterbalance the disadvantage which its heavy body and gluttonous
appetite would otherwise give it in the competition with allied groups of
birds."

Toucans appear to be much esteemed as articles of food--at least during the
months of June and July, when these birds get very fat, the flesh being
exceedingly sweet and tender. They nest in holes of trees at a great height
from the ground, and lay white eggs.

One of the most remarkable of the group is the CURL-CRESTED TOUCAN, from
the fact that the feathers on the crown of the head are peculiarly modified
to form scroll-like, glossy curls, which have been compared to shavings of
steel or ebony. Mr. Bates writes: "I had an amusing adventure one day with
one of these birds. I had shot one from a rather high tree in a dark glen
in the forest, and entered the thicket where the bird had fallen to secure
my booty. It was only wounded, and on my attempting to seize it set up a
loud scream. In an instant, as if by magic, the shady nook seemed alive
with these birds, although there was certainly none visible when I entered
the jungle. They descended towards me, hopping from bough to bough, some of
them swinging on the loops and cables of woody lianas, and all croaking and
fluttering their wings like so many furies. If I had had a long stick in my
hand, I could have knocked several of them over. After killing the wounded
one, I began to prepare for obtaining more specimens and punishing the
viragos for their boldness. But the screaming of their companion having
ceased, they remounted the trees, and before I could reload every one of
them had disappeared."

With neither charm of colour nor peculiar shape, the small African birds
known as HONEY-GUIDES are some of the most remarkable of birds, and this on
account of a quite unique habit of inducing other animals, not even
excepting man, to hunt for them. Sir John Kirk, writing of its habits in
the Zambesi district, says: "The honey-guide is found in forests and often
far from water, even during the dry season. On observing a man, it comes
fluttering from branch to branch in the neighbouring trees, calling
attention. If this be responded to--as the natives do by whistling and
starting to their feet--the bird will go in a certain direction, and remain
at a little distance, hopping from one tree to another. On being followed,
it goes further; and so it will guide the way to a nest of bees. When this
is reached, it flies about, but no longer guides; and then some knowledge
is required to discover the nest, even when pointed out to within a few
trees. I have known this bird, if the man, after taking up the direction
for a little, then turns away, come back and offer to point out another
nest in a different part. But if it does not know of two nests, it will
remain behind. The difficulty is that the bird will point to tame bees in a
bark hive as readily as to those in the forest. This is natural, as the bee
is the same, the bark hive ... being simply fastened up in a tree, and left
for the bees to come to.... The object the bird has in view is clearly the
young bees. It will guide to nests having no honey, and seems equally
delighted if the comb containing the grubs is torn out, when it is seen
pecking at it."

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

CURL-CRESTED TOUCAN.

So called from the curiously curled feathers on the head, resembling black
and glistening shavings.]

An old rumour had it that honey-guides occasionally lured men on to spots
where lions or other large and dangerous beasts lay hid. No credence
whatever is now given to such tales, it being readily understood that the
bird's course may by accident pass directly above perils of this kind,
without the slightest cognisance of this on the part of the bird.

The honey-guide, however, presses into its service one of the lower
mammals--the ratel. The fondness of this animal for bees is well known, and
by none better than this little bird, which, by pointing out nests to its
more powerful companion, earns as a reward the broken bits which remain
after the feast.

Allies of the sombre-coloured Honey-guides are the JACAMARS and PUFF-BIRDS.
The former are rather handsome birds, though small, having the upper-parts
of a metallic coppery golden green, and more or less rufous below. Ranging
from Mexico to South Brazil, they may usually be found on the outskirts of
forests, near water, sitting perched on the bare boughs of lofty trees for
hours at a time. They feed on moths and other insects, caught on the wing,
and brought back and crushed against the bough before swallowing. They lay
white eggs in the holes of trees.

The PUFF-BIRDS, though closely allied to the foregoing, are more soberly
clad. Black, brown, and rufous in hue, they lack the resplendent metallic
markings of the Jacamars. Their geographical range extends from Guatemala
and Honduras to Argentina. Though numerous species and genera are known,
the nest and eggs appear to have been discovered in the case of one species
only: these were found in a hole in a bank, and contained two shining white
eggs.

The BARBETS are possibly more closely related to the Honey-guides than the
Jacamars and Puff-birds. Brilliantly coloured, and having a plumage
exhibiting violent contrasts of red, blue, purple, and yellow, on a green
ground, sometimes with crests, bare skin round the eye, and brightly
coloured bills, the barbets are, in spite of a somewhat hairy appearance,
exceedingly attractive birds.

Forest-dwellers, like their allies, they feed upon fruit, seeds, insects,
bark, and buds; but so noiseless are they said to be when feeding that
their presence is betrayed only by the falling of berries they have
accidentally released.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

HONEY-GUIDE.

The name is bestowed on account of its remarkable habit of drawing
attention to bees' nests.]

It is interesting to note that the geographical range of the barbet is much
wider than that of its immediate allies, extending through tropical Asia,
Africa, and America.

The Woodpecker Tribe constitutes a large group, generally divided into two
sections--the WOODPECKERS and the WRYNECKS.

The former are characterised by their large heads and very powerful bills
and long and exceedingly stiff tails. The feet are also peculiar, two toes
pointing directly forwards and two backwards. Beak, feet, and tail are all
specially adapted to the peculiar habits of these birds, which pass their
lives upon trees, climbing the trunks, and searching the interstices of the
bark for ants, or drilling holes into the unsound portions of the trunk
itself for the purpose of extracting the grubs which feed upon decaying
wood.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

A FAMILY OF GREATER SPOTTED WOODPECKERS.

This woodpecker is a British species.]

That ants and other small insects form the staple diet of the woodpecker is
evident from the extraordinary length of the tongue. This is a long,
worm-like structure, capable of being protruded many inches from the beak,
and covered with a sticky secretion, so that, thrust into colonies of ants,
it quickly becomes covered with them, to be withdrawn immediately into the
mouth and cleared again for further action.

Woodpeckers are all birds of bright plumage, some particularly so, and have
a wide geographical distribution, inhabiting all parts of the world save
Madagascar, the Australasian region, and Egypt.

Three species occur in the British Islands, though they are exceedingly
rare in Scotland and Ireland. The GREEN WOODPECKER is a particularly
handsome bird. Grass-green is the predominating colour of its livery,
relieved by a light scarlet cap, a golden patch over the lower part of the
back, and chequered bars on the wings and quills.

Scarcely less beautiful, in their way, are the GREATER and LESSER SPOTTED
WOODPECKERS. The plumage of these birds has a very rich effect, steely
blue-black and white being contrasted with scarlet.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

LESSER SPOTTED WOODPECKERS

One of the members of the group is using its stiff tail feathers as a
support.]

The SPOTTED and BLACK WOODPECKERS are remarkable for a curious drumming
sound, so powerful as to be distinctly audible even a mile off. It appears
to be caused by hammering vigorously on the bark of some rotten branch, the
bird's head moving with amazing rapidity as it beats out this curious
tattoo.

Three North American species, known as SAP-SUCKERS, have the curious habit
of piercing the boles of trees for the purpose of procuring the sap which
flows copiously when the tree is so "tapped." Another species of the same
region seems to be possessed of a persistent dread of famine, storing up
immense quantities of nuts, which it appears never afterwards to use. These
nuts are tightly fixed into holes in the bark of trees, and in such numbers
that "a large pine 40 or 50 feet high will present the appearance of being
closely studded with brass nails, the heads only being visible."

The WRYNECKS differ from the Woodpeckers mainly in that the tail-feathers
are soft instead of spiny. Although sombre, the plumage is yet very
beautiful, having a velvety appearance, variegated with pearl-grey,
powdered or dusted over a general groundwork of nut-brown, buff, and grey.
Bars and fine lines add still more to the general effect, and render
description still more difficult. One species is common in England. It is
known also as the CUCKOO'S MATE and the SNAKE-BIRD. The former name is
given in allusion to the fact that it arrives with the cuckoo, the latter
from its strange habit of writhing its head and neck, and also on account
of its curious hissing note, made when disturbed on its nest. It has the
long, worm-like tongue of the woodpecker, but without a barbed tip.

The habit of writhing the head and neck often serves the wryneck in good
stead. Nesting in a hole in a tree, escape is difficult so soon as the
discoverer has come to close quarters. The untried egg-collector, for
instance, peering down into the nest, and seeing nothing distinctly, but
only a moving head, and hearing a hissing sound, imagines the hole to be
tenanted by a snake, and beats a hasty retreat, only to catch a glimpse, a
moment later, of the bird hurrying out of its perilous hiding-place. Should
he, however, discovering the true state of affairs, put down his hand and
seize the bird, it will adopt yet other resources. Clinging tightly to its
captor's finger, it will ruffle up its feathers, stretch out its neck, and
at the same time move it jerkily and stiffly about, and finally, closing
its eyes, hang downwards, as if dead. Then, before the puzzled captor has
had time to realise what has happened, it loosens its hold and takes
instant flight.

The young are easily, though rarely, tamed, and form extremely interesting
pets, feeding readily from the hand, and affording endless amusement by
their remarkable manner of capturing flies and other insects; but they do
not appear to live long in confinement.

The wryneck is one of the few birds which will persistently go on laying
eggs, no matter how many times they may be stolen from the nest. A case is
on record where as many as forty-two were laid in a single summer by one
bird--an exceedingly cruel experiment.

Waxbills are relatives of the Weaver birds, and take their name from the
waxen appearance of the beak which is coral red.]

CHAPTER XV.

_THE PERCHING-BIRDS._


Such an enormous host are included under this head--nearly 6,000 out of the
total of 13,000  known birds--and so great are the difficulties connected
with their systematic arrangement, that it has been considered best to
begin the present chapter with the highest instead of the lowest types of
the group.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

JACKDAWS.

It is believed that the jackdaw is the bird referred to by Shakespeare as
the Russet-pated Chough (_Midsummer-Night's Dream_, iii. 2).]

The extensive group of Perching-birds is defined mainly from the characters
afforded by the structure of the voice-organ, and these are of much too
technical a nature to be discussed here. Suffice it to say that, on account
of these characters, the group is further divided into two sections, and
each section again divided into two.


THE CROWS, ORIOLES, FINCHES, AND THEIR ALLIES.

At the head of the tribe stands, by general though by no means universal
consent, the Crow Family, of which the recognised chief is the RAVEN, a
bird which has for thousands of years commanded a more than passing
interest amongst mankind. Renowned as the truant from the Ark, or as the
wonderful minister of the prophet Elijah, there are few even of the
youngest amongst us who do not know of its striking personality. The poet
and the dramatist have both made use of the raven, and it would seem that
it has even found a place in the mythology of the Red Indian. The smaller
relatives of this celebrated bird, the ROOK, the CARRION-CROW, and the
JACKDAW, and more distantly the JAY and the MAGPIE, are doubtless as
familiar to our readers as the raven.

Although probably unknown to many, the CHOUGH, with its glossy black
plumage and brilliant red bill and feet, is a British bird, and lives still
in certain parts of England, though fast verging on extinction.

Another very remarkable member of the family is the HUIA, and this on
account of the fact that the male and female differ markedly in respect of
the shape of the bill, this being in the female long and sickle-shaped, and
in the male short and cone-shaped. This bird frequents the wooded regions
of North Island, New Zealand, living upon grubs found in decaying wood, and
on berries. The female procures the grubs by probing the holes which they
have made in the sounder wood, the male by breaking away the decayed
portions of the tree; but occasionally it happens that, having cleared away
as much of the decayed material as possible, the latter is unable to reach
his prey, in which case he calls up the female, and yields his find to her,
to extricate with her longer bill. So great a difference in the form of the
bill in the sexes of the same species is elsewhere unknown among birds.

YOUNG AMERICAN BLUE JAY (NATURAL SIZE).

The blue jay is a most remarkable mimic.]

The Crows hold the important position of head of the Class birds, yet they
are far outshone in splendour by many of the groups already examined,
though, with the exception perhaps of the Humming-birds, these all pale
before the BIRDS OF PARADISE.

Varying in size from a crow to a thrush, the best known of the latter is
the GREAT BIRD OF PARADISE, which was discovered towards the end of the
sixteenth century, if not earlier. On their first discovery it was
popularly supposed that these birds lived in the air, turning always to the
sun, and never alighting on the earth till they died, for they had neither
feet nor wings. Hence the Malay traders called them "God's Birds," the
Portuguese "Birds of the Sun," and the Dutch "Paradise-birds." Seventeen or
eighteen inches long, these birds have the body, wings, and tail of a rich
coffee-brown, which deepens on the breast to a blackish violet or
purple-brown. The top of the head and neck are of a delicate straw-yellow,
the feathers being short and close-set, resembling velvet. The
throat-feathers have a scaly appearance, and are emerald-green in colour.
The flank-feathers on either side of the body form a dense mass of long,
delicate, waving plumes, sometimes 2 feet in length, of an intense orange
colour, and shining with a wonderful gloss. These feathers can be raised
and spread out at pleasure, so as to almost conceal the wearer in a
fountain-like rain of feathers. This wonderful plumage is worn by the male
only, the female being quite plainly dressed. In May, when they are in full
dress, the males assemble early in the morning to exhibit themselves,
forming what are known as "dancing-parties," which take place on the
topmost boughs of some giant tree. "From a dozen to twenty birds assemble
together," writes Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, "raise up their wings, stretch
out their necks, and elevate their exquisite plumes, keeping them in
continual vibration. Between-whiles they fly across from branch to branch
in great excitement, so that the whole tree is filled with waxing plumes in
every variety of attitude and motion." The native hunter marks these
playing-places, builds a shelter of palm-leaves in a convenient situation
among the branches, and ensconces himself under it before daylight, armed
with a bow and a number of arrows terminating in a round knob. When the
dance is in full swing, he shoots through the roof of his shelter with the
blunt arrows, stunning every bird he strikes, which, falling down at once,
are immediately picked up by a boy in waiting below. Often a considerable
number will be thus secured before the alarm is taken.

A PAIR OF MAGPIES.

When taken young, the magpie is easily tamed, and can be taught to imitate
human sounds.]

Without coloured figures, or very numerous photographs from living birds,
which we can hardly hope to get, it would be impossible, except at the risk
of being wearisome, to describe all the wonderful combinations of form and
colour which the feathers of the birds of paradise display. Breast-shields
of metallic sheen, fans and crests in wonderful variety, feathers of a
texture like velvet, or gorgeous colours, confuse one in their variety and
combination. Let it suffice to mention only the last discovered
species--the KING OF SAXONY'S BIRD OF PARADISE. "Velvety black above,"
writes Dr. Sharpe, "and yellowish below, there is nothing very striking in
the aspect of the bird itself, which is smaller than our song-thrush. But
the 'streamers' which it carries! Poised ... on either side of the head is
a long, shaft-like plume, from which depends, on the lower side only, a
series of little flags of blue enamel, each quite separate from the one
which precedes it, and not of a feathery structure in the least."

CORNISH CHOUGH.

Very nearly extinct as a British bird.]

Close allies of the Birds of Paradise are the remarkable BOWER-BIRDS of
Australia. Conspicuously beautiful in coloration as are some members of
this tribe, they are celebrated not so much on this account as for an
extraordinary habit of constructing "bowers" or "playing-grounds"--a trait
which appears absolutely unique among birds. "These constructions,"
observes Mr. Gould, "consist in a collection of pieces of stick or grass,
formed into a bower; or one of them (that of the SPOTTED BOWER-BIRD) might
be called an avenue, being about 3 feet in length, and 7 or 8 inches broad
inside; a transverse section giving the figure of a horse-shoe, the round
part downwards. They are used by the birds as a playing-house, or 'run,' as
it is termed, and are used by the males to attract the females. The 'run'
of the SATIN-BIRD is much smaller, being less than 1 foot in length, and,
moreover, differs from that just described in being decorated with the
highly coloured feathers of the Parrot Tribe. The SPOTTED BOWER-BIRD, on
the other hand, collects around its 'run' a quantity of stones, shells,
bleached bones, etc.; they are also strewed down the centre within."

KING BIRD OF PARADISE.

A native of New Guinea; remarkable for the curled tail-feathers.]

More wonderful still are the structures reared by the GARDENER-BIRD of New
Guinea, presenting, as Professor Newton remarks, "not only a modification
of bower-building, but an appreciation of beauty perhaps unparalleled in
the animal world.... This species ... builds at the foot of a small tree a
kind of hut or cabin ... some 2 feet in height, roofed with orchid-stems
that slope to the ground, regularly radiating from the central support,
which is covered with a conical mass of moss, and sheltering a gallery
around it. One side of this hut is left open, and in front of it is
arranged a bed of verdant moss, bedecked with blossoms and berries of the
brightest colours. As these ornaments wither they are removed to a heap
behind the hut, and replaced by others that are fresh. The hut is circular
and some 3 feet in diameter, and the mossy lawn in front of it nearly twice
that expanse. Each hut and garden are, it is believed, though not known,
the work of a single pair of birds, or perhaps of the male only; and it may
be observed that this species, as its trivial name implies, is wholly
inornate in plumage. Not less remarkable is the more recently described
'bower' of the GOLDEN BOWER-BIRD.... This structure is said ... to be piled
up almost horizontally around the base of a tree to the height of from 4 to
6 feet, and around it are a number of hut-like fabrics, having the look of
a dwarfed native camp." Allied species, though building no bowers, yet
clear a space of ground some 8 or 9 feet in diameter, on which to display
themselves, and ornament this with little heaps of gaily tinted leaves,
replacing them as they fade with fresh specimens.

QUEENSLAND RIFLE-BIRD.

This unique Australian representative of the Birds of Paradise is about the
size of a pigeon. Its plumage is black with a purple sheen; the throat is
brilliant metallic emerald-green, like that of a humming-bird.]

We pass next to the birds of the Starling Family, of which the BRITISH
STARLING is the type. A bird so familiar needs no description here; but we
may draw attention to the many interesting phases of plumage this species
undergoes.

The first plumage is a uniform greyish brown. Later black feathers, with
large white spots at the tips, make their appearance among the brown. These
spotted feathers eventually replace the brown, and the bird enters upon a
second quite distinct phase--a black, spotted with white. Gradually this
gives place to a plumage entirely unspotted, the feathers on the breast
being spear-shaped. In the adult dress a wondrous variety of metallic
reflections is acquired--green, purple, and violet.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

RED BIRD OF PARADISE.

Found only on the small island of Waigiou, off the north-west coast of New
Guinea.]

Associating in the autumn and winter in large flocks, starlings move from
place to place in search of food. Sometimes the number of birds in these
combined flocks rises to an enormous figure. One of the largest of these
gatherings recorded in England existed on the property of the late Mr.
Miles near Bristol. "This locality is an evergreen plantation ... covering
some acres, to which these birds repair of an evening ... by millions, from
the low grounds about the Severn, where their noise and stench are
something altogether unusual. By packing in such myriads upon evergreens,
they have stripped them of their leaves, except just at the tops, and have
driven the pheasants, for whom the plantation was intended, quite away from
the ground. In the daytime, when the birds are not there, the stench is
still excessive. Mr. Miles was about to cut the whole plantation down, to
get rid of them, two years ago, but I begged him not to do so, on account
of the curiosity of the scene, and he has since been well pleased that he
abstained."

A similar but still larger congregation has been described; in this, about
the year 1845, from 150,000 to 200,000 starlings were computed to rest
every night, between the end of October and the end of March, in certain
trees in the gardens of the Zoological Society in Dublin. The roof of St.
Patrick's Cathedral, in the heart of Dublin, has from time to time been
resorted to, as many as 2,000  seeking shelter there. "Possessing very
considerable powers of wing," observes Yarrell, "these are turned to
account in an extraordinary manner by the birds composing the flock. They
wheel, close, open out, rise and descend, as if each were obeying a
commander, and all this is done with the utmost marvellous precision while
the flock is proceeding at a rapid pace through the air. At times it may
extend in a long and nearly straight thread; suddenly an undulation is
visible along the line, and in a moment it takes the form of a thin and
smoke-like cloud; another moment, and it is a dense and almost perfect
globe; then possibly, having preserved this appearance for a perceptibly
longer time, it becomes pear-shaped, and in another instant has assumed a
spiral figure; an instant after it has spread out like a sheet, and its
members are streaming softly along the ground, perhaps to alight, or
perhaps once more to mount aloft and circle as before." There are few more
magnificent sights in the world than a flock of starlings when performing
evolutions of this kind.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

YOUNG STARLINGS.

Starlings, if taken when young, are easily tamed and make excellent pets.]

Differing much, not only in general appearance, but also in coloration,
from the common starling is the ROSE-COLOURED STARLING, so called from the
beautiful rose-pink colour of the back and breast, set off by the rest of
the plumage, which is black, glossed with violet, blue, and green
reflections. This handsome bird occasionally visits Britain. Feeding
largely upon locusts, these birds are much affected in their movements by
the peregrinations of these pests; and this accounts for the sporadic
appearance of the rose-coloured starling in huge flocks in places where it
is generally seldom seen.

Dull in appearance, ungraceful in flight, and with a harsh, unmusical note,
the starling known as the OX-PECKER would seem at first sight to have
little to recommend it; yet it is one of the benefactors of the larger
African mammals, clearing them of flies and other insect-pests. Buffaloes,
rhinoceroses, elephants, are alike grateful for its services, as it climbs
about their huge bodies, picking off the liliputian enemies by which they
are beset. But little appears to be known of the breeding-habits of these
birds.

In strong contrast to the dull-looking Ox-birds are the beautiful GLOSSY
STARLINGS and GRACKLES. The AFRICAN GLOSSY STARLINGS, indeed, represent the
most beautiful of all the members of the Starling Tribe. In one of the
handsomest and best-known species--the LONG-TAILED GLOSSY
STARLING--metallic green and purple-violet are the predominating tones in
the plumage, glossed with copper reflections, and relieved by black or
darker bars of green and purple. In another species--the GREEN GLOSSY
STARLING of Eastern Africa--the shimmer of the plumage is so wonderful that
the exact shades of colour are difficult to describe, in that they change
completely, according to the light in which the bird is held.

The GRACKLES, or HILL-MYNAS, are Indian birds, with glossy black plumage,
relieved by bare flaps of yellow skin projecting backwards from the head
immediately behind the eye. These birds make excellent pets, learning both
to whistle and talk.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

COMMON STARLING.

Starlings appear to be on the increase in Scotland, whilst larks are said
to be on the decrease, owing to the destruction of their eggs by the
former.]

We come now to the beautiful ORIOLES--birds belonging to the temperate and
tropical parts of the Old World. The males, as a rule, are clad in a
vestment of brilliant yellow and black, but in some species the under-parts
are relieved by rich crimson. One species--the GOLDEN ORIOLE--has on
several occasions visited the British Islands, and even in one or two
instances has nested there. But, as with all brightly plumaged birds in
England, no sooner is their presence discovered than they are doomed to
fall to the gun of some local collector.

The HANG-NESTS, COW-BIRDS, and RICE-BIRDS are American birds, bearing in
many respects a resemblance to the Starlings, chiefly, perhaps, in the form
of the beak. Generally black in plumage, in many bright colour is
conspicuous.

HANG-NESTS range from North and Central America to Southern Brazil. As a
rule they are brilliantly coloured, the livery being bright orange and
yellow, set off by black and white. The majority of the numerous species
build remarkable nests, looking like long stockings, which they hang from
the under side of the bough of a tree; they are composed of coarse grass
deftly woven together.

The COW-BIRDS are mostly South American, though the United States possess
two or three species. Some, like the Cuckoos, are parasitic, dropping their
eggs into the nests of other birds, to be hatched by the owners: the young
cow-bird, however, dwells in harmony with his foster-brothers and -sisters,
instead of ejecting them from the nest, like the young cuckoo. The name
Cow-bird is bestowed upon these birds on account of the persistent way in
which they haunt herds of cattle for the sake of the flies which congregate
about those animals.

The RICE-BIRDS are represented by some rather showy forms, and others of
wonderful powers of song. The typical RICE-BIRD, or BOB-O-LINK, is an
especial favourite as a songster. Thoreau writes of this song: "It is as if
he [the bird] touched his harp with a wave of liquid melody, and when he
lifted it out the notes fell like bubbles from the strings.... Away he
launched, and the meadow is all bespattered with melody." Where rice is
extensively cultivated, however, this bird is by no means so
enthusiastically welcomed, causing immense destruction to the standing
crops--flocks numbering, it has been said, some millions alighting in the
fields and leaving too little grain to be worth the trouble of gathering.

We pass now to a group of exceedingly interesting birds, some of which are
remarkable on account of the beauty of their plumage, others from their
wonderful nesting-habits. The group includes many familiar as cage-birds,
such as the LONG-TAILED WIDOW-BIRDS, the RED-BEAKED WAXBILLS, AMADAVATS,
JAVA SPARROW, GRASS-FINCHES, MUNIAS, and so on, all of which are embraced
under the general title of WEAVER-BIRDS, a name bestowed on account of
their peculiar nests.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

MEADOW-LARK (NATURAL SIZE).

Known also as the Meadow-starling. This bird, a native of the Eastern
United States, has occurred three times in the British Islands, but it is
doubtful whether these specimens were wild.]

Abundant in Africa, and well represented in South-eastern Asia and
Australia, these birds bear a strong family resemblance to the Finches,
from which they differ in having ten primary quills in the wings.

One of the most peculiar is the South African LONG-TAILED WHYDAH- or
WIDOW-BIRD. Strikingly coloured, this bird is rendered still more
attractive by the extremely elongated tail-feathers, which are many times
longer than the body, so long, indeed, as to impede its flight, which is so
laboured that children commonly amuse themselves by running the bird down.
Kaffir children stretch lines coated with bird-lime near the ground across
fields of millet and Kaffir corn, and thereby capture many whose tails have
become entangled among the threads.

In brilliancy of coloration the Whydah-birds--for there are several
species--are pressed hard by the BISHOP-BIRDS, the handsomest of which is
the red species. Sociable in habits, this bird throughout the year consorts
in immense flocks, which in the summer consist chiefly of males.

Of the more remarkable nest-builders, the most conspicuous are the BAYA
SPARROWS, or TODDY-BIRDS, of India and Ceylon, and the SOCIABLE WEAVERS.
The former suspend their nests by a solidly wrought rope of fibre from the
under side of a branch, the rope expanding into a globular chamber, and
then again contracting into a long, narrow, vertical tube, through which
the birds make their exit and entrance. The latter--the SOCIABLE
WEAVER-BIRD of Africa--builds a still more wonderful structure. As a thing
apart it has no existence, a number of birds, varying from 100 to 300,
joining their nests together, so as to form a closely interwoven structure,
resembling, when finished, a gigantic mushroom. The structure is built
among the branches of large trees, so that the tree looks as though it had
grown up through a native hut, carrying the roof with it. Cartloads of
grass are required to rear this structure, which is nearly solid. Seen from
below, it presents a flat surface riddled with holes; these are the
entrances to the nests.

Closely resembling the typical Finches in general appearance, and often
gorgeous in coloration, is the group known as the TANAGERS, of which more
than 400 distinct species are known to science. Exclusively American, the
majority of the species are found in Central and South America, though a
few move northwards into the United States in summer. The most beautiful
are the SCARLET, CRIMSON-HEADED, and WHITE-CAPPED TANAGERS. The last-named
is generally allowed to be the loveliest of the group. The entire plumage
of both sexes is a beautiful cornflower-blue, surmounted by a cap of
silvery-white feathers, a crimson spot on the forehead looking like a drop
of blood. The identical coloration of the sexes is worth noting, as among
the tanagers generally the female is dull-coloured.

Among the Finches there is a considerable variety of coloration, though but
little in bodily form; they are all attractive birds, and have the
additional advantage that many are British. Distributed over both the
northern and temperate regions of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, they
are unknown in Australia. The group, which comprises a very large number of
species, may be divided into three sections--GROSBEAKS, TRUE FINCHES, and
BUNTINGS.

The GROSBEAKS, as their name implies, are characterised by the great
stoutness of the beak, and some, as the EVENING-GROSBEAKS of America, are
remarkable for their beauty.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

HAWFINCH.

A resident in the eastern and midland counties of England.]

Well-known British members of this section are the HAWFINCHES and
GREENFINCHES. Common in many parts of England, though rare in Scotland and
Ireland, the HAWFINCH contrives to make itself much disliked by the
gardener, owing to its fondness for peas, though it fully compensates for
the damage done in this direction by the numbers of noxious insects it
destroys. The nest is a very beautiful structure; outside it is composed of
twigs intermixed with lichens, inside of dry grasses lined with fine roots
and hair. The site chosen varies, a favourite place being an old apple- or
pear-tree in an orchard; but the woods and fir plantations are not seldom
resorted to. The GREENFINCH is an equally common British bird. Of a more
confiding disposition than the hawfinch, it makes an excellent cage-bird,
becoming with judicious treatment exceedingly tame. It is a useful bird,
travelling during the autumn and winter in large flocks, and feeding on the
seeds of wild mustard and other weeds. Its nest differs conspicuously from
that of the hawfinch, being a somewhat untidy structure, composed of
fibrous roots, moss, and wool, lined with finer roots, horsehair, and
feathers.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

YOUNG CHAFFINCHES.

The chaffinch is one of the commonest of the British finches.]

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

HOUSE-SPARROWS.

The sparrow is to be reckoned among the few really harmful British birds.]

Among the TRUE FINCHES, distinguished from the Grosbeaks by their less
powerful bills, are several other well-known British birds. Of these, none
are better known than the CHAFFINCH. Gay in appearance and sprightly in
habit, this is a general favourite everywhere, and much in demand as a
cage-bird. His short though delightful song possesses a peculiar charm,
coming as it does with the earliest signs of returning spring. The
fascination of this song has never been better expressed than in Browning's
lines:--

  O to be in England
  Now that April's there;
  And whoever wakes in England
  Sees, some morning, unaware,
  That the lowest boughs of the brushwood sheaf
  Round the elm-tree hole are in tiny leaf,
  While the Chaffinch sings on the orchard bough
  In England now!

The nest, which is an exceptionally beautiful structure, takes about a
fortnight to build. Closely woven, it appears to consist mainly of wool,
into which moss and lichens of various colours are deftly woven. The
outside is cunningly decorated with bits of lichen and the inner bark of
trees, such as the birch, the whole being secured by a thin veil of
spiders' webs. The lichen and bark serve to render the nest inconspicuous
by blending it with the general appearance of the bush or small tree in a
forked bough of which it is placed. Inside the wool is more closely felted
even than on the outside, and this is covered with fine hairs, amongst
which a few feathers are intermixed. The work of building seems to be done
by the female only, though the male helps by bringing the materials.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

BULLFINCH.

Black varieties are occasionally taken in a wild state. Caged specimens fed
on hemp-seed frequently turn black.]

Of the GOLDFINCH, LINNETS, and BULLFINCH, by far the most popular and
beautiful is the GOLDFINCH, which is, and probably will long remain, one of
the most prized of cage-birds. Gifted "with the fatal gift of beauty," this
bird is much persecuted by bird-catchers; and indeed, partly owing to the
depredations of these men, and partly to improved methods of agriculture,
which have diminished its feeding-area, this handsome bird is growing more
and more rare every year.

Next to the goldfinch perhaps the LINNET is most sought after as a
cage-bird. Large numbers are taken during the autumn, when the birds
congregate in large flocks before departure on migration. Those captured in
the spring are said to be very impatient of confinement, and only a small
percentage seem to survive.

The linnet is one of the most variable of birds in the matter of plumage,
and for a long while the opinion was generally held, especially by
bird-catchers, that several distinct species--the RED, BROWN, and GREY
LINNETS--existed. It is now known that these are all phases of plumage
common to one species. In the male in full summer dress the forehead and
centre of the crown are blood-red, whilst the breast is of a glossy
rose-red; but these bright colours do not seem to be acquired so
universally as is the case with other birds which don a special
breeding-dress, nor are they ever developed in captivity. Occasionally what
are called LEMON-BREASTED varieties of the linnet occur in which the
rose-colour of the breast is replaced by yellow.

The BULLFINCH, though one of the common British birds, is by no means so
abundant as the two foregoing species; for whilst the other two travel in
small flocks, the bullfinch is a solitary bird. Few birds perhaps have
earned a more evil name than the bullfinch, which is accused by the
gardener of inflicting enormous damage on the flower-buds of fruit-trees in
winter and spring. "On the other hand," writes Mr. Hudson, "he is greatly
esteemed as a cage-bird, and the bird-catchers are ever on the watch for
it. But the effect in both cases is pretty much the same, since the hatred
that slays and the love that makes captive are equally disastrous to the
species." That it is diminishing in many districts there can be no doubt,
and perhaps its final extermination is only a matter of time. Though by no
means a remarkable songster in a wild state, in captivity it is capable of
learning to whistle strains and airs of human composition with some skill,
good performers fetching high prices.

The SPARROW and the wild CANARY of Madeira--from the latter of which our
cage-pets have been derived--are also members of the Finch Tribe, but are
too well known to need fuller mention.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

GREENFINCH.

Commonly known as the Green Linnet.]

Closely allied to the Finches are the BUNTINGS, which are really only
slightly modified finches. Several species are British birds, one of the
commonest being the CORN-BUNTING, a bird which bears a wonderful
resemblance to a skylark, from which, however, it may be distinguished by
its large beak and small claw on the hind toe.

The YELLOWAMMER, or YELLOWHAMMER, is another familiar roadside form in
England, which scarcely needs description.

The most celebrated of all the buntings is the ORTOLAN, or GREEN-HEADED
BUNTING, a bird resembling its congener the yellowhammer, but lacking its
bright coloration. It has acquired fame from the delicate flavour of its
flesh, and to supply the demand for this delicacy immense numbers are
netted annually by the bird-catchers of the Continent. Wintering in North
Africa, these birds leave Europe in September in large flocks, and it is
during this migration and the return journey in the spring that their ranks
are so mercilessly thinned. Common over the greater part of Europe, it is
somewhat surprising that the ortolan does not occur more frequently in the
British Islands, where it is only an occasional spring and autumn visitor.

The SNOW-BUNTING, or SNOWFLAKE, is a regular winter visitant to the British
Islands, some pairs indeed remaining to breed in the Highlands of Scotland
every year, whilst its presence serves to enliven some of the dreariest
spots of high northern latitudes. The male in breeding-dress is a handsome
bird, having the upper-parts black and the under white; its mate is
somewhat duller, the black parts being obscured by greyish white, fulvous,
and blackish brown, whilst the white parts are less pure in tone. The full
dress of the male is rarely seen in the British Islands, save in specimens
procured from Scotland; for in winter, when the snow-bunting is chiefly
captured, the plumage is altogether more rufous.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

LINNET.

One of the most popular cage-birds. The so-called Red-brown and Grey
Linnets are but phases of plumage of the same species. The bird in the
right-hand corner is a greenfinch.]

Unlike the buntings so far described, the REED-BUNTING is to be found only
in marshy places, but in suitable localities it may be found in the British
Islands all the year round, being as common a species as the corn-bunting,
and therefore not calling for special description here.

The eggs of the buntings are remarkable for the curious scribble-like
markings which cover them, and serve readily to distinguish them from those
of any other British bird.

CHAPTER XVI.

_LARKS, TITMICE, HONEY-EATERS, AND THEIR KINDRED._


Confined almost entirely to the Old World, where they are represented by
more than one hundred species, many of which have undergone considerable
specialisation in the matter of plumage, so as to enable them to live in
desert regions, the LARKS constitute a well-marked group, into the
characters of which we need not enter here.

The best-known member of the group is the SKYLARK. Common throughout the
British Islands, and of sober coloration, no bird is more universally
beloved, and this largely on account of the sweetness of its song, which is
second only to that of the nightingale. Poets and prose-writers alike have
sounded its praises, many in passages that will be remembered as long as
our language lasts. The skylark is one of the few birds which sing while on
the wing; the peculiar nature of the flight at this time all must have
watched, entranced the while by the beauty of the song.

Grahame, in his "Birds of Scotland," happily describes the nest as
follows:--

  The daisied lea he loves, where tufts of grass
  Luxuriant crown the ridge; there, with his mate,
  He founds their lowly house, of withered bents,
  And coarsest speargrass; next, the inner work
  With finer and still finer fibres lays,
  Rounding it curious with its speckled breast.

This bird displays great affection for its young, removing them under the
fear of impending danger, or if the nest is meddled with. Occasionally,
however, the bird sits close, instead of seeking safety by flight.

Brighton enjoys the credit of consuming more larks than any other place in
England, except London. It has been estimated that the number of larks
annually entering the metropolitan markets alone reaches a total of
400,000--20,000 or 30,000 being often sent together; and the numbers eaten
elsewhere in the country must be enormous, quite as large, indeed, as
abroad. Most are captured from the hosts which arrive on the east coast of
Scotland and England from the Continent on approach of severe weather, the
birds making their appearance in thousands, forming a constant and unbroken
stream for two or three days in succession.

Close allies of the Larks, the WAGTAILS and PIPITS come next under
consideration. The former range over the Old World, but are unknown in
Australia and Polynesia. The pipits have a similar range, but one species
is found in, and is peculiar to, Australia. Like wagtails, pipits are
unknown in Polynesia; only two species occur in America.

The WAGTAILS are generally black and white, grey and white, grey with
yellow breasts, or yellowish green with yellow breasts. In the
last-mentioned case, as in some specimens of the YELLOW WAGTAIL, the yellow
predominates. These birds frequent streams and stagnant waters, like the
RED and GREY WAGTAILS; or corn-fields and meadows, as in the case of the
YELLOW WAGTAIL. All these are commonly met with in the British Islands.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

SKYLARKS.

The numbers of skylarks seem to increase with the spread of agricultural
improvement.]

The PIPITS are duller-coloured than the Wagtails, have shorter tails, and
evince less fondness for the water. The MEADOW-, ROCK-, and TREE-PIPITS are
the commonest British species.

Neither Wagtails nor Pipits are much given to perching, but the
TREE-CREEPERS spend their lives upon trees, some being specially modified
for this mode of life, their tail-feathers being stiff and terminating in
sharp points. By pressing its tail closely against the tree-trunk up which
it is climbing, the bird obtains a wonderfully reliable support. Beginning
at the bottom of a trunk, creepers quickly work their way up in a spiral
direction, or sometimes in jerky zigzags, searching every crevice for tiny
insects, their eggs and larvæ, and flitting from the higher branches, when
these are reached, to the base of another tree.

Creepers are mostly dull-coloured, but the WALL-CREEPER has crimson patches
on the wings. This bird, which has occurred in Britain, haunts
mountain-cliffs. The TREE-CREEPER, a resident in Britain, builds its nest
behind pieces of loose bark, or under tiles, or in crevices of trees,
walls, or hollow branches. In this nest are laid from six to nine eggs,
pure white, spotted with red, or with a creamy ground-colour, with the
spots thicker round the large end.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Radland & Sons._

YOUNG SKYLARKS.

Several broods are reared by each pair of birds in a season.]

Intermediate in position between the Creepers and the Titmice are the
NUTHATCHES. Chiefly inhabitants of the northern parts of both hemispheres,
they extend as far south as Mexico, whilst in the Old World they occur
plentifully in the Himalaya. The largest species is found in the mountains
of Burma. One species is frequently met with in England, and occasionally
in Scotland, but is unknown in Ireland.

The ENGLISH NUTHATCH may serve us as a type of the group. "Its habits,"
writes Dr. Sharpe, "are a combination of those of the tit and woodpecker.
Like the former bird, the nuthatch seeks diligently for its insect-food on
the trunks and branches of trees, over which it runs like a woodpecker,
with this difference, that its tail is not pressed into the service of
climbing a tree, nor does it generally ascend from the bottom to the top,
as a woodpecker so often does. On the contrary, a nuthatch will generally
be found in the higher branches, and will work its way down from one of the
branches towards the trunk, and is just as much at home on the under side
of a limb as the upper. Its movements are like those of a mouse rather than
of a bird, and it often runs head-downward, or hangs on the under side of a
branch and hammers away at the bark with its powerful little bill. The
noise produced by one of these birds, when tapping at a tree, is really
astonishing for a bird of its size, and, if undisturbed, it can be
approached pretty closely. Its general food consists of insects, and in the
winter the nuthatches join the wandering parties of tits and creepers which
traverse the woods in search of food.... In the autumn it feeds on
hazel-nuts and beech-mast, breaking them open by constant hammering; and,
like the tits, the nuthatches can be tempted to the vicinity of houses in
winter, and become quite interesting by their tameness."

The nuthatch nests in hollow trees, plastering up the entrance with mud,
and leaving an aperture only just sufficient to enable it to wriggle in and
out. A remarkable nest may be seen at the British Natural History Museum.
It was built in the side of a haystack, to which the industrious birds had
carried as much as 11 lbs. of clay, and had thus made for themselves a
solid nest in an apparently unfavourable position.

The TITMICE occur in one form or another all over Europe, Asia, and Africa,
and in the New World as far south as Southern Mexico. The family may be
divided into TRUE, CRESTED, LONG-TAILED, and PENDULINE TITS and REEDLINGS,
all but the penduline tits being represented in England.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

NUTHATCH.

Apparently unknown in a wild state in Ireland, and rare in Scotland, in
England fairly common.]

Of the true tits, the best known is the BLUE TIT, which is no stranger even
in London parks. Travelling in small bands throughout the autumn and
winter, they may frequently be met with during a country walk, their
presence being made known by a pretty tinkling little note. This method of
travelling is obviously advantageous, for the discovery of food at this
time is an arduous task, and, if undertaken individually, many would surely
starve, as Professor Newton points out: "A single titmouse searching alone
might hunt for a whole day without meeting with a sufficiency, whilst, if a
dozen are united by the same motive, it is hardly possible for the place in
which the food is lodged to escape their detection, and, when discovered, a
few call-notes from the lucky finder are enough to assemble the whole
company to share the feast.... One tree after another is visited by the
active little rovers, and its branches examined: if nothing be forthcoming,
away goes the explorer to the next that presents itself, merely giving
utterance to the usual twitter that serves to keep the whole body together.
But if the object of search be found, another chirp is emitted, and the
next moment several members of the band are flitting in succession to the
tree, and eagerly engaged with the spoil."

These little birds display great affection for their old nesting-places. An
instance is on record where, so far back as 1785, a pair built their nest
in a large earthenware bottle placed in the branches of a tree in a garden
at Oxbridge, near Stockton-on-Tees. With two exceptions only, this bottle
was tenanted by a pair of these birds every year till 1873. In 1892
Professor Newton, who had this account from Canon Tristram, was informed
that the occupancy had ceased for four years.

The LONG-TAILED or BOTTLE-TIT is a British species, deriving its name from
the long tail. It is a pretty little bird, black and rose-colour above,
with a rose-coloured abdomen, and the head, throat, and breast white. It
enjoys the distinction of being one of the smallest British birds, and is
found in woods and plantations all over England, though less common in
Scotland. These tits have a curious habit of roosting during the winter,
six or seven huddling together in a row, with three or four others perched
on their backs, and two or three on the top.

The nest, which is placed in a tree or bush, is a model of industry. Oval
in shape, and roofed, with a small aperture near the top, it is composed of
moss, lichen, and hair, closely felted and lined with an enormous
collection of feathers, Macgillivray having counted 2,779 in a single nest.

Other species of titmice occurring in Britain are the GREAT, MARSH-, COAL-,
and CRESTED TITS.

Whether the REEDLINGS, or BEARDED TITS, as they are generally called, are
really true titmice or peculiarly modified buntings is a moot-point. There
is but one species, which is British, though found also on the Continent;
but it is unfortunately becoming more and more rare every year. The general
colour of the upper-parts is cinnamon-rufous, except the head, which is
pearly grey: between the bill and the eyes hangs a tuft of long black
feathers; hence the name Bearded Tit. The under-parts are white, tinged
with yellow and pink, whilst the wings are variegated with white, black,
and red. This tit lives in beds of reeds fringing the "broads" of the
eastern counties of England, though even there it is now exceedingly rare.

The same uncertainty that obtains with regard to the position of the
Reedlings confronts the ornithologist with regard to the affinities of the
liliputian GOLD-CRESTS. About six species are known, from the northern and
temperate parts of the Old and New Worlds, extending as far south in the
latter as Mexico. Two occur in Britain: one, known simply as the
GOLD-CREST, or GOLDEN-CRESTED WREN, is fairly common; the other, the
FIRE-CREST, or FIRE-CRESTED WREN, is much rarer, but differs very little
from its relative in general appearance.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

MARSH-TIT SEARCHING FOR INSECTS.

The marsh-tit may be distinguished from its ally, the coal-tit, by the
absence of white on the nape of the neck.]

The GOLD-CREST is olive-green above, yellowish grey below, with a
conspicuous crest of bright yellow and orange, banded on each side by two
black lines. It has the distinction of being the smallest British bird; and
it is partly on account of its smallness, and partly owing to its shy,
retiring habits, seeking concealment among the foliage, that it is so
seldom seen, save by those who know where to look for it; and these may
find it all the year round in suitable places.

In the spring this bird may be observed suspended in the air for a
considerable time over a bush or flower, singing very melodiously, though
few naturalists have ever witnessed this display. Mr. W. H. Hudson, one of
these few, writes: "I have observed the male, in the love-season, hovering
just above the bush, in the topmost foliage of which its mate was perched
and partly hidden from view. It is when engaged in this pretty aerial
performance, or love-dance, that the golden-crested wren is seen at his
best. The restless, minute, sober-coloured creature, so difficult to see
properly at other times, then becomes a conspicuous and exceedingly
beautiful object; it hovers on rapidly vibrating wings, the body in an
almost vertical position, but the head bent sharply down, the eyes being
fixed on the bird beneath, while the wide-open crest shines in the sun like
a crown or shield of fiery yellow. When thus hovering, it does not sing,
but emits a series of sharp, excited chirping sounds."

The nest is a singularly beautiful structure, made of fine, dry grass,
leaves, moss, and spiders' webs, woven closely together, lined with
feathers, and suspended like a hammock beneath a branch of yew or fir. In
this are laid from six to ten eggs of a pale yellowish white, spotted and
blotched with reddish brown.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

GREAT TIT.

Known also as the Ox-eye; it is very pugnacious in captivity, killing birds
even as large as itself.]

The numbers of British gold-crests are vastly increased by the arrival on
the eastern coast of gold-crests from the Continent. "In autumn," writes
Mr. Howard Saunders, "immense flocks sometimes arrive on our east coast,
extending quite across England and the Irish Channel, and into Ireland. In
1882 the migration wave of this description, commencing on August 6 and
lasting for ninety-two days, reached from the Channel to the Færoes; in
1883 the migration lasted eighty-two days; and again in 1884 for a period
of eighty-seven days.... On such occasions bushes in gardens on the coast
are covered with birds as with a swarm of bees; crowds flutter round the
lanterns of lighthouses, and the rigging of fishing-smacks in the North Sea
is thronged with weary travellers. In April a return migration occurs."

We pass now to the consideration of a few families of birds unknown in
Britain, but interesting on account of the fact that they afford us another
set of instances of adaptation to attain particular ends, so frequently to
be met with in Nature. All the birds in question, though probably not
related, have peculiarly modified tongues, apparently specially designed to
aid in sucking up honey from flowers.

The first group for consideration are the HONEY-EATERS of New Zealand and
Australia. So great is the transformation which the tongue in these birds
has undergone, that it forms one of the most elaborate organs of its kind,
surpassing even that of the Humming-birds. A description of this organ
without the aid of anatomical terms and diagrams would be useless. Suffice
it to say it is long, capable of being thrust out of the mouth, and
brush-like. It is used to thrust up the tubes of honey-bearing flowers, as
well for the sake of the juice as for the insects gathered in such
situations to feed on it.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishhaw, N.B._

COAL-TITS.

These birds show the white patch on the nape very distinctly. It is a
common British bird, staying with us the whole year round.]

The best known of the Honey-eaters is the POE, or PARSONBIRD, of New
Zealand. Glossy black in colour, with vivid green and blue reflections, it
is rendered still more attractive by a pair of white tufts of feathers
hanging from the front upper part of the neck, whilst on the back of the
neck in the same region the feathers are of a loose structure, long, and
curled forwards. Other honey-eaters are the WHITE-EYES, SUN-BIRDS, and
FLOWER-PECKERS.

The WHITE-EYES, so called from a ring of white feathers around the eye,
have a wide distribution, being found in Australia, India, Africa,
Madagascar, and Japan. Besides honey they are very partial to fruit,
particularly figs and grapes, and also capture insects on the wing, after
the fashion of fly-catchers.

The SUN-BIRDS correspond in the Old World to the Humming-birds in the New,
having, like the latter, a metallic plumage, varied in its hues and
wondrous in its beauty; but they are not entirely dependent upon this
lustre for their charm, for much of their splendour is gained from the
non-metallic portion of the plumage, which is often vividly coloured. The
females are dull-coloured, whilst the males lose their beauty in the winter
season. These birds are inhabitants of the tropical regions of Africa,
India, and Australia, and seem to revel in the burning rays of the noonday
sun.

Nearly allied to the Sun-birds are the FLOWER-PECKERS of the Indian and
Australian regions. These are all small birds, remarkable as much for the
beauty of their nests as for the splendour of their plumage. The nests are
purse-like structures, made of white cotton-like material, and suspended
from a branch instead of, as usual, resting on it. One of the most
beautiful birds of the whole group, which includes numerous species, is the
Australian DIAMOND-BIRD. Of a general ashy-grey colour, this species is
splashed all over with spots of red, yellow, orange, and black, whilst the
tail-coverts are rich dark red.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard_

RED-BACKED SHRIKES.

Also called Butcher-birds, from their habit of killing small birds and
mammals and hanging them up on thorns.]

CHAPTER XVII.

_SHRIKES, THRUSHES AND THEIR ALLIES, SWALLOWS, LYRE-BIRDS, CHATTERERS,
BROAD-BILLS, ETC._

The Shrike Family are an exceedingly interesting group of birds, of
world-wide distribution and of great diversity of appearance, varying in
size from a bird as small as a titmouse to one as large as a thrush, and
presenting a considerable range of coloration, some being very brightly,
others dull coloured. From the hooked beak, and the presence of a notch in
the tip of the upper jaw, they were considered by the older naturalists to
be allies of the Birds of Prey, a decision still further supported by their
hawk-like habit of capturing living prey in the shape of small birds and
mice; whilst the remarkable custom of impaling their victims, still living,
on thorns has earned for them the popular name of BUTCHER-BIRDS. The limits
of the family, owing to the diversity of the forms involved, have not as
yet been finally determined by naturalists, some having included species
which others hold have no place there.

[Illustration: Photo by W. Reid]     [Wishaw, N.B.

AUSTRALIAN MAGPIE.

A common South Australian form, known also as the Piping-crow.]

Five species are commonly included in the list of British birds, although
only two occur with any frequency: of these, the GREAT GREY SHRIKE visits
Great Britain every winter; whilst the smaller RED-BACKED SHRIKE is an
annual summer visitor to those islands, breeding, however, only in England,
occurring but occasionally in Scotland, and being almost unknown in
Ireland, where only one specimen has ever been recorded.

The RED-BACKED SHRIKE, writes Dr. Sharpe, "reminds us of a fly-catcher in
the way in which [it] captures its food, for it has undoubtedly favourite
perches, on which it sits, and to which it returns after the capture of an
insect. It is frequently to be seen on telegraph-wires, where it keeps a
sharp look-out in every direction, and a favourite resort is a field of
freshly cut grass. It also captures a good many mice and small birds, not
pursuing them in the open like birds of prey, but dropping down on them
suddenly. In the British Museum is a very good specimen of the larder of a
red-backed shrike, taken with the nest of the bird by Lord Walsingham in
Norfolk, and showing the way in which the shrike spits insects and birds on
thorns; and the species has been known ... to hang up birds even bigger
than itself, such as blackbirds and thrushes, as well as tits of several
kinds, robins, and hedge-sparrows, while it will also occasionally seize
young partridges and pheasants."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

REED-WARBLER.

A common British bird, arriving in April, and leaving again in September.]

Though undeniably unmusical, the red-backed shrike is nevertheless able to
imitate with considerable success the notes of other small birds, decoying
them by this means within striking distance--an accomplishment shared also
by other members of the Shrike Family. The present species is attractively
clothed in a plumage varied with black, grey, rufous, and chestnut-brown,
the last being the predominating hue of the upper-parts; hence the name
Red-backed Shrike.

The habits of its congener, the GREAT GREY SHRIKE, are precisely similar. A
caged specimen which had become very tame would take food from its captor's
hands. When a bird was given it, the skull was invariably broken at once,
after which, holding the body in its claws, the shrike would proceed to
tear it in pieces after the fashion of a hawk. Sometimes, instead, the
carcase would be forced through the bars of the cage--in lieu of
thorns--and then pulled in pieces.

Very different in appearance from the members of the Shrike Family are a
group of possibly allied forms known as WAX-WINGS. Of pleasing but sober
coloration, they are remarkable for certain curious appendages to the inner
quill-feathers, of a bright sealing-wax red colour, from which they derive
their name: similar wax-like appendages occur also, sometimes, on the
tail-feathers.

Breeding in the Arctic Circle, wax-wings occur in both the Old and New
Worlds, though some species peculiar to the latter region lack the wax-like
appendages characteristic of the majority of the species. These birds are
erratic in their movements, and large bands occasionally visit the British
Islands during the autumn and winter, the eastern counties being usually
the most favoured spots; but on the occasion of one of these immigrations,
in the winter of 1872, many were seen in the neighbourhood of the North of
London. During the summer they feed on insects, but in autumn and winter on
berries and fruit. At this time they become very fat and are then captured
and sold in large numbers for food in the Russian markets, and occasionally
are sent over to London.

A resident British species, sometimes called the Mavis.]

YOUNG THRUSH.

This photograph shows the mud-lined nest.]

Passing over a small group of comparatively uninteresting American birds
known as "Greenlets," we come to the WARBLERS, a group which constitutes
one of the largest families of birds of the Old World. The species included
in this family vary greatly in their characters, so that it is by no means
easy to give diagnostic characters, whereby they may be readily
distinguished from the Fly-catchers on the one hand or the Thrushes on the
other. The Thrushes, however, as a group, may be distinguished from the
Warblers by the circumstance that in the former the young have a
distinctive spotted plumage, differing from that of the adults, while the
young of the Warblers are not so marked, their plumage differing but little
from that of their parents.

More than twenty species of warblers are included amongst British birds.
Although some of them are but rare and accidental visitors to Britain,
others are amongst the commonest of the spring migrants, remaining to nest,
and leaving again in the autumn. Some, as the BLACK-CAP, WHITE-THROAT,
CHIFF-CHAFF, GARDEN-, WILLOW-, and WOOD-WARBLERS, frequent woods,
hedgerows, and gardens; whilst others, as the SEDGE- and REED-WARBLERS, are
found only near water affording sufficient shelter in the shape of
reed-banks or osier-plantations.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

BLACKBIRD.

The male and female are quite different one from another, and in this
respect differ from the Thrushes, in which the sexes are alike.]

The BLACK-CAP and GARDEN-WARBLER rank as songsters of no mean talent, being
held second only to the nightingale. As if by common consent, the two
former never clash, so that where black-caps are common there are few
garden-warblers, and _vice versâ_.

Most of these birds build a typical cup-shaped nest of dried grasses, lined
with finer materials, and placed near the ground; but that of the
REED-WARBLER is a most beautiful structure, the dried grass of which it is
made being woven around some three or four reed-stems, making it seem as if
the latter had, in growing up, pierced the sides of the nest in their
course. The cup-shaped hollow is very deep, so that when the supporting
reeds are bowed low in the breeze the eggs rest perfectly safe.

We must pass now to a consideration of the Thrush Tribe, which, as we have
already hinted, are very closely allied to the Warblers.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott, Leighton Buzzard._

ROBIN.

The young Robin wears a distinct livery, quite different from that of its
parents.]

Birds like the COMMON THRUSH and the BLACKBIRD are so common and so well
known that they scarcely need comment here. The same perhaps is true of
many other members of this group not popularly associated with the Thrush
Tribe; such are the RED-BREAST, or ROBIN RED-BREAST, as it is more
generally called, and the NIGHTINGALE. Few birds have inspired so many
writers as the nightingale; it even holds a place in classical mythology.
Professor Newton gives us one variant of a very common but pretty story:
"Procne and Philomela were the daughters of Pandion, King of Attica, who in
return for warlike aid rendered him by Tereus, King of Daulis in Thrace,
gave him the first-named in marriage. Tereus, however, being enamoured of
her sister, feigned that his wife was dead, and induced Philomela to take
her place. On her discovering the truth, he cut out her tongue to hinder
her from revealing his deceit; but she depicted her sad story on a robe
which she sent to Procne, and the two sisters then contrived a horrible
revenge for the infidelity of Tereus by killing and serving to him at table
his son Itys. Thereupon the gods interposed, changing Tereus into a hoopoe,
Procne into a swallow, and Philomela into a nightingale, while Itys was
restored to life as a pheasant, and Pandion (who had died of grief at his
daughters' dishonour) as a bird of prey [the osprey]."

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

NIGHTINGALE.

The sweetest and most renowned of all the British songsters.]

A not infrequent error with regard to the red-breast may be pointed out
here. Many people seem to suppose that the female is less brilliantly
coloured than her mate. As a matter of fact this is not so; what are
generally regarded as females of this species are the dull, spotted young,
which, as we have already pointed out, assume this peculiar livery
throughout the tribe.

No less common in Britain, during the summer months at least, are the
WHEAT-EARS, STONE-CHATS, WHIN-CHATS, and RED-STARTS. Small and prettily
coloured species, these are all insect-eaters, and, with the exception of
the wheat-ears, lay blue eggs, deposited in somewhat coarsely constructed
nests, placed on or near the ground; or in holes in ruins, trees, or walls,
in the case of the red-starts; or in burrows or under ledges of rock, as
among the wheat-ears, which lay white eggs.

The bird commonly known as the HEDGE-SPARROW is a close ally of the Thrush
Family, having nothing to do with the sparrows proper--which are
finches--as its name would imply.

STONE-CHAT.

A resident and generally distributed British bird.]

Another nearly related form is the DIPPER, or WATER-OUZEL. By no means
brilliantly coloured, it is nevertheless an exceedingly interesting bird,
and one never met with away from mountain streams. The group has a wide
distribution, occurring in suitable localities in Europe, Asia, and the
Rocky Mountains of America, and extending from Colombia to Peru and
Tucuman. Squat in form, with rounded wings and short tail, the ouzel seeks
the greater part of its food on the bottom of swiftly running streams. It
is everywhere, writes Dr. Sharpe of the commoner of the two British
species, a shy and watchful bird, and, except in the breeding-season,
appears to be solitary. By patient watching near the dipper's haunts,
however, it is possible to observe the bird scudding over the surface of
the water with a rapid flight and a vigorous beating of the wings,
something like that of a kingfisher, until it alights on a rock or large
stone in the middle of the stream. Its white breast then stands out in bold
relief, and, after pausing for a moment, the bird commences to edge to the
side of the rock, and either walks deliberately into the water, or
disappears suddenly beneath the surface, seeking its food at the bottom of
the stream, in the shape of larvæ, caddis-worms, water-beetles, and small
snails.

The WRENS are probably near allies of the Dippers. The family includes a
number of species of small birds, most largely represented in the New
World, but distributed widely over the Old World also. Two occur in the
British Islands: of these, one, the COMMON WREN, is found throughout
Europe, and occurs also in Northern Africa, Asia Minor, and North
Palestine; whilst the other, the ST. KILDA WREN, is only found on the
island from which it takes its name.

Considerations of space compel us to pass over three or four families, of
comparatively little interest to any save the scientific ornithologist, in
favour of the FLY-CATCHERS and SWALLOWS.

The former, in that the young are spotted, appear to evince some affinity
to the Thrush Tribe, but they have broad and flatter bills than the latter,
whilst the mouth is surrounded by more or less conspicuous bristles. They
are entirely Old World forms, having their stronghold in Africa.

Three species of fly-catcher occur in England, though only one, the COMMON
or SPOTTED FLY-CATCHER, usually breeds in Great Britain, coming late in the
spring from Africa. As its name implies, it feeds upon small insects,
capturing them on the wing by sudden sallies, and returning immediately
after to some perch, generally a garden-fence, or the bare bough of a tree.
As a rule the prey is caught with a sudden dart, but sometimes only after a
prolonged flight, when the bird will double and turn, as the necessity
arises, with great skill. Its nest, made of dry grass and moss, lined with
horse-hair and covered externally with spider-webs and lichens, is usually
placed in some sheltered position, such as a crevice in the bark of a tree
or in the creepers covering the trellis-work of a house; and owing to the
skilful way in which it is covered externally, so as to resemble its
surroundings, is difficult to find.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. T. Newman_]     [_Berkhamsted._

A PAIR OF WRENS.

Known nearly everywhere in England as the "Kitty" or "Jenny" Wren.]

The SWALLOWS and MARTINS constitute an exceedingly well-defined group of
birds, and one which holds a conspicuously high place in the regard of
mankind, finding a welcome everywhere on account of the great benefits they
confer by the removal of insect-pests in the shape of the smaller gnats and
flies. These, were they not kept in check by the Swallow Tribe, would
render most parts of the world uninhabitable. Rarely seen upon the ground,
save when procuring mud for the construction of their nests, the birds of
this group are all peculiarly strong fliers, turning and twisting with the
greatest speed and precision. All have very short beaks and wide mouths,
long wings and tails, and small and weak feet.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

COMMON WRENS, WITH NEST BUILT IN PHEASANT'S SKELETON.

In winter wrens have a custom of seeking some hole or other convenient
shelter and huddling together in small parties for the sake of warmth.]

A large number build their nests of mud, collected in small pellets and
held together by the secretion of the salivary glands. These nests are
commonly more or less cup-shaped, and fastened under the eaves of
dwelling-houses or other buildings, or placed on a convenient beam or other
ledge. The RED-RUMPED SWALLOWS and FAIRY MARTINS--species enjoying an
enormous distribution, being found in India, Africa, America, and
Australia--build very large flask-shaped nests, having the entrance
produced into a funnel often eight or nine inches in length. Others, like
the SAND-MARTIN, excavate long tunnels, terminating in larger chambers, in
the faces of sand-banks--a performance which must certainly be regarded as
wonderful, when one realises the feeble tools with which the task of
excavating has to be performed. Some species utilise the holes made by
other birds, in one species this hole being itself bored within the burrow
of the viscacha.

All are more or less migratory in their habits, some covering enormous
distances in journeying to and fro between their winter retreats and their
summer breeding-places. The COMMON SWALLOW and HOUSE-MARTIN, for example,
leave the shores of Africa early in the spring, and distribute themselves
over Europe, thousands visiting the British Islands. After rearing in their
respective breeding-places from two to three broods, they return with their
offspring before the rigours of winter set in to the African Continent. The
routes and destinations of the swallow are now well known; but as much
cannot be said for the house-martin, whose winter quarters are as yet
enshrouded in mystery. That they must be somewhere in Africa is all that
can at present be said.

Three species of the Swallow Tribe visit England regularly every year, and
remain to breed. These are the COMMON or CHIMNEY-SWALLOW, and the
HOUSE-MARTIN just referred to, and the little SAND-MARTIN. In the two first
mentioned the upper-parts are of a dark steel-blue colour with a metallic
gloss, but they are, nevertheless, easily distinguished one from
another,--since the swallow has a deeply forked tail, and a bright chestnut
patch on the throat, with a similarly coloured band across the forehead;
whilst the martin lacks the chestnut markings, and is pure white beneath,
with a large white patch on the lower part of the back, and a less markedly
forked tail. Furthermore, the legs of the martin are feathered down to the
claws, whilst the feet of the swallow are bare. The sand-martin is a little
greyish-brown bird, with white under-parts. It is the earliest of the
Swallow Tribe to arrive in Britain, and the first to depart.

YOUNG SWALLOWS.

For hundreds of years it has been regarded as most unlucky to kill a
swallow.]


LYRE-BIRDS AND SCRUB-BIRDS.

At the beginning of the account of the Perching-birds it was stated that
the group was divided into two sections, and that each of these was further
sub-divided into two. With the Swallows the first sub-division of the first
section ended; the second we are to consider now in the very singular
LYRE-BIRDS and SCRUB-BIRDS of Australia.

Rendered conspicuous on account of the remarkable lyrate tail, from which
the name is derived, the LYRE-BIRDS, on closer acquaintance, prove to be
exceedingly interesting forms, though materials for a really complete
biography of the three known species are not yet available. The males, it
seems, are skilled mimics, reproducing the songs of other birds with great
fidelity, this being especially true of the species known as PRINCE
ALBERT'S LYRE-BIRD. During the courting-season the males construct
hillocks, to which they resort to display their very beautiful and graceful
tails, elevating them over the head, and drooping the wings after the
fashion of a peacock, accompanying this display with certain spasmodic
pecking and scratching actions. They are solitary birds, more than a pair
never being seen together, and even these are exceedingly difficult to
approach, stratagem always being necessary. But a single egg is laid, which
has the appearance of being smeared with ink; whilst the young bird differs
from that of all other perching-birds in the thickness of its downy
covering and the great length of time in which it remains in the nest. The
nest, made of sticks, moss, and fibres skilfully interwoven, and lined
inside with the leaf of a tree-fern which resembles horse-hair, is a large
domed structure, with a single aperture serving as an entrance.

Lyre-birds are essentially ground-dwellers, feeding upon insects,
especially beetles and snails, and keeping to the wilder regions of the
country.

The SCRUB-BIRD is an extremely interesting form, scientifically. Only the
males are known at the present time, and these are dull-coloured birds of
the size of a thrush. Of the female, eggs, and nest, we as yet know
absolutely nothing.

CHATTERERS, ANT-THRUSHES, BROAD-BILLS, ETC.

The second major division of the Perching-birds embraces a few forms of
considerable interest.

The group of CHATTERERS includes several remarkable forms of very diverse
coloration, many representing the most gorgeous of all South American
birds.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. F. Piggott_]     [_Leighton Buzzard._

SAND-MARTINS.

This photograph shows a portion of a sand bank, pierced with the
tunnel-like nests made by these feeble builders.]

One of the most remarkable is the UMBRELLA-BIRD. This bird is funereal in
appearance, being clothed in a plumage of deep black, with the head
surmounted by a large, drooping, flat-topped crest, resembling in shape the
familiar crest of certain varieties of the canary, whilst from the throat
hangs a long lappet of feathers reaching nearly down to the feet. The
female is duller than her mate, and lacks the peculiar plumes. The
umbrella-bird is a forest-dwelling species, confined to the Upper Amazons,
and dwelling in the tops of the highest trees, where it finds ample
sustenance in wild fruits. But few naturalists have ever seen it in a wild
state.

Equally wonderful are the BELL-BIRDS, so called on account of their note,
which bears an extraordinary resemblance to the sound made by a blacksmith
upon an anvil, though it has often been likened to the tolling of a bell.
Four species are known, in three of which the males have a pure white
plumage, with much naked, vividly coloured skin on the face. One species
has a curious pendulous process hanging from the forehead, thinly covered
with feathers. By some this is said to be capable of erection during
periods of excitement. Like the umbrella-bird, these are forest-dwelling
species.

For brilliancy of plumage amongst the Chatterers, the palm must be given to
the COCKS-OF-THE-ROCK, in the males of which orange-red predominates,
whilst the general effect is heightened by crests and curiously curled and
frayed feathers growing from the lower part of the back. The males indulge
in remarkable love-displays, the performances being held in some open
space, and in the presence of the females. One at a time each male appears
to go through a kind of dance, accompanying his peculiar steps and hops
with much swaying of the head and extending of the wings. When tired, the
performer gives a signal which is understood by his fellows, and retires
from the ring, his place being immediately taken by another.

The nesting habits of the Chatterers vary greatly,--some building nests of
mud and twigs, which they fasten on projections of rock in damp caves;
others simply lining holes in trees with dry grass. Some build a cup-shaped
nest of lichens, others a simple platform of sticks, whilst some of the
THICK-BILLED CHATTERERS hang large nests of leaves, plant-stalks, and wool
from low branches, the entrance to the nest being from a hole in the side.
The eggs vary in number among the different species from two to four, and
in colour may be white, chocolate, pale salmon-coloured, or greenish blue,
and are for the most part spotted.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

VICTORIAN LYRE-BIRD.

Lyre-birds, which are also known to the colonists as "Pheasants," are great
mimics.]

Closely allied to the Cocks-of-the-rock are the MANAKINS, for the most part
small and thick-set birds, and in many instances brilliantly coloured--at
least in the case of the males. Some seventy species are known, all of
which are confined to South America. They must be sought for, as a rule, in
the forests or thick undergrowth of marshy places.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

TAIL OF AUSTRALIAN LYRE-BIRD.

This ornamental tail is worn only by the male.]

The Manakin Family contains several species of considerable interest, on
account of the peculiar modifications which certain of the quill-feathers
of the males have undergone. In some species what are known as the
secondary quill-feathers are peculiarly twisted, and have the shafts much
thickened. With these modified feathers the birds are enabled, probably by
clapping the wings and bringing the thickened feathers violently together,
to make a sharp sound, which has been likened to the crack of a whip. Other
species have the quill-feathers of the hand--the primaries, as they are
called--similarly thickened, and they probably are also used to produce
sounds.

One species is known as the BAILADOR, or DANCER, on account of a very
remarkable habit which the males have of dancing. Two males, choosing some
secluded spot, select a bare twig, and, taking up a position about a foot
and a half apart, alternately jump about two feet in the air, and alight
again on exactly the same spot from which they sprang. With the regularity
of clockwork one bird jumps up the instant the other alights, each bird
performing a musical accompaniment to the tune of
"to-le-do--to-le-do--to-le-do," uttering the syllable "to" as he crouches
to spring, "le" while in the air, and "do" as he alights; and this
performance appears to be kept up till the birds are exhausted.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BELL-BIRD.

So called from its wonderfully clear, bell-like note.]

Some of the manakins are very beautifully coloured. One species, for
example, is black, with a blue mantle and a crimson crest; another, black,
with orange-coloured cheeks and breast and similarly coloured band round
the neck, green rump, and yellow abdomen. The females are generally duller
in coloration.

The ANT-THRUSHES, or PITTAS, are long-legged, short-tailed birds, of
brilliant coloration, having their headquarters in the Malay Archipelago;
but the family is represented in India, Australia, and West Africa.

These birds are very shy and exceedingly difficult to approach. One
species, the large GROUND-THRUSH, is described by Wallace as one of the
most beautiful birds of the East. Velvety black above, relieved by pure
white, the shoulders are azure-blue and the belly a vivid crimson. The nest
recalls, in the plan of its architecture, that of the Oven-birds, being
more or less globular in form, and having a lateral entrance; it is
composed of twigs, roots, bark, moss, leaves, and grass, and is frequently
cemented with earth. The eggs are usually spotted, and have a creamy-white
ground-colour: the spots may be brown, reddish grey, or purplish black.

The curious PLANT-CUTTERS of the temperate regions of South America are
nearly related to the Chatterers, though at one time it was believed they
were allied to the True Finches. Constituting but a small family, the
plant-cutters are remarkable for their strangely serrated beaks, the
cutting-edges of which are armed with a series of fine saw-like teeth. This
beak is used in cutting down plants; and as these birds appear to cut down
a great number in sheer wantonness, they are much disliked in the
neighbourhood of gardens and plantations.

Plant-cutters are not conspicuous for the beauty of their plumage, and have
a harsh and grating voice.

The WOOD-HEWERS constitute a group of over 200 species, all of which are
South American. They are for the most part small and dull-coloured birds,
but nevertheless of considerable interest on account of their nest-building
habits. The most remarkable members of the family in this respect are three
species of OVEN-BIRDS. These construct a massive nest of mud, bearing a
more or less fanciful resemblance to a baker's oven; hence the name
Oven-bird. Roughly globular in shape, its walls are of great thickness, and
to prevent cracking hair and grass-fibres are intermixed with the mud; the
interior is gained through a small hole on one side of the nest, which
leads into a passage terminating in a chamber containing the eggs, which
are laid upon a bed of grass. Strangely enough, the bird seeks the most
exposed situations, placing its nest on branches, in the forks of trees, on
posts, rocks, or house-tops. Another species, known to the Spaniards as the
CASARITA, or LITTLE HOUSE-BUILDER, builds its nest at the bottom of a
narrow cylindrical hole, which is said to extend horizontally underground
for nearly six feet. Other species build nests of sticks and twigs or of
grass, which are divided into chambers after the fashion of the mud nest of
the oven-bird, the inner chamber being lined with wool and feathers.

The variation in the form, habits, and coloration of these birds is very
great, some recalling the Woodpeckers and Tree-creepers, others the
Titmice.

The family of the TYRANT FLY-CATCHERS, though numbering some 400 species,
is less interesting, or rather contains fewer peculiar forms, than the
Manakin Family. The tyrant fly-catchers are American birds, and represent
the fly-catchers of the Old World. One of the best known is the KING-BIRD,
which is renowned rather for its pugnacious disposition than for beauty of
plumage.

The CRESTED TYRANT-BIRD has a curious habit of lining its nest with the
cast-off skins of snakes, a habit which has caused a great deal of
discomfort both to juvenile as well as adult egg-collectors, who,
recognising the skin by the touch, have hurriedly withdrawn the hand, lest
the owner of the cast-off coat should be in the vicinity.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

COCK-OF-THE-ROCK.

The cock-of-the-rock is a South American bird, of gorgeous coloration.]

All the tyrant-birds are active and restless in their habits, and frequent
marshy districts, sitting alone, perched on the dead branches of trees or
bushes, whence they dart forth like the Old World fly-catchers on their
prey. Some species, however, frequent bare plains; others, also
ground-dwellers, associate occasionally in flocks.

Though the prey, which consists chiefly of insects, is, as a rule, captured
on the wing, it is not invariably so. One species, for example, pounces
down on crawling beetles, grasps them in its claws, and eats them on the
ground. Some other species eat mice, young birds, snakes, frogs, fishes,
spiders, and worms, the larger victims being beaten on a branch to kill
them. One or two species will eat seeds and berries.

The nest is often domed, and skilfully felted with moss, lichens, and
spider-webs.

The BROAD-BILLS are the sole representatives of the final sub-division of
the Perching-birds. After the brilliant coloration, the next most striking
feature is the great breadth of the bill. Their range is very limited,
extending from the lower spurs of the Himalaya, through Burma and Siam, to
Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. They seek the seclusion of forests in the
neighbourhood of water, exhibiting great partiality for the banks of rivers
and lakes, and feeding on worms and insects, many of the latter being
captured on the wing.

The nest of the broad-bill is a large and not very neat structure, oval in
shape, with an entrance near the top, which is often protected with an
overhanging roof. It is generally suspended from a low branch or plants
near the water, and made of twigs, roots, and leaves, and lined with finer
materials. From three to five eggs are laid.

With these birds, probably the most primitive of the Perching-birds, this
section ends. Many forms have inevitably been crowded out, whilst others
have been but briefly noticed; nevertheless, all the really important
groups have been more or less completely described, and in the majority of
cases well illustrated.

REPTILES.

CHAPTER I.

_CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS._

The Reptile Class, as defined by modern scientific limitations, includes
among the living animals of the world the several groups of the Crocodiles,
the Tortoises and Turtles, the Tuatera, the Lizards, and the Snakes. In the
popular mind the Frogs and Toads, and the Newts and Salamanders, are often
held to belong to the same main section; but these, as hereafter shown,
claim, as Amphibians, an independent position of equivalent rank and value.
In bygone geological ages the Reptile Class embraced a considerably larger
number of groups; some of the members, such as the extinct Dinosaurs,
comprised titanic monsters from 60 to 80 feet in length. The Crocodiles and
Alligators of the present day are the only living reptiles which in any way
approach the extinct Saurians in their dimensions, or assist us in some
small measure to realise their unwieldy forms and bulk.

The members of the Crocodile Order, which, in addition to the Alligators,
includes also the Caimans and so-called Gavials or Garials, agree with one
another in the more or less ponderous lizard-like shape of their body,
supported on well-developed but short and comparatively weak legs, in their
special adaptation to an amphibious existence, carnivorous habits, and
restriction to tropical and subtropical climates.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

YOUNG NILE CROCODILE.

This species was worshipped with divine honours and mummified after death
by the ancient Egyptians.]

Among the salient characters of the CROCODILE, as the representative of its
tribe, which specially adapt it for its aquatic habits, the long, powerful
tail is strongly compressed and thus fitted for use as an organ of
propulsion, and the feet are more or less webbed. The most striking of its
structural adaptations is, however, associated with the formation of the
creature's skull. The manner in which a crocodile or alligator contrives to
breathe or to save itself from asphyxiation, when opening and shutting its
mouth under water, as it may often be observed to do in the Regent's Park
Menagerie, is a common source of wonderment to the onlooker. This seemingly
difficult feat is compassed by virtue of the posterior nostrils, or
breathing-passages, being set so far back in the skull, and being so
completely cut off from the mouth-cavity by specially developed bones of
the palate, that they have no intercommunication with the mouth. It is this
mechanism which enables a crocodile to seize and hold an animal underneath
the water between its open jaws until it is drowned. Special valves at the
back of the mouth prevent any water running down the creature's throat,
while it is able itself to breathe unrestrainedly by allowing just the tip
of its elongated snout, with the anterior nostril-apertures, to remain
above the water's surface. In many species a conspicuous knob-like bony
excrescence is developed at the extremity of the snout, by which the
nostril-openings are raised turret-wise above the surface of the water. The
eyes also being usually elevated above the level of the creature's head,
the crocodile is able to approach its floating or bank-side prey
practically unperceived, its huge body, limbs, and even the head, with the
exception of the nose and eyes, being totally submerged.

A DEAD CROCODILE.

natives in the background give a good idea of its size--little less than 20
feet long.]

Although capable of moving with great activity in the water, crocodiles and
their allies are usually accounted sluggish and slow movers on the land.
Seen basking in the sun, as is their wont, by the hour together on some
sand-bank, or creeping lazily thereon among their fellows, such a
conclusion is natural. The celerity, however, with which even a huge
25-footer, as witnessed by the writer in the Norman River, North
Queensland, will make tracks for and hurl itself into the water, if
disturbed during its midday siesta by the near impact of a rifle-bullet, is
a revelation. Crocodiles, moreover, as might be inferred from the slit-like
contour of the eye-pupil, as shown by daylight, are to a large extent
nocturnal, displaying their greatest activity, and being in the habit of
travelling long distances along and away from the river-banks in search of
food, or in connection with their migratory or mating instincts, under the
cover of darkness.

[Illustration: _Photo by Mr. W. Rau_]     [_Philadelphia._

A CROCODILE.

Note the massive character of the tail, a weapon wherewith the creature can
disable a horse or an ox, or sweep smaller prey into the water.]

Of all living animals the crocodile and its allies are probably equipped
most efficiently for both defence and aggression. The thick, horny shields,
quadrangular on the back, tail, and under-surface, and adapted in shape and
size to cover the head, limbs, and sides, constitute an almost impenetrable
cuirass. As weapons of offence the formidable array of trenchant teeth,
with which the powerful jaws are armed, have not alone to be reckoned with
by the victim assailed. The crocodile's limbs and claws are relatively
weak, and incapable of aggressive mischief; but in the long, compressed,
muscular tail the reptile possesses a terribly effective weapon, wherewith,
with one swift, unexpected side-stroke, it will sweep a smaller animal into
the water, or deal a blow of sufficient power to fell or disable a man or
bullock. Thus well-nigh invulnerable, and cognisant of its marvellous power
of jaw and tail, a full-grown crocodile will not hesitate to try
conclusions with even such puissant adversaries as the bear, the tiger, and
other large carnivora, when they approach the river's brink to drink. Not
infrequently, too, the crocodile comes off the victor in these contests;
while, as sometimes happens, both of the well-matched foes are found dead
side by side at the water's edge. The dread in which crocodiles are held by
the natives of tropical countries, and the heavy toll they levy upon the
riverside population, and more especially the women-folk in their
accustomed avocations of water-carrying or laundry work, are too familiar
to need dissertation. Hence it is that in every country, excepting those
particular locations where the creature is a subject of misguided
veneration or fetish worship, it may be said that every man's hand is
against them, and the enmity most cordially reciprocated.

All the members of the Crocodile Family propagate by egg-production. The
eggs are relatively small in size, those of the largest species not
exceeding that of a goose in dimensions. In shape they are more or less
symmetrically ovate, and encased with a hard, white shell. In the case of
the crocodile, the female selects a suitable dry sand-bank near the river's
edge, in which it excavates a hole of about 2 feet deep, and, having
deposited from twenty to sixty eggs therein, mounts guard over them,
sleeping on top of the nest by day, until the young are hatched. With the
alligator, the site chosen for the nest is more usually among bushes or
reeds at some distance from the water, and the eggs, which may be laid to
the number of over 100, are covered over with leaves and vegetable débris,
whose decomposition engenders the heat required for their successful
incubation. In both instances the parent jealously guards the nest and
repels all intruders until the eggs are hatched, and ultimately conducts
the young ones to the water, where they soon learn to shift for themselves.
Numbers of them, nevertheless, in their young and weak state, fall victims
to vultures, hawks, ichneumons, and all manner of birds and beasts of prey.
From their birth the little saurians are most vicious and irascible in
disposition, hissing and snapping at or laying hold with bull-dog tenacity
of a finger or other seizable object that may be held towards them. From
their earliest days also they are eminently aggressive and carnivorous.
Contenting themselves at first with flies and other insects, they speedily
extend their attentions to frogs, lizards, fish, or any small animals which
frequent the marshes and river-banks; and finally, with their concurrently
increased appetites and dimensions, requisition such larger prey as sheep,
goats, deer, horses, and, as before mentioned, even the human species, if
they can steal a march on them unawares. Crocodiles are provided with
relatively small gullets, and are necessarily incapable of swallowing any
prey whole which is of large dimensions. Accordingly any big quarry which
is seized and dragged into the river is disposed of piecemeal, the reptile
rending the carcase in fragments with the aid of its terrible teeth and
side-wrenches of its ponderous body.

The specimen referred to in the anecdote on page 550.]

Of crocodiles proper, as distinguished from alligators, there are some
dozen known species. From their last-named near allies they are
distinguished by the entire absence of the supplementary bony armature
which in most alligators underlies the outer horny cuirass on the under
surface of the body. A more essential distinction is associated with the
character of the teeth. The upper and lower teeth of the crocodile
interlock, and the fourth lower canine-like tooth is received into a notch
in the side of the upper jaw, and is consequently more or less visible when
the mouth is closed. In the alligators, on the other hand, this bigger
tusk-like tooth fits into a pit-like excavation in the upper jaw, and is
invisible when the mouth is shut.

The TRUE CROCODILES are found in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia,
Australasia, and Central America. The largest is undoubtedly the estuarine
species, ranging from the eastern shores of India, through the Malay
region, to North and East Australia, New Guinea, and the Fiji Islands. This
wide range is a natural concomitant of their brackish- and salt-water
proclivities. Individuals of the species are, in fact, not infrequently met
with floating on the sea at some considerable distance from the land. An
example of this estuarine species has been recorded which measured no less
than 33 feet, while a length of 20 feet and over is by no means of uncommon
occurrence.

CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS, WITH YOUNG.

Notwithstanding their proverbially irascible dispositions, these reptiles,
of all ages and dimensions, herd together on the most amiable terms.]

The method adopted in Queensland and North Australia for capturing these
destructive monsters is that of a running noose, so attached to a suitably
flexible mangrove-tree growing in the vicinity of its nocturnal runs as to
constitute a gigantic spring-trap. A dead carcase or other suitable bait is
added to lure the animal to its doom. The crocodiles thus caught are alive
and uninjured, and can be dispatched or reserved for menagerie exhibition.
A somewhat amusing incident attended the transport of a "reprieved" captive
by steamship from Cairns to Brisbane, Queensland, a few years since. In the
dead of night, when all but the watch and engineer had retired to rest
(they have to anchor and lay-to at night in the Great Barrier Reef
channels), the saurian managed to free himself from his bonds, and started
on a voyage of discovery around the decks. Arriving at the stoke-hold, he
either incontinently stumbled into it, or descended of malice prepense,
sniffing the chance of a supper or a good joke at the engineer's expense.
Anyway, the engineer was aroused from his peaceful dozings with the
impression that the last day of reckoning had arrived, and, rushing up the
hatchway, awakened the whole ship's strength with his frantic outcries.

The NILE CROCODILE, the most familiar form in European menageries, and once
abundant throughout Egypt to the Nile's delta, has now retired to the upper
reaches of that great river. It never attains to the dimensions of the
estuarine form. By the ancient Egyptians, as is well known, this species
was pampered and worshipped with divine honours while living, and after
death embalmed and preserved in the catacombs.

The teeth of crocodiles, as compared with those of alligators, are much
less uniform in size and character.]

Other noteworthy crocodiles, of which space will allow only of the mention
of their names, are the AMERICAN or ORINOCO CROCODILE, and the LONG-SNOUTED
CROCODILE of West Africa, which distantly approach to the LONG-SNOUTED
GAVIAL or GARIAL of India, in which the snout is elongated in a beak-like
manner, and armed with close rows of long, recurved teeth, specially
adapted for its exclusively fish-eating propensities. Full-grown examples
of the gavial may attain to a length of 20 feet.

The TYPICAL or MISSISSIPPI ALLIGATOR is, as its name denotes, a North
American form, having the modified dental and other structural details
previously referred to, but otherwise in size and its aggressively
destructive habits nearly corresponding with the Oriental crocodile. A
second species of alligator is found in China.

MISSISSIPPI AND CHINESE ALLIGATORS.

The Chinese species, which is the smaller of the two, feeds mainly upon
fish.]

In the tropical South American rivers the place of the alligator is
occupied by the CAIMANS, some of which attain to huge proportions, and are
distinguished from the former by the greater development of the bony
armature of both their back and under-surface, and by certain essential,
but to the lay reader obscure, modifications of the skull. An example of
the GREAT CAIMAN once did duty as a riding-horse to the naturalist
Waterton, as all those familiar with his book of travels will remember.

The habits of the caiman differ somewhat locally. From the main stream of
the Lower Amazon they are in the habit of migrating in the dry season to
the inland pools and flooded forests. In the middle districts of the same
river, where the drought is excessive and protracted, the caimans are
addicted to burying themselves in the mud till the rains return; while in
the upper reaches of the Amazon, where the droughts are not prolonged, the
caimans are perennially present. The eggs of these reptiles are much
esteemed for food by the natives of Dutch Guiana.

CHAPTER II.

_TORTOISES AND TURTLES._

The order of the Chelonians, including the Tortoises, Turtles, and
Terrapins, with their allies, constitutes one of the most distinct and
readily defined groups of the Reptile Class. The more or less complete bony
shell, or carapace, which encases the body, and into which both head and
limbs can in many cases be completely retracted, separates these reptiles
very widely from the other orders. In some respects certain details of the
skull-structure assimilate them to the Crocodiles; but here again there is
an entire absence of the rows of formidable teeth, the upper and lower jaws
being sharply pointed, covered with horn, and thus converted into a
trenchant beak. The two leading groups of the Tortoises and the Turtles are
distinctly separated, by the respective conformation of their limbs, for a
terrestrial or aquatic existence. The Tortoises have normal walking-legs,
with toes and, in most instances, claws, fitting them for walking on the
land or burrowing into the earth. In the True Turtles these limbs take the
form of flattened paddles, and in no instance are more than two of the toes
provided with claws.

The TORTOISES are sub-divided by zoologists into some six or eight
subordinate groups or families, for the most part distinguished by the
respective modifications of their protective shells. This shell in all
tortoises and turtles consists of two essential elements--the upper or back
casing, known as the "carapace," and the under one, or so-called
"plastron," which covers the ventral surface. In some forms these two
elements are completely welded into one another, forming a continuous
box-like shell; in others they are more or less separate; while in yet
another series the lower shell is rudimentary. These distinctions have been
found to constitute a convenient basis for classification.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

ASIATIC TORTOISES.

A tortoise, like a turtle, turned over on its back, represents one of the
most helpless of living animals.]

In the TRUE LAND-TORTOISES, which invite first attention, the upper and
lower shells are completely united in a box-like form, and the neck, bent
in the form of the letter S, can be completely retracted within it. The
limbs are club-shaped, covered with horny scales or tubercles, and adapted
for walking, the toes being unwebbed, and provided with strong claw-like
nails.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

EUROPEAN TORTOISE.

A tortoise's shell, or carapace, constitutes a portable house, wherein the
animal can entirely withdraw for shelter in inclement weather, or when
attacked by enemies.]

Pre-eminent among this typical terrestrial series come the huge GIANT or
ELEPHANT-TORTOISES, formerly abundant, as their fossil remains indicate, in
Southern Europe, India, and North and South America, and now represented
only in the isolated oceanic islands of Aldabra, off Madagascar, the
Seychelles, and the Galapagos groups. Even within historic times they were
very abundant in the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues; but their huge
size and lethargic habits, combined with their esculent qualities, have
brought about their extermination. Those remaining in the islands mentioned
are now so reduced in numbers that there is a possibility of their becoming
extinct at an early date, and this notwithstanding the strenuous endeavours
that are being made to save them. A large percentage of the small residue
of these giant Chelonians have been transported from their island homes and
presented to the London Zoological Gardens, where they are now comfortably
housed.

An instructive idea of the aspect and relative dimensions of these giant
tortoises may be obtained by a reference to page vii of the First Volume,
in which one of these Chelonians is shown to be equal in size and strength
to carrying a human rider. It is recorded that these reptiles were so
abundant in the island of Rodrigues in 1691 that one might count as many as
3,000 of them in a single flock, and walk for over 100 paces upon their
backs. All of these giant tortoises, as obtained from separate island
groups, or islets of the groups, exhibit characteristic differences,
indicating the length of time they have been separated from one another.
The age to which these giant tortoises attain is altogether phenomenal. One
example at Port Louis, Mauritius, originally brought from the Seychelles,
is definitely known to have lived for over 130 years from the date of its
transportation. It is stated to have been of large size when imported; and
as these animals are notoriously slow growers, another couple of centuries
may be safely added to its life-span. The Galapagos Islands down to recent
times have produced the greater number of species of these tortoises, the
carapace of the largest of these not infrequently measuring as much as 4
feet in direct length, and the weight of such an animal being over 400 lbs.

ELEPHANT-TORTOISES FROM THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS.

Several species are shown in this photograph.]

Highly interesting details concerning the Galapagos giant tortoises and
their habits are contained in Darwin's "Voyage of the Beagle." At the time
of that illustrious naturalist's visit they were still very abundant in the
islands. He remarked that they abounded in both the higher and damper and
the lower and arid districts, but gave preference to the former. The old
males were invariably the largest, growing to such a size that they
required six or eight men to lift them, and yielded as much as 200 lbs. of
good, highly nutritious meat. On some of the islands there was no water;
and in these cases, as also when they occurred in the dry and arid
lowlands, they were observed to feed chiefly on the succulent cactuses.
When water was plentiful, the tortoises exhibited a great fondness for it,
drinking large quantities and wallowing in the mud. In the larger islands,
where wells and springs existed in the higher and damper portions, regular
well-beaten paths radiated in every direction, indicating the routes, like
sheep-tracks, regularly followed by the tortoises to and from the
water-holes. It was these tracks which betrayed their presence and led to
their first discovery by the older Spanish navigators. When travelling long
distances to the watering-places, it is recorded that they march night and
day, pursuing the "even tenor of their way" at the rate of sixty yards an
hour--one yard per minute, or four miles per day! During the
breeding-season the larger males indulge in hoarse roarings or bellowings
that can be heard for a considerable distance. The female deposits her eggs
either in the sand, where this is plentiful, covering them up again, or,
where the ground is rocky, drops them indiscriminately in any crevice or
depression encountered. The eggs are white, spherical, and hard-shelled, as
in all tortoises, and somewhat exceed those of a hen in bulk.

The very antithesis of the giant land-tortoises of the Galapagos Islands is
the small and familiar GRECIAN TORTOISE, frequently exposed for sale on
hand-barrows in the London streets, and acquired by the unsophisticated
suburban resident as a quaint but not altogether estimable garden pet. Like
the majority of tortoises, this is a vegetarian, and with epicurean tastes
that will guide it instinctively to select your choicest lettuces and the
gems of your horticultural triumphs for the delectation of its fastidious
appetite. The Grecian tortoise rarely exceeds 5½ inches in length, and is
abundant throughout South-eastern Europe, Sicily, Italy, and the Grecian
Archipelago, extending thence to Syria. In Algeria an almost identical
tortoise occurs which grows to the greater length of 9 inches; while Greece
produces yet a third form, the so-called MARGINED TORTOISE, which attains
the greater length of 11 inches, and is distinguished by the colour of the
carapace usually being black, with a small spot of yellow on each
shield-like plate. All three of the foregoing species are collectively
imported by shiploads for sale in England, and it would be interesting to
know what fate befalls them. In Greece and Sicily they are regularly placed
on the market as an article of food. When acclimatised in England, and even
in their warmer native country, these Grecian tortoises bury themselves in
the earth and hibernate during the cold winter months.

ELEPHANT-TORTOISE.

Note the small size of the head with relation to the huge carapace.]

Next to the typical Land-tortoises the so-called HINGED TORTOISES demand
brief notice. The several members of this little group are denizens of
tropical Africa, and notable for the circumstance that the hinder portion
of their carapace is united with the anterior one by a movable ligamentous
hinge. As a result of this peculiarity the animal, when retracted within
its shell, can entirely close up the hinder aperture. None of these forms
exceed a length of 9 inches.

In another group, distinguished by the title of BOX-TORTOISES, a
ligamentous hinge is developed across the centre of the lower shell, or
plastron, which, being freely movable with relation to the upper shell,
enables the animal, when retracted, to completely close up both the
anterior and posterior carapace apertures. The box-tortoises are natives of
the South-eastern United States and Mexico, and, in addition to the
foregoing structural peculiarity, are distinguished by the high or vaulted
contour of their carapace. In some the toes are slightly webbed, and their
habits are mainly carnivorous, indicating affinity with the flesh-eating
and essentially aquatic Terrapins.

Between the two, however, have been intercalated a little group, known as
the POND-TORTOISES, one species of which is found in Southern Europe, and a
nearly allied one in North America. These pond-tortoises are distinguished
by the smooth and depressed form of the carapace; the toes are fully
webbed, fitting them for an aquatic life; while a ligamentous hinge,
separating the anterior and posterior moieties of the plastron, enables
them to cover in and protect their retracted head and limbs, after the
manner of the Box-tortoises. The carapace of the European pond-tortoise
does not exceed 7½ inches in length, and is usually dark brown or black,
ornamented with yellow dots or radiating streaks. This species inhabits
both ponds and running water, and during the daytime creeps out on the
banks, like the Crocodiles, to bask in the sun. As with the Crocodiles,
however, the daytime does not represent the period of its greatest
activity, this being during the night. The pond-tortoises are highly
esteemed for the table in the countries where they are indigenous.

GIANT OR ELEPHANT-TORTOISES FROM THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS.

The elephant-like character of their limbs, whence they derive their name,
is well exemplified in these examples.]

The TRUE TERRAPINS are all tortoises of essentially aquatic habits,
differing, however, from the water-frequenting Pond-tortoises, last
referred to, in that they have no ligamentous hinge providing for the
hermetical closure of the carapace apertures. The carapace and plastron,
moreover, are firmly united by bone, so that the two form conjointly a
rigid, continuous shell, as in that of the typical Land-tortoises. The
terrapins are widely distributed, being found in North America, Japan,
China, the Persian Gulf, Spain, and North-west Africa. Terrapin ranks
highly as a table delicacy in the United States. The real DIAMOND-BACKED
species, however, is now becoming very scarce, the supply not being equal
to the demand, and many inferior varieties being substituted in its place.
The "fishing" for these terrapins is mainly prosecuted during the autumn
months, when the reptiles become dormant, and are easily discovered and
secured by probing the mud with sticks. The female terrapin, or "cow," as
it is designated, is considered the greater delicacy, the eggs, to the
number of twenty or thirty, usually found inside its body, being the _de
rigueur_ garnishing of the dainty dish. The diamond-terrapin rarely exceeds
a length of 7 inches; but some of the inferior varieties, or "Sliders," as
they are termed, are of much larger dimensions, and may weigh as much as 4
lbs.

[Illustration: _Photo by S. G. Payne & Son, Aylesbury, by permission of the
Hon. Walter Rothschild._

GIANT TORTOISE.

The giant tortoises, like the relatively diminutive European varieties, are
essentially herbivorous.]

From an æsthetic standpoint the PAINTED TERRAPIN undoubtedly bears the
palm. Its smooth, depressed carapace is not more than 6 inches long, and
its ground-colour is usually a dark olive-green, yellow lines bordering its
component central shields; the small marginal shields are sometimes almost
crimson with black markings, and the "bridge" uniting the carapace and
plastron exhibits the same brilliant coloration. The soft skin of the head,
neck, and other exposed parts have yellow and red bands on a brown or
blackish ground-colour. This beautiful little terrapin, which is a special
favourite for aquariums, is a native of Eastern North America.

Passing the small and not peculiarly conspicuous group of the AMERICAN
MUD-TERRAPINS, we arrive at the very distinctly differentiated family of
the SNAPPERS, SNAPPING-TURTLES, or ALLIGATOR-TERRAPINS, as they are
variously called. These likewise are exclusively confined in their
present-day distribution to the New World, though in former ages allied
species inhabited Europe. The alligator-terrapins are characterised by the
relatively small size of the carapace, within which the animal is unable to
completely retract its head and limbs, as in the preceding types. The head
is relatively large, and armed with a formidable hooked beak; while the
tail greatly exceeds in relative length that of any of the ordinary
tortoises or terrapins, and is scaly and crested somewhat like that of a
crocodile along its upper ridge, and has horny plates on the under-surface.
Their popular name has, in fact, been conferred upon these Chelonians on
the strength of their presenting the aspect to no inconsiderable extent of
an alligator's body, to which the carapace of an ordinary terrapin has been
united. The common alligator-terrapin, or snapping-turtle, is among aquatic
Chelonians an animal of considerable size. The carapace alone may be as
much or more than 20 inches long, and to this have to be added the thick
head and neck and elongated tail, which, taken together, are of almost
similar dimensions.

A second closely related member of this family, known by the name of
TEMMINCK'S SNAPPER, attains to yet longer proportions, and is the largest
known river-tortoise. The carapace in this species may measure over 2 feet
in length, and has three strongly marked longitudinal ridges. The head is
relatively larger and the tail somewhat shorter than in the preceding
species. It is a denizen of the southern districts of the United States,
being met with in Texas, Florida, and as far north as the Missouri.

The habits of the two species are stated to be identical. Both of them
frequent the rivers and swamps of the areas indicated, preferring the
waters that have a muddy bottom, and in some localities occurring in vast
numbers. As a rule they prefer lying in deep water near the centre of the
river or swamp they inhabit, but they also occasionally ascend to the
surface and float in midstream with outstretched necks. Like other
water-tortoises, they come on land to find suitable locations for
depositing their eggs. The name of Snappers, commonly applied to these
tortoises, bears reference to their inveterate habit of snapping and biting
viciously at everything placed within their reach. Even from the egg the
young of Temminck's species is wont to display this trait. The animals are
somewhat esteemed for food, and are consequently caught for the market.
They will take almost any bait, but manifest a predilection for fish.
Considerable caution has necessarily to be exercised in dealing with them
in the boats, and it is a common custom to decapitate them immediately they
are hauled on board, otherwise they are capable of inflicting the most
terrible wounds with their powerful cutting beaks on the persons of all or
any who may remain within their reach. Bathing in waters tenanted by the
pugnacious and distinctly aggressive snappers is a risky proceeding, and
many cases of serious injuries that have happened to incautious adventurers
in this direction have been recorded.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

A GIANT TORTOISE WITH A EUROPEAN TORTOISE ON ITS BACK.

Illustrating their comparative dimensions.]

The food of both the alligator and Temminck's snapper consists mainly of
fish, and where common these tortoises must be ranked among the most potent
agencies in denuding the rivers and lakes of their finny denizens. Not
content with fish, the larger examples have been known to drag under water
and devour such large water-fowl as ducks, and even geese. It is stated
that the snappers exhibit a surprising amount of agility in the water, and
swim after and capture the fish on which they feed. Such a feat seems
scarcely credible of a bulky adult individual, while, moreover, it is
provided with a remarkable and effective adaptation for taking its prey by
stratagem. A very fine example of Temminck's snapper was for many years
confined in a tank in the Reptile-house in the Regent's Park Zoological
Gardens. It usually lay prone at the bottom of its tank, giving little or
no signs of life throughout the day, but was wont to display more activity
and to move about its tank at night. At times, when ready for a fresh
food-supply, it was observed that it would lie motionless as a stone, as
usual, but with its mouth open to its widest gape. This attitude it would
maintain for several hours together. The singularity of this action was
that the gaping jaws displayed to view two elongate worm-like structures,
which sprang close to one another from the floor of the mouth just within
its entrance. These worm-like appendages were continually writhing to and
fro, and presented in both aspect and movements a most remarkable
resemblance to actual living worms. With this naturally provided decoy for
fish there can be no need for the snapper to exhaust its energies in the
strenuous pursuit of its quarry. To make the delusion complete, the head,
neck, and chin of Temminck's snapper are decorated with small lobular or
leaf-like membranous appendages resembling sponges or aquatic vegetation.
The solid grey-brown triangular head of the animal itself might easily be
mistaken for a piece of rock, and thus decorated with seemingly natural
growths the unwary fish come browsing along it, rush upon the wriggling
worms at the entrance of the cavernous chamber, and are lost. A photograph
of this interesting Chelonian is reproduced on page 560, which depicts it
with its mouth open, and indicates both the position and the presence of
the worm-like decoy-appendages.

[Illustration: _Photo by S. G. Payne & Son, Aylesbury, by permission of the

ELEPHANT-TORTOISE.

Illustrating the ample chamber-like space provided within the carapace for
the retraction of the head and limbs.]

There are several water-tortoises presenting a considerable external
resemblance to the forms already noticed which belong to distinct family
groups. Thus the MATAMATA TORTOISE of Northern Brazil has at first sight,
except for its short tail and nose-like proboscis, much in common with
Temminck's snapper. Fimbriated and foliaceous membranous outgrowths are
developed on the head and neck to a much more luxuriant degree, and it
would be interesting to ascertain if it possesses similar decoy-appendages
inside the mouth.

The so-called SNAKE-NECKED WATER-TORTOISES of South America, and the
LONG-NECKED aquatic ones of Australasia, possess modifications of
skull-structure and other details that indicate family distinctness. A
broad external character that serves to separate this group from the
Terrapins and all preceding forms is that the neck, when drawn within the
cavity of the carapace, is not flexed in the form of the letter S, but
simply bent sideways along the anterior margin of the body. The species
belonging to this group, which includes the Matamata, Snake-necked, and
Soft-shelled Water-tortoises, and also a few essentially terrestrial
species, are distinguished collectively by the appellation of the
"SIDE-NECKED" Tortoises.

TURTLES.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

SNAPPING-TURTLE.

Also known as the Alligator-terrapin, with reference to its long,
alligator-like tail.]

Certain of the Terrapins, or Water-tortoises, belonging to the groups above
described frequent saline river-estuaries and salt marshes, but none are
strictly marine. With the Turtle Family, however, we arrive at an
exclusively pelagic section, in which the animals are specially adapted for
life in the high seas, the walking-limbs of the terrestrial and fresh-water
species being replaced by long and powerful swimming-flippers. The shell in
these marine Chelonians is more or less heart-shaped and flattened, and the
carapace and plastron are always separate, and never united in a rigid
box-like form, as with the Land-tortoises. In common with those fresh-water
tortoises which pass the greater portion of their existence in lakes or
rivers, the MARINE TURTLES resort to the land to deposit their eggs. The
locations chosen are the sand-beaches or isolated sandy islets in tropical
oceans, wherein, after excavating hollows to receive them, the eggs are
covered up and left to hatch with the heat of the sun. The eggs of turtles
differ from those of the Land-tortoises and Terrapins in that their
external covering is soft or leathery. So soon as the young turtles are
hatched, they emerge from the sand, and instinctively make their way to the
water. Many, however, are the perils that beset their course, and few there
be out of perhaps 80 or 100 turtlets which gain the shore and get through
into deep water. Fish-hawks and sea-birds of every description are waiting
ready to pounce down upon them immediately they make their appearance, or
to thin their ranks as they run the gauntlet of perhaps 100 yards or so to
reach the sea in safety. Even at the waters edge the ordeal is by no means
passed. Shoals of the smaller sharks and other predatory fish are
continually cruising round in the shallow water, and have as high an
appreciation of the toothsomeness of tender turtle as the proverbial London
alderman. The writer was fortunate on one occasion, among the coral islands
on the Australian coasts, to light upon a young turtle brood just emerging
from their sandy nest. The majority were assisted to the sea, and a few,
reserved in the interests of science, were liberated in a bath of sea-water
to have their first swim. Snapshot photographs were taken, one of which,
reproduced on page 561, serves to illustrate the great relative length of
the paddle-like limbs at this early stage and the variety of postures
assumed during natation.

TEMMINCK'S SNAPPER.

The two white points visible on the lower jaw represent the pair of
worm-like appendages which the creature uses as a bait to attract or
capture fish.]

Of the typical Marine Turtles three distinctly characterised species are
recognised by zoologists. These are the GREEN TURTLE, indispensable for
soup at aldermanic banquets; the HAWKSBILL, or tortoiseshell-producing
turtle; and the LOGGERHEAD. Of these three, the green turtle and the
loggerhead more nearly resemble one another, and are apt to be confounded
by the uninitiated. Such an error is very readily detected when the
Chelonian comes to the table, the flesh of the loggerhead being rank and
utterly unfit for food. In order, however, to be wise before the event, and
to avoid a grievous misdirection of culinary energy--turtle being a
standard dish in the coral seas--it is only necessary to count the number
of large shield-like plates that flank each side of the central series in
the creature's carapace. In the true green or edible turtle there are only
four pairs of these large lateral shields, while in the loggerhead there
are never less than five, and sometimes more. The loggerhead-turtle also,
as its name implies, has a conspicuously larger and coarser head than the
esculent species. The fact that while the green turtle is a strict
vegetarian, feeding entirely on seaweeds, the loggerhead is altogether
carnivorous, readily accounts for the diametrically diverse gastronomic
properties of these two Chelonians. Both species attain to a considerable
size, over 3 feet in length (the loggerhead being the larger), and are
found inhabiting the same waters throughout the tropics.

The HAWKSBILL, or true tortoiseshell-producing turtle, never attains to
quite as large dimensions as the two preceding species, though its carapace
may measure as much as 2 feet 6 or 8 inches long. The structural feature
that at once distinguishes the hawksbill from either the green or
loggerhead species is the character of the horny shields developed on the
surface of the carapace. Instead of the edges meeting in juxtaposition, as
in those two forms, they overlap one another, like the scales of a fish,
and are notable for their thickness and their exceedingly beautiful but
variably marbled patterns. It is these marbled horny plates which
constitute the tortoise-shell of commerce. In young individuals the
substance is thin and very transparent, but thickens with advancing age,
until in old individuals the plates may vary from 1/8 to ¼ inch in
thickness. Like the two preceding species, the hawksbill, within tropical
seas, enjoys a cosmopolitan distribution. Its habits, like the
loggerhead's, are essentially carnivorous; but while the flesh is coarse
and rank, the eggs are valued for the table.

A remaining member of the Marine Turtle series is the so-called LUTH or
LEATHERY TURTLE. This Chelonian differs so materially in structure from the
foregoing species as to be referred to a distinct family. The horny plates,
so conspicuous in all the other types, are entirely absent, the bony
carapace, which is distinctly seven-ridged longitudinally, being covered
with a homogeneous leather-like skin. Both jaws are formidably hooked and
cutting throughout their edges, and the paddles are destitute of the two
rudimentary claws found in the preceding species. The leathery turtle grows
to an immense size; specimens have been recorded measuring as much as 8
feet in total length and weighing over 1,600 lbs. Its flesh is not only
unfit for food, but is reported to be of a poisonous character. The coasts
of Florida and Brazil are among the areas where the leathery turtle is met
with in the greatest abundance.

NEWLY HATCHED TURTLES ENJOYING THEIR FIRST SWIM.

The limbs at this early stage of their development are of an abnormal
length.]

The more ordinary method of capturing turtle for the market or to supply
the deficiencies of the larder aboard ship in tropical climates is to land
at night, preferably when the moon is full, on the islands to which the
females are in the habit of repairing to deposit their eggs. This function
is invariably discharged during the night hours, and unless the moon is up
the presence of the reptiles is not easily determined. Time is generally
given for the turtle to excavate its sand-burrow and lay its eggs, usually
over a hundred in number, the proper moment for the capture being that
when, the task accomplished, it sets forth to regain its more accustomed
element. The creature is then seized and turned suddenly upon its back,
where it is left to struggle and flounder helplessly, being perfectly
incapable of righting itself, while other captures are made. On outlying
coral islands, such as those of the Lacepedes, off the Western Australian
coast, several dozen of the Chelonians may represent one good night's haul,
the choice of the fittest examples being left until the return of daylight.

In many places turtles are pursued in the water and speared; while in some
locations, notably at Keeling Island, as recorded by Darwin, the animals
are chased by the natives in sailing-craft. One man steers the boat, the
other one standing in the bows on the look-out for turtle. A Chelonian
being sighted, an exciting stern chase ensues, and on coming abreast with
the quarry the look-out man plunges into the water straight upon the
turtle's back, and clings pertinaciously with both hands to the shell of
the neck until the creature is exhausted, when it is dragged into the boat.

[Illustration: _Photo by H. V. Letkmann._

CUBAN TERRAPINS.

In common with many other water-tortoises, or terrapins, this species is
essentially gregarious in its habits.]

The most remarkable method of taking turtle, however, is that practised in
Torres Straits, as also at Mozambique and formerly in the West Indies. The
sucking-fish, or remora, is in this case impressed into the service of the
human fishers. Taking advantage of the fish's natural propensity to swim
towards and adhere pertinaciously to any larger floating object, fishermen
go out with specimens kept alive in a small well in the bottom of their
boats. When in pursuit of turtle, a long light line is attached to the
fish's tail; and coming within sight of a Chelonian, the fish, with an
abundance of slack or pay-out line, is thrown in the direction of the
turtle. The remora immediately swims towards and adheres firmly to the
under surface of the shell of the turtle, when it will suffer its body to
be torn asunder rather than let go its hold of its newly gained sanctuary.
Should the turtle be a small one, both fish and turtle are dragged with the
line back to the boat. If, on the other hand, it is of large size, one of
the natives plunges into the water, and, following the line down, secures
the turtle.

In the island of Ascension the cultivation and breeding of turtles for
exportation in artificially constructed enclosures have for a considerable
time been the subject of an important industry. There are doubtless many
other locations on both the Australian coast-line and in the British West
Indies where this highly profitable trade could be established. In addition
to the green turtle, attention might also be profitably directed at the
same locations to the culture of the tortoiseshell-bearing species.
Tortoiseshell possesses the singular and useful property of being
susceptible of perfect amalgamation. Consequently a number of small-sized
pieces can be welded so indistinguishably with one another as to serve the
same use as the larger plates for commercial purposes. This amalgamation is
effected by bevelling the edges of the two pieces that it is desired to
unite along the proposed line of junction, and then, while they are held in
juxtaposition in a metallic press, submitting them to the action of boiling
water.

CHAPTER III.

_LIZARDS._

[Illustration: _Photo by E. C. Atkinson._

BLIND-WORM.

Notwithstanding its name, the blind-worm possesses small, very bright
little eyes.]

The Lizard Tribe or Sub-order is notable as containing a greater number of
specific forms than any other of the Reptilian groups, no less than 1,700
distinct species being described in the most recently published catalogues.
While formerly regarded as constituting a separate and independent order of
the Reptile Class, later investigations have demonstrated that lizards are
so intimately related through sundry intermediate types with the Snakes
that they cannot be recognised as constituting other than a sub-section of
the same order. The two groups of the Lizards and Snakes are consequently,
and with reference more particularly to their commonly shared scaly
armatures, technically distinguished by the appellation of Scaled Reptiles.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

GLASS-SNAKE, OR SCHELTOPUSIK.

The presence of movable eyelids distinguishes this legless lizard from the
true snakes.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

GLASS-SNAKE.

Snails constitute the favourite food of the glass-snake.]

While the more typical members of the Lizard Tribe are readily
distinguished from the Snakes by the possession of well-developed limbs, a
not inconsiderable number of species are altogether devoid of these
appendages, or possess them only in a partially developed or rudimentary
condition. The BRITISH BLIND-WORM, or SLOW-WORM, constitutes an example of
such a legless lizard, although on account of its outward snake-like
appearance it is commonly regarded as a snake by the uneducated. In the
South European so-called GLASS-SNAKE, or SCHELTOPUSIK, here figured, the
snake-like aspect and creeping habits are still more conspicuous, but yet
when examined more critically its lizard affinities become apparent. One of
the most readily apprehended external characters that serve to distinguish
this and the majority of the legless lizards from snakes is the possession
by the former of movable eyelids and conspicuous external ear-openings.
Among snakes eyelids are invariably absent, the eyes, by way of
compensation, being covered by transparent horny plates, which impart to
these creatures that peculiar stony stare which undoubtedly constitutes one
of the most repulsive features of their tribe. There are, however, a few
exceptional lizards devoid of eyelids, though these species do not take a
snake-like form.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BURMESE GECKOS.

One of the largest members of the tribe, measuring 8 or 10 inches in
length.]

Lizards, while distributed throughout temperate and tropical regions,
attain to the zenith of their representation in size, number, and variety
of form and colour in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The majority of
species are essentially sun-worshippers, and in temperate climates, such as
that of England, where they are but sparsely represented, pass the
cheerless winter months in a state of torpid hibernation.

BURMESE GECKO.

The first position among the Lizard Tribe is usually accorded to the GECKO
FAMILY--a group numbering 280 species, which present several somewhat
anomalous features and characteristics. In the first place, in
contradistinction to the majority of lizard forms, they are for the most
part nocturnal in their habits, and have their eyes specially modified to
meet them. Geckos, as the exception to the ordinary lizards previously
referred to, possess no eyelids, and the pupil of the eye, as seen in broad
daylight, is mostly represented by a narrow vertical slit, like that of a
cat or a nocturnal dog-fish. As the night approaches, however, the
membranous diaphragm is retracted, displaying to view a symmetrically
orbicular pupil of abnormal size and luminosity. Another prominent
characteristic of the geckos is the peculiar modification of their feet,
which in most instances are furnished with adhesive disks or pads, which
enable these lizards to run with ease, after the manner of flies, on the
smooth surface of a wall or window-pane, or even along the ceiling. It is
further noteworthy of the geckos that they are the only lizards which
possess the power of emitting distinct vocal sounds. The name Gecko is, in
point of fact, derived from the fancied resemblance to the word that
constitutes the shrill, somewhat bird-like note of one of the most familiar
species. "Tok," "toki," "chick, chick," "checko," and "tocktoo" are
distinctive call-notes that are respectively associated with other members
of the Gecko Family.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

MADEIRAN GECKOS.

Madeiran geckos photographed through a glass window-pane, showing the
peculiar formation of their adhesive toe-pads. One example is regrowing its
recently amputated tail. These geckos often travel from Madeira to Covent
Garden Market among banana bunches.]

The geckos are most numerously represented in the Indian and Australasian
regions. None of them attain to large dimensions. They rarely exceed 1 foot
in total length, and most frequently measure some 3 or 4 inches only.

Geckos, in common with many other lizards, are notable for the facility
with which their tail becomes detached and left in the hands of their
would-be captor. In course of time a new tail sprouts out from the
truncated stump of the original member, and within a few more months equals
it in dimensions. It not infrequently happens that two or even three new
tail-sprouts take the place of the original appendage, imparting to the
little creature a most bizarre appearance. The above photograph includes an
example of the Madeiran species in which a new tail-bud of a normal
character has just commenced to grow.

The nearest approach to the phenomenon of flight among lizards occurs in
what are known as the FLYING-DRAGONS, belonging to the family of the
Agamas, which next invites attention. These lizards are all of relatively
small size, not exceeding a few inches in length, and inhabit the
Indo-Malayan region. In these singularly specialised forms six or seven of
the posterior ribs are abnormally produced on each side of the body, and so
united together by thin, semi-transparent membrane as to form a pair of
wing-like expansions. When not in use, these structures are folded, after
the manner of a fan, closely against the animal's sides, while, when
extended, they constitute a most effective parachute, wherewith the little
creatures accomplish flying leaps from tree to tree, after the manner of
the Flying-squirrels and Phalangers. The colour of these wing-like
structures varies among the many different specific forms, being in some
instances spotted or reticulated like those of a butterfly.

FLYING-DRAGON OF JAVA.

A lizard with wing-like membranes supported by the abnormally developed
ribs. It takes long flights from tree to tree.]

This same family of the Agamoid Lizards includes a number of species of
very dissimilar aspect and habits, which are almost exclusively confined to
the Old World or Oriental zoological region. Australia in particular is
remarkably rich in representatives of this group, many of them of
considerable size. Certain of these have within recent years been found to
be endowed with the power of bipedal locomotion. The FRILLED LIZARD of
Queensland and the northern territories of Western Australia was the first
species in which this bipedal habit was authentically demonstrated in
connection with examples observed in Australia and also brought to England
by the writer, one of the last-named examples furnishing the photographs
reproduced on page 567. In other respects this lizard is one of the most
remarkable of its tribe. The peculiar Elizabethan collar-like frill,
capable of erection or depression at the creature's will, imparts to it a
most singular appearance. When at rest or undisturbed, this membranous
frill-like structure is folded down in neat, symmetrical pleats around the
lizard's neck. Should the creature be approached by man or dog or other
aggressive animal, the mouth springs open to its widest, and simultaneously
with this action the frill is erected like the sudden opening of an
umbrella, and stands out at right angles around the neck, imparting to it a
most formidable and threatening aspect. Dogs, in fact, which will
habitually chase and kill larger lizards, such as the Monitors, will
frequently halt and retire discomfited when confronted with a frilled
lizard at bay with its frill erected. The brilliant colour of this frill,
more especially in the male, adds very considerably to the formidable
appearance of this lizard. While the body of this lizard is usually of a
light brown colour, with more or less distinct darker transverse bars and
reticulations, the frill-like membrane has a ground-colour in which orange
and chrome-yellow chiefly predominate, and upon which are superimposed
splashings and speckles of brilliant scarlet. While the total length of
this averages 2 feet, the expanded frill in adult males is not infrequently
as much as 8 or 9 inches in diameter. The peculiar, grotesquely human
aspect presented by the frilled lizard when running on its hind legs only
will be appreciated on reference to the accompanying photographs. This
erect attitude is only assumed when the frilled lizard is traversing more
or less considerable distances and moving on level ground. Under other
circumstances it progresses on all-fours, after the manner of the ordinary
members of its class.

FRILLED LIZARD RUNNING ON ITS HIND LEGS (BROADSIDE VIEW).]

Several other lizards belonging to the family group of the Agamas have been
demonstrated by the writer to move in the same manner as the frilled
species. LESEUR'S WATER-LIZARD, also a Queensland form, which attains to a
length of 3 or 4 feet, is a notable example in this connection. As implied
by its name, it is semi-aquatic in its habits. It frequents scrubs in the
neighbourhood of river-banks and backwaters, and passes a considerable
portion of its time in shallow water with only its nostrils elevated above
the surface. It is a most expert swimmer, sculling itself with grace and
rapidity, aided only by its long, laterally compressed tail. Examples
brought to England and kept alive for some years by the writer were
observed, in hot weather more particularly, to sleep at nights in their
water-tanks.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN TREE-LIZARD.

This species also runs on its hind legs.]

The several instances of bipedal locomotion among living lizards, as here
chronicled, are of especial interest in correlation with the circumstance
that certain extinct Dinosaurs habitually progressed on their hind limbs
only. They, in fact, have left "footprints on the sands of time" which
indubitably prove this assumption. There is, however, no relationship
between the two groups, and the resemblance is one of pure analogy, just as
both bats and birds fly, although they have no kinship.

Among other interesting lizards included in the Agama Family, mention may
be made of the singular JEW or BEARDED LIZARD of Australia--a flattened,
broad-set form, some 14 or 15 inches long, brown in hue, and clothed with
rough imbricated scales, but whose chief peculiarity consists of the
expansive beard-like development of the cuticle immediately underneath the
animal's chin. As in the frilled lizard, this cuticular excrescence is only
conspicuous when the creature is excited, at other times being contracted
and indistinguishable from an ordinary skin-fold. When retiring to rest,
these lizards, in their adult state, almost invariably climb up and cling
to the rough bark of a convenient tree, and when young and more slender
will also ascend saplings, on which they sleep, clinging by their
interlocked claws.

Another member of the Agama Family which invites brief notice is the
so-called YORK DEVIL, or MOUNTAIN-DEVIL, of Western and Central Australia.
This lizard is of comparatively small size, rarely exceeding 6 or 7 inches
in length. Its feeble form and stature, however, are abundantly compensated
for by the complex panoply of spines and prickles by which its head and
limbs and body are effectually protected. The natural food of this singular
lizard consists exclusively of ants, the small black, evil-smelling species
which often proves itself a pest by its invasion of the Australian
colonists' houses being its prime favourite. These are picked up one by one
by the rapid flash-like protrusion and retraction of the little creature's
adhesive tongue, and the number of ants which are thus assimilated by a
Moloch lizard at a single meal is somewhat astonishing. A number of
examples of this species were kept by the writer in Australia, and their
gastronomic requirements fully satisfied every day by taking them into the
garden and placing them in communication with a swarming ant-track. By
careful observation it was found that no less than from 1,000 to 1,500 ants
were devoured by each lizard at a single sitting. The ant-devouring
proclivities of these prickly little lizards can no doubt be turned to very
useful and effective account in clearing ant-infested domiciles, and were
in fact thus utilised by the writer on more than one occasion.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN WATER-LIZARD.

This lizard is of aquatic habits, and runs on its hind legs when traversing
long distances.]

The lizards included in the Agama Family are essentially inhabitants of the
Eastern Hemisphere, none occurring in America. In the western continent,
however, we find an equally extensive but structurally distinct group which
presents many singularly corresponding types. This family comprises the
true IGUANAS, many of them of considerable size, and a numerous assemblage
of smaller forms. Among those species which present a striking parallel in
size and aspect to the peculiarly characteristic Old World Agamas, mention
may be made of the little so-called HORNED TOAD, or SPINY LIZARD, of
California and other of the North American States. This species might
readily be taken by the uninitiated for a near relation of the Australian
Moloch Lizard, or Mountain-devil, last described, its flattened diminutive
form and bristling spiny armature seemingly justifying such a supposition.
The crucial test afforded by the character of the dentition, however,
distinctly indicates its true position to be with the Iguanas. In the
Agamas the teeth are invariably developed from the apex, or summit, of the
jaw. These teeth, moreover, are varied in character. In the Iguanas, on the
other hand, the teeth are all more or less uniform in character, and are
attached to the outer sides of the jaw.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN WATER-LIZARD.

Showing attitude when running.]

The larger iguanas are, for the most part, exclusively fruit- and
vegetable-feeders, and arboreal in their habits. The thick forest scrubs in
the vicinity of streams and rivers are their favourite resort. After the
manner of the Australian water-lizards, these iguanas are expert swimmers,
and delight in lying along the overhanging branches, whence at the
slightest alarm they can precipitate themselves into the water beneath.
When swimming, the fore limbs are folded back against the sides, the tail
only being used as a means of propulsion. Several of the larger iguanas,
such as the common or tuberculated species, attain to a considerable
length, 5 or 6 feet; their bodies are proportionably thick, and the white
flesh, in this last-named variety more particularly, is highly esteemed as
a table delicacy. The common TUBERCULATED IGUANA is an essentially handsome
species, its skin being variegated with bands and shadings of brown and
green, which are lightest and brightest in the males and younger
individuals; the neck and snout and jaws are decorated with projecting,
rounded tubercles; a large, baggy, dewlap-like membrane, capable of
inflation at the animal's will, depends from the chin and throat; and a
deeply serrated crest of elevated scales extends from behind the head, down
the centre of the back, nearly to the extremity of the tail.

AUSTRALIAN JEW OR BEARDED LIZARDS.

BEARDED LIZARD.

The Iguana Family includes a species with essentially marine proclivities,
this being the GALAPAGOS SEA-LIZARD. This animal was first discovered to
science by the late Mr. Charles Darwin, who found it in considerable
numbers on the shores of the islands which constitute the Galapagos group.
The lizards were observed to spend much of their time swimming in the sea,
but at no very great distance from the land. Experiments proved that they
could live for a very considerable interval entirely submerged, examples
sunk with weights for as much as an hour emerging entirely unaffected from
the ordeal.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

A YOUNG BEARDED LIZARD.

Showing its habitual sleeping attitude.]

While the Iguanas may be described as essentially American, one or two
exceptional forms are found inhabiting the relatively remote regions of the
Fiji Islands and Madagascar. The so-called FIJI BANDED IGUANA (photographs
of a pair of which, once in the writer's possession, are reproduced on page
575) is a very beautiful creature. The body is shapely and well
proportioned, and terminates in a tail of abnormal length--equal to quite
twice that of the body--the entire dimensions measuring some 3 feet. The
male is much more bright in hue than the female; for while the latter is
usually of a uniform light green throughout, the male is variegated, with
broad, alternating bands of brightest emerald-green and pale French grey.
Around the lips and eyes there are lines of brightest yellow, and the
throat is almost pure white.

The small group of GIRDLE-TAILED LIZARDS belongs exclusively to the African
and Madagascan regions, its typical representative being the Cape and
Orange River Colony species, illustrated on page 575. The symmetrical
whorls of long, spinous scales encircling the tail in this and the allied
forms constitute a prominent feature, and have originated the popular name
of Girdle-tails.

AUSTRALIAN YORK OR MOUNTAIN-DEVIL.

A spinous lizard which inhabits the arid plains of Central Australia.]

The most aberrant representatives of the Lizard Tribe, with regard to one
very important characteristic, are undoubtedly the two species of HELODERM,
or "SILATICA," as they are called by the natives. These reptiles (page 576)
occupy the unenviable position of being the only known lizards which
possess poisonous properties, their bite having been demonstrated to be
fatal to smaller mammals, and to be attended by very serious symptoms in
the case of human subjects being bitten. The more common MEXICAN HELODERM
has been in residence at the Zoo for many years; it attains to a length of
from 18 to 20 inches, and its stout, squat body, short limbs, warty skin,
and peculiar colouring are calculated at first sight to awaken a feeling of
revulsion in the beholder. Like the wasp, the salamander, and other animals
whose conspicuous tints indicate their poisonous or other baneful
properties, the heloderm is distinguished by a lurid ground-colour, varying
in individuals from yellow-orange to flesh-pink, upon which are
superimposed bold, network-like markings of blue-black or dark brown tints.
Along the tail these reticulations usually take the form of more or less
irregular rings.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SPINOUS LIZARD, OR MOUNTAIN-DEVIL.

This species feeds exclusively upon ants.]

Although the heloderms possess such deadly properties, those at the Zoo
manifest a by no means aggressive disposition, and allow their keeper or
even strangers to handle them with impunity. In experiments purposely made
to substantiate or refute the previously current rumours as to the
poisonous nature of these animals, two guinea-pigs succumbed to bites
received in the course of the day. The owner of the reptiles, who was also
bitten on one occasion through incautiously handling, suffered very severe,
though happily not fatal, effects. In connection with its poison-dealing
properties it is found that it possesses certain long and fang-like teeth,
which are set loosely in the jaws, and which have grooves before and behind
for the transmission of the poison, which is secreted by special glands
situated close to their base. The favourite habitat of the heloderm is the
arid, sandy, and stony region on the western side of the Cordillera
mountain-range. It is at the same time said to be rarely seen in those
parts except during the rainy season, and also to be for the most part
nocturnal in its habits.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

A GROUP OF MOUNTAIN-DEVILS OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.

The spines of these lizards are so sharp that they will pierce a tender
hand.]

The family group of the MONITORS includes the largest of existing lizards,
notably the semi-aquatic form common to North Australia and the Malay
Peninsula and adjacent islands, which attains a length of 8 or 10 feet, and
is not infrequently mistaken, as it rushes, on being disturbed, through the
reeds and other rank herbage to the water, for a young crocodile. An
exceedingly fine and well set-up example of these huge water-monitors, shot
by Captain Stanley Flower in the neighbourhood of Singapore, is placed in
the Reptile Gallery of the Natural History Museum.

Another species, indigenous to the Southern Australian States, and having
essentially arboreal habits, commonly attains to a length of 5 or 6 feet.
The skin of one example of this species, obtained for the writer from the
eucalyptus forests in Gippsland, Victoria, measures no less than 7 feet
long. With reference to the elegant lace-like pattern of its skin-markings,
this species is frequently associated with the suggestive title of the
LACE-LIZARD. Among the more illiterate settlers it is generally known as a
Gooana, the name being obviously a corruption of Iguana, and being, as a
matter of fact, applied promiscuously, and in all cases incorrectly, to a
number of the larger Australian lizards.

HORNED TOAD.

All the members of the Monitor Tribe are inveterate egg-eaters. An Egyptian
species, the NILE MONITOR, renders service to humanity through the
gratification of this propensity in seeking out and devouring the eggs of
the crocodile. The larger water-monitor of the North Australian and Malay
regions has been reported to the writer to be particularly partial to the
eggs of the turtle, digging them out of the sand in which the parent
deposits them, and destroying them wholesale. The more strictly arboreal
Southern Australian species preys to a very large extent on birds' eggs,
climbing to the holes in the trunks and branches in which so many
Australian birds build their nests, and not infrequently capturing and
devouring also the parent birds and young. In the "bush" settlements this
monitor is notorious for its depredations among the hen-roosts, both eggs
and young chickens falling victims to its insatiable appetite. It is
consequently regarded with but scant favour by poultry-farmers, who
frequently organise a "gooana" hunt for its special destruction. If
surprised out in the open, the quarry at once rushes for a tree, and
manifests the most remarkable agility in "swarming" up the smooth, massive
trunk, and in dodging round to the side opposite to that on which the
sportsman approaches. Not infrequently, trees being remote, the monitor
will make for what appears to its apprehension the best substitute for
one--viz. the upright figure of the nearest sportsman. Should this happen
to be a "new chum" enjoying his maiden essay in "gooana" hunting, he will
undoubtedly experience a new sensation as the animal, with its sharp
cat-like claws, unceremoniously scrambles up to his head and shoulders.

HORNED TOAD.

This species is highly prized for its insect-destroying proclivities.]

Brought to bay, a monitor possesses a more formidable weapon than its teeth
and claws wherewith to repulse the onslaught of the enemy. The long, tough,
thong-like tail--not brittle and replaceable, as in many other lizards--is
converted, for the time being, into a veritable stock-whip, wherewith it
will most severely punish incautious aggressors who venture too near. The
potency of this offensive and defensive weapon is fully recognised by the
reptile-keepers at the Zoo, who freely admit their reluctance to enter the
cage of one of these large, long-tailed, but conversely very short-tempered
monitors. All of the monitors, in consonance with their pre-eminently
carnivorous habits, are more or less savage and intractable. The several
species which have fallen within the writer's cognisance proved no
exception to the rule. An Egyptian example, injudiciously introduced to the
select society of his extensive miscellaneous collection in a heated
greenhouse, proved to be a veritable wolf in the fold, killing several of
the choicest specimens before its vindictive propensities were detected and
arrested. A comparatively small and rare spiny-tailed monitor, brought by
the writer, in company with the frilled lizards, to England from North-west
Australia, would harass and bite any other lizard placed with it, and
resent every friendly overture on the part of its owner, even after so much
as a whole twelvemonth's persistent attempts to tame it. Another, the South
Australian monitor, or lace-lizard, was no exception to the rule, and had
to be maintained in solitary confinement. This particular specimen,
nevertheless, evinced, as the following anecdote will show, a very
pronounced affection for its provided quarters. One day it effected its
escape from the wire-enclosed cage with which it was accommodated in the
writer's Brisbane garden, and after prolonged but unsuccessful searchings
it was given up for lost. Considerable astonishment was naturally
experienced some ten days later, when the animal was discovered in the
garden making frantic attempts to regain access to its former prison-house.
During its ten days' absence it had evidently fallen upon evil times, for
not only was it in a very emaciated condition, but also bereft of its long
and handsome tail. Apparently, after the manner of its tribe, it had been
manifesting a too warm interest in some neighbour's hen-roost, and received
across its tail a stroke with a spade or other cutting instrument that was
intended for a more vital region. Disgusted by such unfriendly treatment,
it evidently determined that free board and lodging at the hands of its
former owner, albeit with the sacrifice of freedom, was a pleasanter line
of life than liberty and a precarious commissariat, with added bodily
risks. An almost identical episode of the voluntary return to captivity of
an escaped monitor has been reported to the writer of a species from Borneo
by Dr. G. D. Haviland.

TUBERCULATED IGUANA.

This species is esteemed for food by American Indians.]

The monitors, as a rule, are not distinguished for brilliancy of colouring,
shades and mottlings of brown or black being usually dominant. The male of
the Australian lace-lizard, after newly changing its coat, is, however, an
exception. In addition to the highly ornate lace-like reticulated pattern
of its skin-markings, previously referred to, the throat of the animal is
resplendent with mingled tints of sky-blue and lemon-yellow. It is
necessary, however, to observe that its natural surroundings and the ardent
rays of a sub-tropical sun are requisite to bring these brighter tints to
their full development. Examples kept in close confinement in the London
Zoological Gardens yield little or no indication of their colour
potentialities.

WALL-LIZARD.

This species is particularly abundant in Italy.]

While the Monitor Family is not represented on the American Continent, we
find there another group of lizards whose members are of considerable size,
and agree in their carnivorous propensities and general habits in a marked
manner with the Monitors. These are the "GREAVED" LIZARDS, named with
reference to the peculiar skin-folding on their legs. One of the largest
and most familiarly known representatives of this group is the TEGUEXIN, or
DIAMOND-LIZARD, indigenous to the greater portion of tropical South
America, and also to the West Indies. This lizard attains to a total length
of a yard or more, and is of a robust and thick-set build, with the hind
limbs much longer and stouter than the front ones. The colour of the
teguexin is also notable, the ground-tint being olive or tawny yellow, upon
which are superimposed black bands and markings which for the most part
take a transverse direction. Like the Monitors, the teguexin in captivity
exhibits a sulky and aggressive disposition, and cannot be safely kept in
company with other less powerful species.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BANDED IGUANAS.

A rare species from the Fiji Islands. Male to the right; female without
bands to the left. The example crouching between them is a bearded lizard.]

The attribute of bipedal locomotion is possessed by the teguexin. That this
singular method of progression was an accomplishment possessed by one of
the larger tropical American lizards was first reported to the writer from
Trinidad. Some species of iguana was, in the first instance, anticipated to
be the acrobatic performer. Several examples of this family group were
accordingly put through their paces at the Zoo, to ascertain if they could
lay claim to the distinction. None of the iguanas available, however, rose
(on their hind legs) to the occasion, and it was only on experimenting, as
a _dernière ressource_, with the teguexin that a successful demonstration
was accomplished. This lizard was found, in fact, to run bipedally more
freely and persistently, when sufficient space was allotted it, than the
Agamas. It seems singular that this bipedal power of locomotion should have
so long remained undiscovered, and yet is possessed by lizards which have
for a number of years been the denizens of many zoological gardens and
other menageries. The fact that a comparatively large level area is a _sine
qua non_ for the exhibition of this phenomenon affords no doubt the
explanation of this anomaly; but the anomaly itself at the same time serves
to accentuate the desirability, in the interests of both science and the
animals' comfort, that exists for providing them in captivity with a more
liberal and reasonably sufficient space for their indulgence in those
methods of locomotion that are natural to them in their native land.

SOUTH AFRICAN GIRDLED LIZARD.

Remarkable for the spiny armature, which is arranged in concentric
girdles.]

The Greaved Lizard Family includes somewhat over one hundred species. While
the majority agree with the teguexin in the possession of well-developed
limbs, there are a few retrograde forms in which the hinder limbs are
entirely absent or the front ones reduced to mere stumps. These exceptional
instances pave the way to the family of the Amphisbænas, in which such or a
still lower phase of limb development represents the normal condition. The
Amphisbænas are remarkable for their worm-like resemblance, and for the
circumstances that they live like earth-worms in burrows, that their eyes
are functionless (being concealed beneath the skin), and that they are
without ears. Other details of structure indicate a most rudimentary
condition of development, and they consequently rank as the lowest group in
the Lizard series. Another peculiarity of the Amphisbænas is that, in place
of scales, the skin of the body is divided into square segments, which form
symmetrical rings like those of worms. In addition to this, these
retrograde lizards possess the worm-like faculty of being able to move
backwards and forwards in their burrows with equal facility. It is from
this peculiar property that their title of Amphisbæna, signifying "moving
both ways," is derived. The representatives of this family, including
between sixty and seventy species, are widely distributed, being found in
America, the West Indies, Africa, and also European countries that border
the Mediterranean.

ARIZONA HELODERM (POISONOUS LIZARD).

In the warted texture of its skin-surface the heloderm differs
conspicuously from other lizards.]

While the Teguexins present resemblances in one direction with the
Amphisbænas, or Worm-like Lizards, the higher or Monitor-like forms have
much in common with the Typical or True Lizards, of which two small but
well-known species--the SAND- and VIVIPAROUS LIZARDS--are indigenous to the
British Isles. All the members of the True Lizards, numbering some hundred
species, are inhabitants of the Old World, becoming scarce, however,
towards the far east of the Asiatic Continent. All possess shapely bodies
and well-developed limbs with five-toed feet, and are remarkable for the
extreme activity of their movements, and in many cases brilliant colouring.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

WHITE MONITOR.

This and other allied species appear to be dead as they lie basking in the
sun.]

The varying individual shades of the GREEN LIZARD's brilliant emerald body
are almost infinite, no two being quite precisely alike in this respect. In
some a yellower, in others a bluer green predominates, while the females
and young are more or less mottled or striped with brown. The under surface
of the body is usually a more or less bright yellow, and the throat, in the
males more particularly, at the breeding-season is frequently brilliant
blue. The more conspicuous colour differences exhibited by this lizard are,
however, intimately associated with the local habitat of the particular
race. Those indigenous to Spain and Portugal, for example, are more or less
ornamented with ocellated spots along the sides of the head and body, while
those peculiar to Eastern Europe and Asia Minor are, in the young condition
more particularly, marked with longitudinal streaks, but their throat is
never blue.

GREEN LIZARD.

The tail of the green lizard is brittle, and breaks off in the hand if the
animal is held up by it. A new tail grows from the fractured joint in
course of time.]

The green lizard is one of the most beautiful of its tribe, and, although
not indigenous to Great Britain, is common in the Channel Islands. In
Jersey, more especially during the summer months, it is one of the most
familiar of the "common objects of the country," as it darts in and out of
the hedgerows after flies and other insects, or basks in the bright
sunshine on some stone wall, with its emerald-green body flattened out in
order to absorb the greatest possible amount of heat. As the colder autumn
days advance this lizard is rarely visible, and it finally retires into
some rocky cleft or burrow in the hedge-bank, and is no more seen until the
return of spring. Green lizards, liberated in suitably mild spots in the
South of England, have been known to thrive for brief periods, but succumb
to the cold of an extra-severe winter.

OCELLATED LIZARDS AT HOME.

The most brilliantly coloured of living lizards. The body is bright
emerald-green, decorated on the sides with azure-blue spots.]

The largest representatives of the green lizard are those inhabiting
Eastern Europe and Asia Minor, where in size and colour they almost
imperceptibly merge into the PEARLY or OCELLATED LIZARD. This very handsome
species, which, in company with examples of the green lizard, is frequently
imported by London dealers, ranges from 16 inches to close upon 2 feet in
length. In form it is stouter and more robust than a typical green lizard,
the head in the old males more particularly being exceptionally massive.
Whatever may be lacking in grace of form is, however, fully compensated for
by brilliancy of colouring, no other lizard, in fact, out-rivalling it in
this respect. To the brilliant shagreen-patterned emerald-green hues of the
Jersey species it has superadded along its sides eye-like spots of
brilliant turquoise or ultra-marine, with dark brown or black encircling
lines. In the males the green ground-colour has a more distinctly golden
hue, while in the young individuals the body is more usually olive-colour,
dotted throughout with whitish or pearly-blue, black-edged spots. This
beautiful lizard is unfortunately somewhat irascible in temper, and will
not as a rule allow itself to be handled as freely as the majority of the
members of its tribe; when biting, moreover, it has a tendency to fasten
itself upon the object seized with bulldog-like tenacity, a grip from a
powerful-jawed old male being a somewhat unpleasant experience. In addition
to insects the ocellated lizard will prey upon any other small animals it
can overpower, including the members of its own species; it is consequently
not safe to entrust it in the company of other lizards of less size and
strength.

The Skink Family, which next invites attention, contains no less than 400
known species, and, climatic conditions being favourable, enjoys an almost
cosmopolitan distribution. The majority of its members have stoutish
cylindrical bodies, with relatively short limbs and tail; the legs are
sometimes reduced to two only, or altogether aborted, giving the animal a
snakelike form.

The COMMON or "MEDICINAL" SKINK--so called since it was regarded in the
Middle Ages as an infallible medicinal nostrum--is an inhabitant of North
Africa, and notable for its adaptation to a sand-burrowing existence. The
body is short, cylindrical, exceedingly smooth through the close apposition
of the minute surface-scales, and sharply conical at each extremity. The
well-developed toes of all four feet are flattened and serrated at their
edges in such a manner that they constitute most effective burrowing-tools
in the loose sand these lizards frequent. The length of this skink rarely
exceeds 3 or 4 inches. Its colour is rather exceptional for a lizard, but
at the same time in keeping with its predominating subterranean habits. The
ground-tint in the living examples in the writer's possession, one of which
is photographed on page 579, was a light yellowish-white, like that of old
polished ivory, with here and there a pale flesh-pink tinge. On the
under-surface this light tint was persistent, while the back was traversed
by some twelve broadish bands of pale slate-grey. The skink does not, like
the mole and the Amphisbænas, obtain its food from subterranean sources. It
comes out to bask on the surface of the sand when the sun is at its height,
and keeps a brisk look-out for flies or other insects, which, if they
approach sufficiently near, are pounced upon with remarkably agility.
Should the sky become overcast or any cause for alarm manifest itself, the
skink disappears beneath the sand as though by magic, not infrequently
burrowing down to a depth of several feet. Even at the present day the
skink is esteemed by the Arabs both for medicine and food, and in the
latter association, well broiled, has won the commendation of European
palates.

well illustrated by this photograph.]

One of the most bizarre members of the Skink Family hails from Australia,
where it is known as the STUMP-TAILED LIZARD. The most remarkable feature
in this form is the shortness and roundness of the caudal appendage, the
contour and proportions of which, in fact, so nearly correspond with those
of the head that it was originally described by its discoverer, Captain
William Dampier, just over three centuries ago, as a double-headed animal.
To quote his own quaint description: "The land animals we saw here [Sharks'
Bay] included a sort of guanos of the same shape and size with other
guanos, but differing from them in three remarkable particulars, for these
had a larger and uglier head, and had no tail, and at the rump, instead of
a tail there, they had a stump of a tail which appeared like another head,
but not really, such being without mouth or eyes; yet this creature seemed
by this means to have a head at each end."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

COMMON SKINK.

Lives and burrows in the sand, coming out when the sun shines.]

A specimen of the stump-tailed lizard is usually on view at the Regent's
Park Gardens, and will afford visitors an opportunity for its comparison in
the flesh with Dampier's description. Fine specimens of the stump-tail will
measure as much as 10 inches in length, and are thick in proportion, the
legs, however, being very small and weak. The surface of the back is
covered with large, overlapping scales, that, in conjunction with its
customarily dark brown or blackish hue, convey to it a marked resemblance
to a long, imbricated fir-cone. On the under-surface the scales are in
comparison very small; the colouring in this region is also usually light
grey or yellow, variegated with darker reticulations.

Stump-tails make most good-natured and grotesque household pets. Of two
examples which were for some years in the writer's possession a
characteristic photograph is reproduced below. When basking in the sun, the
tail often becomes distended to enormous proportions. The internal
substance of this abnormally dilated organ consists chiefly of fatty
tissue, and it seems probable that it fulfils the rôle of a reservoir for
the storage of nutrient and heating materials, to be drawn upon during
hibernation. The winter months in the southern districts of Western
Australia are cold, and this lizard, in common with other local species,
retires during that season into the sheltering recess of a hollow
tree-stump or rock-crevice until the sun is again in the ascendant. The
stump-tail is practically omnivorous in its habits. In captivity fruit, and
more especially bananas, constitute a favourite diet, but it will also
greedily devour worms, beetles, and garden-snails, and may consequently be
turned to good account as a destroyer of garden-pests.

AUSTRALIAN STUMP-TAILED LIZARDS.

Two of the author's household pets.]

Of other Australian members of the Skink Family, the GREAT CYCLODUS, or
BLUE-TONGUED LIZARD, may be mentioned. This species, which is about 18
inches long, presents no abnormal development of head or tail, as in the
form last described. The body is smooth and sub-cylindrical, and with its
closely set scales resembles that of a snake. The dominant colour is a soft
steel or silvery grey, variegated with darker or lighter cross-bands and
reticulations that are most strongly marked on the sides; the
under-surface, by way of contrast, is most usually pale salmon-pink. The
tongue of this lizard, which gives to it its popular title, is somewhat
remarkable. It is large and flat, and of a bright blue tint, resembling
nothing so much as a piece of blue flannel. The animal, as it moves about,
is in the habit of constantly protruding and retracting its tongue, which
consequently constitutes a very conspicuous object. In common with the
majority of its allies, the blue-tongued lizard is viviparous; but while
the stump-tail only produces one at a time, which is nearly half as large
as the parent, the present form gives birth to as many as ten or twelve. An
example in the writer's possession on one occasion presented him with a
litter embracing the larger number, and afforded the material for the
photograph here reproduced.

BLUE-TONGUED LIZARDS.

A female with her family of twelve.]

As a contrast to the two preceding forms, the SPINE-TAILED LIZARDS, with
their short, flat, spiky tails, may be cited as a conclusion to this notice
of the Skink Family. There are nine known members of the same genus, all
inhabitants of Australia. The lower of the two forms here figured is
especially abundant on one island of the Abrolhos group, off the Western
Australian coast. This example is represented at about two-thirds of its
natural size. It is an interesting fact that an allied but considerably
larger species monopolises a neighbouring island of the same group, the two
species not intermingling: probably the larger one would prey on the
smaller. The largest member of the genus, known as CUNNINGHAM'S SPINE-TAIL,
of a uniform black hue, peppered white, is not infrequently brought to
Europe, and two examples which were for some years in the writer's
possession bred regularly, producing eight or ten young at a time for
several consecutive years. The fact that these lizards enjoyed full liberty
in a heated greenhouse, with a temperature and surrounding conditions
closely identical with those to which they were naturally accustomed, no
doubt contributed extensively to their fertility.

of an enormous number have been mentioned at all.

CHAMÆLEONS.

CHAMÆLEONS ASLEEP.

The tail of the sleeping chamæleon is frequently coiled spirally like the
proboscis of a butterfly.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

A CHAMÆLEON IN A RAGE.

Puffing and hissing at an approaching intruder.]

The CHAMÆLEONS differ in so many important structural points from the
ordinary lizards that they are usually regarded now by scientists as a
distinct reptilian sub-order. The essential characters, externally
recognisable, that serve to distinguish the chamæleons are:--Firstly, the
extraordinary development of their worm-like extensile tongue, the tip of
it club-shaped and highly viscous, and the shaft cylindrical and as elastic
in texture as india-rubber. Adapted for the special object of catching
flies, this organ can be projected from the mouth to a distance of 6 or 8
inches or more with lightning-like rapidity, and rarely misses its quarry.
Comparing small things with great, the chamæleon's tongue and its action
might be likened to a schoolboy's popgun, having its pellet secured to the
barrel by a long elastic ligament. Presuming further that the pellet is
covered with a viscid secretion such as bird-lime, and that the object shot
at is hit and brought back to the shooter's pocket by virtue of the
ligament's intrinsic elasticity, we have an almost veritable replica of the
chamæleon's fly-catching apparatus. The second remarkable structural
peculiarity of the chamæleon is the independent relationship of the two
eyes. The eyes themselves are unlike those of any other lizards; they are
large, prominent, skin-covered cones, perforated only at their extreme apex
for the minute pupil-opening: while one eye may be fixed on an object in
front of it, the other may be rolling around in search of a second quarry.
This independent capacity of vision, while peculiar among reptiles to the
chamæleon, is common to many fishes, such as blennies and flat-fishes. A
third anomaly in the chamæleon's structure is the character of the feet;
these resemble those of a parrot, the toes being bound together in two
opposable bundles. In the fore foot the inner bundle contains three and the
outer one two toes only, while in the hind foot the order of their
amalgamation is precisely reversed. In either case these feet subserve, as
in parrots and other perching-birds, as most effective organs for
maintaining a close grip upon the tree-branches among which they habitually
live. The tail of the chamæleon is, finally, highly prehensile, and, as
with the New World monkeys, constitutes a veritable fifth hand, wherewith
to ensure it against falling off its perch.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

COMMON CHAMELEON OF SOUTH EUROPE AND NORTH AFRICA.

A minute or more is often occupied by the chamæleon in making a single
forward step.]

The colour-changing properties of the chamæleon have been the subject of
enthusiastic but in many instances exaggerated descriptions from the
earliest times. As a matter of fact there are other lizard species which
share this kaleidoscopic property to an equal or even greater degree. The
Indian tree-geckos, referred to on a previous page, as also the calotes
from the same region, are cases in point. Chamæleons are undoubtedly
possessed of marvellous colour-changing faculties, and it would appear to
be scarcely in all instances, as is more usually represented, a case of
adapting themselves to the tints of their environment. The assumption of
leaf-green, grey, brown, reddish, or yellowish tints, in accordance with
their surroundings, is the ordinary record. Some examples which formed the
subjects of the writer's experiments exhibited, however, interesting
deviations from the beaten track. Male individuals, in particular, were
observed to assume tints and decorative patterns that rendered them
remarkably conspicuous objects, in spite of their leafy environment. The
normal ground-colour of these specimens in full daylight was so dark a
green that it might be almost characterised as black. Upon this were
superimposed lines and spottings of strongly contrasting tints. The more
dominant of these was a brilliant orange, that was distributed in bold
lines along the head and cheeks, and formed a radiating pattern on the
skin-covered eye-cones: The same colour formed somewhat broken-up bars
across all four limbs, and was dispersed in bold spots over the entire
remaining body-surface: along the tail these spots were concentrated in
threes, giving it a semi-barred appearance. All among these orange limb-
and body-spottings were distributed a secondary series of somewhat smaller
spots, the tint of which was a pale but very brilliant emerald-green. This
chamæleon asleep at night was a very different animal. The ground-colour
was transformed from almost black to a bright grass-green. The orange lines
became lighter in colour and broken up into patches; many of the orange
spots on the body disappeared, but those remaining were of larger size and
concentrated in threes in two lines along each side, these triple spots
enclosing centrally a larger elongated spot or patch of bright pink or
puce. The bright emerald-green secondary spots, as seen in daylight, were
almost white. If handled during the daytime, the chamæleon was wont to
assume a colour nearly identical with his night garb; the two lines of pink
patches, previously invisible, would appear, and, while the orange spotting
remained constant, the emerald-green changed to lemon-yellow.

A chamæleon in a rage is a decidedly grotesque object. The back is arched,
the body and more especially the throat-pouch are inflated to their fullest
extent, the mouth is opened, the eyes roll, and the creature rocks itself
to and fro and hisses in a most threatening manner. When, as often happens,
it also simultaneously sits up on its haunches, the effect is doubtless as
terrifying as it is intended to be to a rival chamæleon or any small animal
which may venture to approach it. A number of other lizards, including
tree-climbing varieties, were introduced to the company of the examples
under observation, and until friendly acquaintanceship had been established
their advances towards the chamæleons were always repelled.

The majority of the chamæleons lay eggs, but a small number produce living
young, as with skinks and other lizards. Examples of the common European
and North African species kept by the writer excavated holes in the earth,
in which they laid their eggs, and then carefully covered them up again.
Unfortunately these eggs were not fertilised. One South African species has
been reported to the writer as being in the habit of placing and separately
wrapping and fastening up each egg as deposited in the leaves of the tree
in which it resided. While Africa and Madagascar represent the head centres
of distribution of the fifty odd known species of chamæleons, they enter
Europe through the Spanish Peninsula, and extend eastward to Arabia, India,
and Ceylon. The largest known variety, which inhabits Madagascar, attains a
length of 15 inches; the smallest pygmy chamæleon of the Cape scarcely
measures 2½ inches.


THE TUATERA.

That singular reptile found on certain small islands lying to the
north-east of New Zealand, and known as the TUATERA, differs in so many
structural characters from all other lizards that it is assigned to a
separate order. Externally the tuatera does not differ materially in form
from an ordinary lizard. The skin, however, is peculiar for its leathery,
granulated, and wrinkled texture; there is no trace of external ears; the
eyes, adapted for nocturnal vision, have in daylight vertical pupils; and
the bases of the toes are united by connecting webs. The deeper internal
characteristics include the possession of supplementary so-called abdominal
ribs, the presence of which are readily apprehended on handling the living
animal. These structures, while absent in ordinary lizards, find their near
equivalent in the breastplate of tortoises and turtles. The teeth are not
implanted in distinct sockets, but attached to the summits of the jaws,
which are developed in a beak-like manner, and in older individuals fulfil,
after the manner of a beak, the functions of the worn-out incisor teeth.

Tuateras have been exceedingly scarce of recent years, and in view of their
scientific interest, and the risk of their possible extinction, are now
protected by the New Zealand Government. Among the multitudinous gifts of
which their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales were
recipients during their recently accomplished world-embracing tour, a pair
of living tuatera lizards formed one of the most singular and highly prized
contributions accepted from the loyal New Zealanders.

CHAPTER V.

_SNAKES._


The characteristic contour of a snake's body is too familiar to need
elaborate description; its leading features are, in fact, so nearly
approximated by certain of the legless lizards, previously described, that
the distinctions between the two can with difficulty be defined. Many of
the snake-like lizards, including the Common Blind-worm, are altogether
devoid of external limbs. In some snakes, on the other hand, and notably
the large terrestrial Pythons, a spur-like development on each side of the
base of the tail represents rudimentary hind legs. The Snakes agree
essentially with the Lizards in the character of their scaly covering, the
scales, however, being larger on their under-surface and specially adapted,
as in the legless lizards, for creeping locomotion. The essential
distinctions between the two groups have to be sought in the structure of
the head. The most notable of these, as it obtains in the Snakes, is the
very loose manner in which all the bones connected with the jaws are held
together, thus providing for the greatest possible distension in the act of
their swallowing their prey whole, as is the custom of all ordinary snakes.
To achieve this end, the two halves of the lower jaw are not united
together at their extremity or chin, as in lizards, but are merely
connected with one another by an elastic ligament. In most snakes the bones
of the upper jaw and palate are also attached to one another in a similar
way.

The eyes of a snake differ in a very marked manner from those of ordinary
lizards. No snake possesses movable eyelids. The eye, in compensation, is
protected by a transparent horny disk, continuous with the general
epidermis, and is shed with it when the snake casts its skin. This feature
imparts to snakes that fixed, stony expression of the eyes which
undoubtedly contributes very materially towards increasing the feeling of
repulsion with which snakes are commonly regarded. A few exceptional
lizards, such as the Geckos, have a similar eye-construction, but it is not
met with in any of the limbless or snake-like forms. No snakes, again, show
any trace of external ear-openings, such structures, on the other hand,
being distinctly developed in almost all lizards. The head itself of the
snake is never compressed or elevated, as in most lizards, but flattened
down and usually wider than the body, to which, however, it is united
without a distinct neck. The tongue of the snake is slender, and terminates
in two long, thread-like points; basally it is inserted into a hollow
sheath, into or out of which the entire organ can be retracted or exserted
at will. The somewhat uncanny, flickering action with which a snake, while
moving, displays and as it were feels its way with its long, forked tongue
represents another element which adds to the disfavour with which these
reptiles are commonly regarded. Among the uneducated even at the present
day it is not unusual to hear the tongue, with reference to its peculiar
shape and vibrating action, pronounced to be the seat and instrument of the
animal's poisonous properties. The swift, silent, stealthy, gliding motions
with which, apart from any visible organs of locomotion, a snake slides, as
it were, along the ground and over all obstacles fill to the brink the
measure for its condemnation in the estimation of all but the snake-devotee
or the naturalist.

The locomotion of the snake is, as a matter of fact, one of the most
remarkable and beautifully contrived phenomena in animal mechanics. The
peculiarly jointed and abnormally mobile ribs constitute the mystic _deus
ex machinâ_ by which the reptile accomplishes its migration. These ribs
articulate in pairs by a single mobile head with their respective segment
of the vertebral column. At their opposite extremity they impinge on and
are in muscular connection with the broad, slightly overlapping,
shield-like scales which clothe the under surface of the body. The
rib-muscles, contracting in rhythmical succession, raise the free
overlapping edges of the shield-like scales, which, striking against the
ground in the same regular order, push the body forward. Adopting an easily
comprehensible simile, the snake's body is carried along the ground on the
same principle as a paddle-wheel steamer is pushed along the surface of the
water, the paddle-boards in the case of the snake being affixed to a long,
narrow plane instead of a circular wheel.

DARK GREEN SNAKE.

Closely allied to the rat-snake of India, and preys in a similar manner on
rats, mice, and birds.]

The poison-fangs of snakes are highly specialised structures, and their
presence or otherwise was formerly considered sufficiently distinctive for
the separation of these reptiles into two sharply defined natural series.
More recent investigations have, however, shown that such a system of
classification is entirely artificial, both venomous and harmless species
occurring among groups which are related to one another by essential
structural characters. The teeth in the ordinary or harmless snakes are
usually represented by two rows of slender, recurved, sharply pointed teeth
in the upper jaw, and a single row of a similar character in the lower one.
This recurved character of the dentition effectively assists the snake in
gorging its quarry whole, nothing once seized by the hook-like teeth having
a chance of retreating, the snake itself being unable to eject the prey
upon which the teeth have fastened. In the most poisonous series, such as a
rattle-snake, there is but a single row of recurved teeth in the upper jaw,
and these are the equivalents of the inner set of the harmless species.
Among the most venomous snakes the poison-fangs are tubular in character,
the poison being received from the venom-glands at their open base, and
discharged at the apex. In other forms the fangs have grooved channels only
for the passage of the virus, while in other species there may be an
intermediate condition. In all cases the poison-secreting glands are
modifications of the ordinary salivary glands of other vertebrate animals.
They are situated, one on each side, immediately below and behind the eyes,
and are in some instances so abnormally developed as to extend backwards
along the sides of the body. Special muscles envelop these glands, and
force the poison into the hollow base of the fangs when the mouth is opened
to strike.

members of the class.]

Snakes, like lizards, are most abundant in tropical countries, the Indian
and Malay regions in particular being richest in numbers and varieties. The
British Islands support but three representatives of the class--the ADDER,
the COMMON RINGED and the SMOOTH SNAKES--this number, by a coincidence,
being identical with that of the Lizard Tribe indigenous to the same
islands. Many of the smaller species are little over 1 foot long, while the
huge Pythons and the Anaconda may attain to or exceed 30 feet. Regarding
their habits, some are purely terrestrial, frequenting the rocks or sandy
deserts, or even burrowing beneath the earth's surface. Others are
essentially arboreal, many amphibious, and some, like the Turtles among the
Chelonians, entirely marine. As with the Lizards, the majority of snakes
lay eggs enclosed within a white leathery shell, while with a considerable
number the young are brought forth alive. The eggs, deposited in the earth,
sand, or among vegetable debris, are usually left to be hatched by the heat
of the sun. In the case of the Pythons, however, they are incubated by the
parent.

BOA-CONSTRICTOR READY TO STRIKE.

The neck, thrown back in one or more loops, can be projected, with immense
force and lightning-like rapidity, to strike or seize an intended victim.]

A small group of snakes which is usually placed at the head of the series
in systematic classifications share the subterranean habits of the
Amphisbænas among the Lizards; and the eyes being rudimentary and
functionless, they are commonly known as BLIND-SNAKES. A structural
peculiarity which separates these singular reptiles from all other members
of the Snake Tribe is the entire absence of teeth from either the upper or
lower jaw. The food of the blind-snakes consists largely of ants and the
larvæ of beetles and other insects which lead a subterranean life. Although
spending the greater portion of their existence underground, they
occasionally come out upon the surface, such migrations more generally
taking place during showery weather. About 100 species of blind-snakes are
known, and are mostly confined to tropical countries. One small worm-like
form occurs in Greece and the adjacent islands, its range extending through
a considerable area of South-western Asia.

The step from the small worm-like Blind-snakes, with their functionless
eyes and underground habits, to the Boas and Pythons, the largest and most
highly organised members of the Serpent Tribe, would seem at first sight to
be altogether unwarranted. In one essential character, however, they agree
very remarkably. In both groups the bony skeleton exhibits a far more
generalised structural plan than in any of the succeeding ones, so that
they may be regarded as more nearly resembling the primitive stock from
which the other more specialised kinds--such as the Vipers, with their
death-dealing poison-fangs--have been evolved.

The PYTHONS and BOAS, or BOA-CONSTRICTORS, as they are popularly known,
belong entirely to the non-venomous section of the Snake series. The teeth,
forming two rows in the upper jaws, gradually decrease in size from before
backwards, and none of them are grooved or modified in the form of
poison-fangs. The body is usually more or less compressed, and the tail
prehensile. The TYPICAL PYTHONS, or ROCK-SNAKES, as they are called, with
reference to their rock-frequenting habits, are distributed throughout
South-eastern Asia, Australia, and Central and South Africa.

[Illustration: _Photo by D. Le Souef_]     [_Melbourne._

CARPET-SNAKE.

So called with reference to the variegated carpet-like pattern of its
skin-ornamentation.]

The INDIAN PYTHON, which is the largest Old World representative of its
race, is known authentically to attain to a length of 30 feet, and in the
largest specimens the spinal column may include over 400 vertebræ. In
common with other members of its family, this huge snake kills its quarry
by compression or strangulation, throwing around it successive coils of its
body, which, with their contraction, crush out the life of the victim. The
dispatched prey is then swallowed whole, commencing with the head. The
previous crushing of the bony framework greatly assists the swallowing
process, which is further aided by the snake pouring over the body of its
victim a copious discharge of saliva.

The extent to which the jaws and the integument of the body generally can
be distended for the passage and reception of the food is remarkable. After
partaking of a solid meal in this fashion, pythons remain sluggish and in a
state of semi-torpor for several days, not reawakening to active life, in
fact, until the digestion of the food has been accomplished. As is well
known, these and other snakes can exist for periods of many months'
duration between their meals. One of the largest Indian pythons by no means
contents itself with such small quarry as hares and rabbits--sheep, young
calves, and some of the smaller deer representing its more accustomed food.
The human species unarmed is as weak or weaker than the proverbial kitten,
pitted against the hydraulic-press-like embrace of these monster serpents;
and many an Indian native, and more rarely the white man, has fallen a
victim to their attacks.

The RETICULATED PYTHON, so called on account of the bold reticulated
pattern of the skin-ornamentation, may equal, if not exceed, the Indian
species in dimensions. It is a native of Burma, Siam, and the Malay region
generally, and is recorded as occasionally exceeding 30 feet in length.
Examples of this species, including one over 20 feet long, have constituted
leading attractions at the Reptile-house in the Zoological Society's
Gardens for many years past. The gorgeous prismatic tints that play upon
the surface-markings of the coils of these huge snakes, as the sun strikes
upon them about midday in their cages, form one of the most wonderful
sights that the Gardens afford.

The African Continent also produces its large species of pythons. One of
these, attaining to a length of 20 feet or more, reaches its maximum on the
west coast, and occurs with local modifications as far east and south as
Natal. In the latter country it is most familiarly known as the NATAL
ROCK-SNAKE.

Some rather singular incidents have been recorded illustrating the tenacity
with which pythons retain hold of the quarry once seized, or, more
correctly, their inability to release it. At the Adelaide Zoological
Gardens a specimen, when absorbing a rabbit, managed to entangle its teeth
in a corner of its blanket. That blanket had to follow the rodent through
the 12-foot-long python. On another occasion two pythons, a Queenslander
and Afrikander, happened at the same instant to commandeer respectively the
head and hindquarters of an identical rabbit. Inch by inch the portion
between the two grew smaller until the two noses met. There was no
retreating from this _impasse_, and the momentous question, "Shall I slay
my brother boa?" had to be settled affirmatively by one or other of the
interested parties without further parley. The somewhat smaller and weaker
individual was gradually telescoped, and in due time assimilated. The
absorber was decidedly poorly and "off colour" for a considerable period
after accomplishing this cannibalistic feat; it ultimately recovered both
its appetite and its prismatic tints.

The TRUE BOAS, as distinguished from the Pythons, are more essentially
arboreal in their habits, and, with the exception of one or two species
found in Madagascar, belong to the tropical American zoological region. The
COMMON BOA, or BOA-CONSTRICTOR, which attains to a length of 12 or 14 feet
or more, is limited in its distribution to South America. The colours of
this snake, which consist mainly of a light brown, with a number of dark
brown cross-bars on the back, and light centred, dark brown spots on the
sides, so nearly agree with the tint of the tree-branches with their
interlacing shadows, among which it usually lies concealed, that,
notwithstanding its large size, it readily evades detection, and is
unconsciously approached by the animals on which it preys. These, in adult
individuals, may be represented by such large-sized quarry as dogs, and
even deer; while smaller examples prey largely on birds and their eggs, and
the numerous rodents with which the tropical American forests teem. From
observations made upon this species in captivity, it would appear that the
eggs are usually hatched within the parent's body, though an instance has
been recorded in which both eggs and young were produced simultaneously.

A close ally of the typical boas, which shares with them a tropical South
American habitat, is the huge ANACONDA, or WATER-BOA, of Brazil and the
adjacent countries. This animal, which is undoubtedly the largest living
representative of the Serpent Tribe, attains a length little, if any, short
of 40 feet. One such monster was specially referred to by Dr. Gardiner, the
botanist, in his "Travels in Brazil"; it had devoured a horse, and was
found dead, entangled in the branches of a tree overhanging a river, into
which it had been carried by a flood. Full-grown cattle, and occasionally
human beings, as well as horses, are alleged to fall victims to the
destructive prowess of this gigantic snake. The anaconda is essentially
amphibious in its habits, the greater part of its life being spent in the
water, lying in wait, in the quiet lagoons and backwaters, with only its
head above the surface, and prepared to seize any unfortunate animal which
may come to the brink to drink. At other times it will coil itself upon the
trunks and larger branches of the adjacent trees, and from that point of
vantage will dart down its head, with sure aim and lightning rapidity, to
seize any suitable quarry which may pass beneath. In some parts of South
America where the rivers dry up at certain seasons of the year, the
anaconda is recorded to be in the habit of burying itself in the mud and
lying torpid, after the manner of crocodiles, until the return of the
rains. The ground-colour of the anaconda is usually greyish brown or olive
above, the back being ornamented with one or two transversely disposed rows
of large, rounded, dark brown or blackish spots, while the sides are
decorated with more irregularly scattered, smaller, eye-like spots, having
whitish centres and dark margins.

An interesting little group, connecting the Boas and Pythons with the
Common Snakes, is that of the so-called SHIELD-TAILS, or EARTH-SNAKES, of
India and Ceylon. These reptiles are earth-burrowers, like the
Blind-snakes, previously referred to, but have well-developed eyes, and are
further distinguished by the abruptly truncated contour of their posterior
extremity, which may be either a naked disk or covered with keeled scales.
Their bodies are cylindrical, with the scaly covering very smooth and
polished, the scales of the under-surface being but little larger than the
upper ones; the jaws, in conformity with the peculiar modification of their
skull, are not capable of wide distension. Seven genera and a large number
of species are recognised, some being brilliantly coloured with tints of
red or yellow. Their main diet is earth-worms.

The family of the COMMON SNAKES includes the greater number of species, the
majority of the most venomous as well as harmless varieties being comprised
within its limits. The characters that are made the basis for separating
these snakes from the Boas are associated with the structure of the skull,
and are not therefore readily recognised without having recourse to
dissection. It will suffice to mention that, in this and the remaining
groups, there is an entire absence from the lower jaw of the slender
supplementary bone known as the "coronoid," which is present in the Boas
and Pythons. From succeeding groups, such as the Viperine series, they are
distinguished by the circumstance that the upper jaw is firmly fixed in a
horizontal position, and is not capable of erection in a vertical plane, or
like the lid of a box, as obtains with the Vipers.

[Illustration: _By permission of the New York Zoological Society._

PINE-SNAKE.

A tree-haunting American species with very bold markings.]

These snakes are separated into secondary groups with relation to the
structure of their teeth. In one series these teeth are solid throughout,
neither grooved nor tubular; and all the snakes thus characterised are
harmless. In the second series one or more pairs of the hinder upper teeth
are longitudinally grooved, and act as poison-fangs; they are consequently
distinguished as the "back-fanged" group. In the third series the front
teeth of the upper jaw-bone are grooved, and constitute the poison-fangs,
and they are known as the "front-fanged" group.

To the first-mentioned solid-toothed and harmless division of the family
belongs the BRITISH RINGED SNAKE and some forty other allied species which
are collectively known as WATER-SNAKES, with reference to their more or
less pronounced aquatic habits. The ringed snake has a stoutish cylindrical
body, keeled scales, flat head covered with regular shields, wide
mouth-cleft, and numerous teeth, the strongest of which are at the hinder
end of the jaw-bone. The colour varies somewhat, being usually grey, brown,
or olive above, with darker spots or narrow transverse bands; the
under-surface is mottled black and white or grey. The lip-shields are white
or yellowish, with black dividing-lines. The neck in the ordinary variety
is usually ornamented with a yellow, white, or orange collar-like patch,
behind which is a somewhat broader black collar, which is produced forwards
and sub-divides the yellow one in the centre of the upper-surface. In the
variety of the ringed snake indigenous to the South of Europe the
collar-like markings may be altogether absent, or reduced to a small black
patch on each side of the nape of the neck. The maximum length of the
ringed snake is some 6½ feet. It is a most expert swimmer, moving swiftly
through the water with lateral undulations of its body, and carrying its
head and neck well above the surface. Frogs constitute its favourite diet,
but it will also capture and devour fish, mice, and young birds.

The VIPERINE and TESSELATED SNAKES, both European forms, as also the
GARTER- and MOCASSIN-SNAKES of North America, are all closely allied in
structure and habits to the familiar ringed species. The second British
species, known as the SMOOTH SNAKE, belongs to the same group, but is more
terrestrial in its habits; while comparatively rare in England, and limited
to the southern counties, it is plentiful on the Continent. The INDIAN
RAT-SNAKE, which is almost as useful as the domestic cat in ridding
dwellings of rats and mice, is another representative of the solid-toothed
group. This group also includes the so-called PYGMY SNAKES, inhabiting the
Malay region, whose habits are mainly arboreal. They are the most
diminutive members of their order, some of the thirty known species not
exceeding 1 foot in length.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

QUEENSLAND SEA-SNAKE.

Sea-snakes have compressed tails, which they use for steering.]

The typical TREE-SNAKES of the Indian and Australian region, with large
eyes, somewhat compressed bodies, and colours of green or olive, in
harmonious accord with their arboreal surroundings, also belong to the
solid-toothed and harmless section. An especially interesting
representative of this group is the so-called EGG-EATING SNAKE of South
Africa. It does not exceed 2 feet in length, and is for the most part
arboreal in its habits, and, as its name implies, would appear to feed
exclusively on eggs. As a structural adaptation for this peculiar habit,
the spinous processes of a number of the vertebræ project into the throat
and are tipped with enamel, thus constituting supplementary throat-teeth.
Normally this snake subsists on the eggs of the smaller birds, but when
short of this supply has been known to leave the trees and rob hen-roosts,
being able, notwithstanding its comparatively small size, to dilate its
mouth and throat for the reception of a hen's egg. The egg is split
longitudinally by the action of the throat-teeth, the contents swallowed,
and the shell ejected.

The second or "back-fanged" group includes many exceedingly poisonous
species. Among these may be mentioned the INDIAN WHIP-SNAKES and their
allies, comprising many tree-frequenting species, closely resembling in
habits and colours the harmless solid-toothed tree-snakes of the preceding
section.

ENGLISH VIPER.

The only British venomous reptile.]

It is among the third or "front-fanged" group, however, that the most
venomous species occur. To this section belongs the death-dealing COBRA,
the yet more formidable HAMADRYAD, the INDIAN CRAITS, the EGYPTIAN ASP, and
the AUSTRALIAN BLACK SNAKES and DEATH-ADDERS. The COBRA-DE-CAPELLO, HOODED,
or SPECTACLED SNAKE, as it is variously known, is perhaps the most
notoriously familiar example of its section, being responsible for the
greater moiety of the many thousands of fatalities that annually occur
among the natives of India from the bites of venomous serpents. The craits,
which resemble the cobras, but do not possess an erectile hood, are
accredited a second position in death-dealing. The peculiar feature of the
erectile hood that characterises the cobras is due to the circumstance that
a certain number of the ribs in this region are independently movable, and
can be elevated and depressed at will, the skin-fold that overlies them
being loose and elastic. The back of the hood in the ordinary Indian cobra
is usually ornamented with two eye-like spots, connected with a loop-like
band, which communicate to the complete pattern the fancied resemblance to
a pair of spectacles, whence it has derived its appellation of Spectacled
Snake. Individuals vary, however, very considerably in this matter of
colour-markings; in some instances a single eye-like spot is alone
developed, while in others it may be entirely absent. The COMMON COBRA
grows to a length of 6 or 7 feet, dimensions greatly exceeded by the GIANT
COBRA, or HAMADRYAD, a fortunately rarer form more exclusively confined to
jungle and forest districts. This species may attain to a length of 13 feet
or more, and on account of its deadly bite and fiercely aggressive
disposition is much feared by the natives of the countries it inhabits,
which include not only India, but Burma, Siam, and the Malay region. This
giant cobra preys almost exclusively on smaller snakes, frequently
including the common cobra.

A third species of cobra, known as the HAJÉ, or SPITTING-SNAKE, inhabits
Africa, from Egypt as far south as Natal. It is perhaps the fiercest member
of the group, turning readily upon its pursuers, or even commencing the
attack. It also possesses the somewhat remarkable and disconcerting habit
of ejecting poison from its mouth to a distance of several feet, usually
aiming with considerable accuracy at the eyes of its assailant. Although
unattended by permanently serious effects, the pain caused by the virus
striking the eyes is for the time being excruciatingly painful, placing the
recipient of the unwelcome discharge entirely _hors de combat_. The first
record of the poison-spitting propensities of this snake, made by Mr.
Gordon Cumming, was received with considerable incredulity, but the
statement has been confirmed. A relative of the writer's, stationed in
Natal, was recently the victim of such an incident, receiving the
poison-discharge in his eyes from one of these snakes, which, in his
eagerness to dispatch it, he had imprudently cornered, armed only with a
sword. It was some days before the pain entirely abated and the sight
regained its normal clearness.

Australia, with its BLACK and TIGER-SNAKES and the DEATH-ADDER, possesses
snakes as venomous as the cobra, which the first-named species approach in
their capacity to inflate their necks, though to a less degree. The
TASMANIAN BLACK SNAKE, as it glides swiftly, as though sailing, across open
grass-land, with the midday sun scintillating on its 7-foot stretch of
jet-black, highly polished scales, its head and expanded neck threateningly
elevated some 18 inches above the ground, is certainly a most impressive
sight.

One very distinct group of the front-fanged section which demands brief
notice is that of the SEA-SNAKES. These are readily distinguished by their
especial adaptation to a marine existence, their much-compressed, oar-like
tails constituting powerful propelling organs. In contradistinction to the
terrestrial snakes of the same group, the inferior scales, not being
required for terrestrial locomotion, are little if any larger than the
upper ones. All the species are highly venomous; they feed chiefly upon
fish, and are distributed throughout the tropical seas. The larger species
rarely exceed 5 or 6 feet in length, and the majority are much smaller.
Many species are noted for their conspicuous colouring, which most
frequently takes the form of distinctly contrasting bands. All the members
of this group are viviparous.

RATTLE-SNAKE.

The rattle-snake is pre-eminently noted for its power of fascinating birds
and the smaller mammals.]

The last and most highly specialised section of the Snake Tribe is that of
the VIPER and its allies, collectively known as the Viperine Family. In all
the representatives of this group the hinder upper jaw-bone is so loosely
articulated that it is capable of erection at a right angle to the
horizontal plane of the skull, the gape of the mouth being in consequence
abnormally wide. The teeth in the upper jaw are reduced to a single
anteriorly situated pair of tubular poison-fangs, with which, when striking
its prey, the snake deals a direct stab. The head in the majority of the
Viperine Snakes is flattened and triangular, nearly resembling in contour
the symbolic ace of spades. The body is usually relatively thick, and the
tail short and stumpy. The vertical pupil of the eye denotes nocturnal
habits. All the members of the section are venomous.

The Viperine Snakes are usually divided into two groups. The first contains
the Typical or Old World Vipers, and includes, in addition to the COMMON
VIPER, the CERASTES or HORNED VIPER of Egypt, and the large and most
repulsive and deadly African PUFF-ADDER. The COMMON VIPER or ADDER, the
only poisonous British snake, has a very extensive geographical
distribution, extending throughout Europe and Asia as far east as the
island of Saghalien, and northwards to the Arctic Circle. The HORNED VIPER
of the Sahara and North Africa is one of the most venomous of living
serpents. Lying buried beneath the sand, with only its head above, it will
spring aggressively at any animal which passes by, and the action of its
venom is so rapid that a horse or man bitten by it usually dies within half
an hour. In colour the horned viper closely resembles the sand or stony
wastes among which it lies. The most remarkable feature in this snake is
the presence of two elevated horn-like processes immediately above the
eyes, which are most prominent in the male. The species has frequently been
on view at the Zoological Society's Gardens. On one occasion an ostensible
example was purchased and deposited in the Reptile-house, which proved on
nearer investigation to be a base imposition. A common desert-viper had
been cleverly manipulated by the deft insertion of suitably shaped
splinters of wood into its head, so that it resembled the rarer horned
variety. The PUFF-ADDER, the largest member of its tribe, may attain to a
length of 6 feet or more, and is distributed throughout the African
Continent. Its thick body is almost triangular in section, the head very
large, flat, and bluntly rounded anteriorly, while the eyes have a
particularly fierce, stony, and repulsive aspect. In colour individuals
vary considerably, but there is generally a chequered pattern of reds,
browns, and greys, disposed in the form of darker and lighter alternating
crescent-shaped bands along the back. The poison of this snake is nearly as
virulent as that of the horned viper, and is commonly used by the African
bushmen for poisoning their arrows.

The Viperine group is abundantly represented in the New World, where its
members differ from the typical Old World species in sundry anatomical
points, one of the most conspicuous features being the presence of a
distinct depression or pit in the surface of the head between the nostril
and the eye on either side. On this account they are distinguished by the
title of PIT-VIPERS. Among the more familiar representatives of this group
are the RATTLE-SNAKES, the FER-DE-LANCE, the BUSH-MASTER, and the
COPPER-HEAD or MOCASSIN-SNAKES. All these are notoriously venomous, fatal
effects from bites received by human subjects being of frequent recurrence.
The RATTLE-SNAKES are especially distinguished by the peculiar, loosely
jointed, horny appendage to their tails, by the rapid vibration of which,
when disturbed, they fortunately give timely notice of their presence. In
the young individuals this rattle is only represented by a single
button-like knob, additional loose, hollow, horny rings being added between
it and the scaly termination of the tail as age increases. In full-grown
examples the horny rings composing the rattle may number as many as twenty
or more, though, owing to the war of extermination incessantly levied
against these reptiles in all civilised areas, it is rarely that such
elaborate rattle-bearers are now met with. The rattle-snake, in the more
northern districts of its distribution, hibernates in the winter, often
congregating together in great numbers for the sake of the mutual warmth.
In the earlier days certain caves were famous as the retreats into which
not only hundreds but thousands of the reptiles would congregate from the
country round for their winter's slumber. At such times hunting-parties
were specially organised for their wholesale destruction, and accomplished
much towards reducing their ranks to their present numbers.

FER-DE-LANCE SNAKE.

One of the fiercest and most venomous of American viperine snakes.]

In addition to the common North American rattle-snake there are some four
or five other species distributed throughout the Southern States, Mexico,
and Panama. None appear to exceed a length of 6 feet. In South America
their place is to a large extent taken by the so-called BUSH-MASTER, a
snake which attains to a length of as much as from 9 to 12 feet, and, in
addition to being exceedingly venomous, is of an especially fierce and
aggressive disposition. It is devoid of a rattle-like appendage, the tail
terminating in a sharp horny spine. The FER-DE-LANCE, or RAT-TAILED
PIT-VIPER, is another Central and South American species, held in wholesome
dread on account of its death-dealing potentialities. The South American
sugar-plantations are an especially favourite resort of this deadly snake,
its attraction being the rats which frequent the canes and afford its chief
food. Lying concealed among the thick foliage, it will launch itself
aggressively at any passer-by, and its bite is usually attended with fatal
results within a few hours. The fer-de-lance grows to a length of 6 or 7 or
occasionally even 8 feet, with a thickness of a man's arm. Its colours, as
with most members of its tribe, are somewhat variable. The ground-colour of
the back is usually olive or reddish brown, with dark cross-bands; a black
stripe runs backwards from the eye to the neck, and in some instances the
sides of the body are bright red.

BULL-FROG.

The croaking of this species may be heard at a distance of several miles.]

The American Continent is not wanting in aquatic representatives of the
Viperine series. The most notable of these is the fish-eating WATER-VIPER,
whose distribution extends from North Carolina in the south over the whole
of North America as far westward as the Rocky Mountains. Fish and frogs
constitute the main diet of this reptile.

AMERICAN BULL-FROG.

Young ducks are a favourite food of this voracious Batrachian.]

The Amphibian Class, through the Newts and Salamanders more especially,
would appear at first sight to have much in common with and to be most
closely allied to the Lizards, previously described. As a matter of fact,
however, the group is much more nearly related to the Fishes. Quite the
most characteristic feature in the Amphibians that is indicative of the
above-mentioned affinity is the circumstance that for a more or less longer
period of their existence their respiratory organs take the form of
external gills, structures not found in any of the preceding vertebrate
classes. Another diagnostic character of the Amphibia is afforded by the
circumstance that they all pass through a transitional or larval condition
before arriving at the adult state. The familiar tadpole phase of the
common frog or toad typically illustrates this point. During its earliest
larval state the fish-like resemblance is especially conspicuous. In
addition to possessing gills, the body is limbless, and produced into a
long fish-like tail, having superior and inferior fin-like membranes, with
which the little animal propels itself through the water. These locomotive
fins, however, are never furnished with supporting fin-rays, as obtains
among the Fishes. In contradistinction to the Lizards and Snakes, the skin
of Amphibians is never covered with spines or scales, but is soft and
naked. In many of the Toads and Salamanders the surface of the skin is,
however, warted and highly glandular, and capable of emitting an acrid and
sometimes poisonous fluid. More or less pronounced conditions of moisture
are essential for the well-being of all Amphibians. The eggs are deposited,
and the earlier or larval conditions, with but few exceptions, passed, in
the water, while the adults remain in its near proximity, and frequently
take up their abode in it. Amphibia do not, however, drink water after the
manner of lizards and other reptiles, but absorb all the moisture they
require through the surface of their skins. The deeper and more essential
skeletal elements of the Amphibia differ conspicuously from those of the
preceding groups. The vertebræ in the permanently gill-bearing species more
particularly are scarcely to be distinguished from those of fishes. In the
Frog and Toad Tribe, on the other hand, they are reduced to a less number,
seven or eight only, than is found among any other vertebrates, while ribs
do not exist or are rudimentary and functionless throughout the class. Many
bones of the skull in the Amphibia, as well as its general construction,
are more in accord with those of fishes than of ordinary reptiles. The
tongue, not always present, is attached immediately inside the front of the
lower jaw, its tip pointing down the animal's throat. It is remarkable
that, notwithstanding their aquatic proclivities, no Amphibian has been
discovered which frequents salt water.

EDIBLE FROG.

TIGER-LIKE FROG.

A species closely allied to the common British frog, but more boldly
marked.]

Amphibians amongst themselves constitute two very easily recognised
sub-divisions,--the one including the Frogs and Toads, collectively forming
the Tailless group; and the other represented by the Newts and Salamanders,
or Tailed Amphibians. The former group has an almost world-wide
distribution, numbering some thousand species; it is most abundantly
represented in the tropics, ranging thence in diminishing numbers to the
limits of the Arctic Circle. In colder climates these Amphibia usually
hibernate during the winter months; while in tropical countries, where dry
seasons intervene, they often bury themselves in the mud, and remain in a
state of torpor till the return of the rains. The majority are more or less
essentially nocturnal in their habits. Frogs and toads commence life in an
aquatic tadpole phase. While in the adult state they are strictly
carnivorous, the tadpoles are vegetarian feeders.

The section to which the COMMON BRITISH FROG belongs includes nearly 150
species, collectively known as Water-frogs, which present considerable
differences in both their aspect and habits. While some are perennially
aquatic, others only resort to the water during the breeding-season; some
are terrestrial and occasionally earth-burrowers, while yet another series
is essentially arboreal.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

RÖNTGEN RAY PHOTOGRAPH OF COMMON FROG.

The relatively small amount of bone which enters into the structure of the
skull is well shown in this photograph.]

In addition to the familiar British species the much-esteemed EDIBLE FROG
of the Continent has become acclimatised in England. A dark-coloured race
of this frog, supposed to have been introduced by the monks centuries since
on account of its esculent properties, is plentiful in the fens of
Cambridgeshire, while a greener race of the same species was imported to
and established in Norfolk somewhere about the year 1840. The edible frog
may be distinguished from the common species by the more complete webbing
of its hind feet, the absence of the dark so-called temporal spot that
extends from the eye to the shoulder, and the presence in the males of a
globular sac on each side of the head, which confers upon them louder
croaking powers than are possessed by the common species.

The loudest-voiced as well as almost the largest member of this group is
the BULL-FROG of Canada and the United States. The length of the body in
this species may be as much as from 7 to 7½ inches, exclusive of the legs;
and its croakings, or more correctly bellowings, are so loud that it may be
heard for a distance of several miles. These croakings are most pronounced
during the early spring or breeding-season. In the Southern United States,
however, they are maintained more or less persistently throughout the year.
While the British frog contents itself with a diet of slugs, worms,
beetles, and other insects, the bull-frog aspires to larger quarry, and has
an especial penchant for young ducklings. As a compensation the flesh of
the bull-frog is said to be very delicately flavoured, and the species is
so much esteemed in some localities as to be kept in captivity and fattened
for the table. It has been recorded that the bull-frog makes leaps of from
8 to 10 feet in length and 5 feet in height.

In point of size the bull-frog is somewhat eclipsed by a species discovered
in the Solomon Islands, and known as GUPPY'S FROG. This huge frog has a
body no less than 9 inches in length. It has not been recorded whether its
vocal powers are proportionately loud. Another large species allied to the
Bull-frogs is found in South and East Africa, whose flesh is attested to by
Dr. Livingstone as being excellent eating and resembling chicken when
cooked. This frog, known to the natives as the MATLAMITLO, is supposed by
them to fall from the clouds, on account of its sudden appearance in even
the driest parts of the desert immediately after a thunder-storm. The
species, however, is in the habit of making holes at the roots of bushes,
into which it retires during the months of drought, rushing out into the
hollows filled by the thunder-showers while the rain is still actually
falling. Even during the long drought these frogs continue their croakings
from their retreats at night, and are very misleading to travellers, who
customarily associate their presence with the immediate neighbourhood of
water.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

ORNAMENTED HORNED TOAD.

The bite of this toad is highly venomous.]

There is a remarkable difference in the voice-timbre of the various species
of frogs. In England, with its one indigenous variety, comparisons cannot
be instituted. In countries, however, like Australia, where numbers of
species live in close proximity, the phenomenon is very marked. Some only
give voice in the evening or night, while others keep up their clamour
throughout the day; with some the note is metallic and almost bell-like,
while one diurnal croaking species, which congregates in great numbers in
the eastern Tasmanian coast district, emits a loud percussive note closely
resembling that of a stone-breaker's hammer. On several occasions, in fact,
when driving through the areas these frogs frequented, the impression
produced by their croaking was so realistic that the next turn in the road
was expected to reveal the presence of a large gang of road-makers engaged
in negotiating a wayside stone-heap.

One of the most remarkable species is the FLYING-FROG of Java. The power of
flight is simulated in this instance on a different principle to that which
obtains in any other group. It is not accomplished through the medium of
abnormally produced ribs with connecting membrane, as occurs in the
Flying-lizards; nor by means of a flap of skin stretched between the fore
and hind limbs, as in the Flying-squirrels and Phalangers. In place of
these the toes of all four feet are abnormally prolonged, and their
interspaces bridged over to their tips by webbing. The body of this frog is
about 4 inches long, while the webs of the feet, when fully expanded, cover
collectively an area of fully 12 square inches; they thus constitute aerial
floats, which enable their owner to make prodigiously long flying leaps
among the trees in which it takes up its abode. The colours of this
singular species are striking; the back and limbs are a deep shining green,
the under-surface and inner toes yellow, and the webs black rayed with
yellow. In common with the typical Tree-frogs, the toes of this Javan
flying variety all terminate in a dilated adhesive disk.

ORNAMENTED HORNED TOAD.

Is accustomed to prowl round farmyards to pick up stray chicks and

Among the oddities of the Frog Tribe prominence may be given to the
singular SHORT-HEADED FROGS of East Africa. In these the head is so short,
and the body, when puffed out, so nearly globular, that they have been
aptly described as more nearly resembling india-rubber balls than frogs.
Another notable form, inhabiting Chili, is remarkable for the circumstance
that the throat-sac of the male is so enlarged and modified as to form a
chamber on the under surface of the body. In this sac the eggs laid by the
female are deposited and pass through their tadpole phases.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

EUROPEAN GREEN TREE-FROG.

Indigenous to Southern Europe.]

The HORNED FROGS, or HORNED TOADS, of South America constitute a distinct
and interesting group. They are of large size, stout and rotund, gorgeously
apparelled, and truculent in bearing. There are nearly a dozen known
species, the distinctive feature from which they take their name having
reference to the stiff, horn-like development of their upper eyelids. The
largest species is a native of Brazil, whose body may be as much as 8
inches long. This species has the horn-like processes of the eyelids most
prominently developed. A somewhat smaller but conspicuously handsome
species, plentiful in the Argentine Republic, is at the present time
represented by several individuals at the Regent's Park Gardens. In this
animal the body is relatively more obese and toad-like than in the
Brazilian form, but the horn-like angle of the upper eyelid is only
slightly produced. The colours vary somewhat, the general ground-tint of
the upper-surface is bronze-green or yellow, upon which are distributed
large spots and blotches of dark olive or chocolate, having light yellow or
golden margins. The spots on the limbs are the widest, and almost take the
character of cross-bands. Bright claret-red lines are sometimes developed
in and among the body-spots.

A very interesting account of the habits of this frog appears in Mr. W. H.
Hudson's "The Naturalist in La Plata." Mr. Hudson reports it as being
common on the pampas as far south as the Rio Colorado, in Patagonia. In the
breeding-season it congregates in pools, and displays extraordinary vocal
powers, which are exercised at night. The notes uttered are long,
resembling those of a wind instrument, and are so powerful that on still
evenings they may be heard distinctly a mile off. After the pairing-season
the frogs disperse, and, retiring to moist places, bury themselves just
deep enough to leave their broad green backs on a level with the surface.
The eyes, under these conditions, look out as from a couple of
watch-towers, and are on the _qui vive_ for any approaching prey. This
consists of any moving creature which they can capture, such as other frogs
and toads, birds, and small mammals. In very wet seasons they will frequent
the neighbourhood of houses, and lie in wait for chickens and ducklings,
often capturing and attempting to swallow objects much too large for them.
In disposition they are exceedingly pugnacious, savagely biting at anything
that comes near them. When teased, the creature swells itself out to such
an extent that one expects to see it burst. It follows its tormentors about
with slow, awkward leaps, its vast mouth wide open, and uttering an
incessant harsh croaking sound. When they bite, these frogs hold on with
the tenacity of a bull-dog, poisoning the blood of the creature seized with
their glandular secretion. Mr. Hudson records two instances in which to his
knowledge horses were killed through being bitten by a horned frog. One of
them, while lying down, had been seized by a fold in the skin near the
belly; the other had been grasped by the nose while cropping grass. In both
instances the vicious frog was found dead, with jaws tightly closed, still
hanging to the dead horse. "It would seem," Mr. Hudson remarks, "that they
are sometimes incapable of letting go at will, and, like honey-bees,
destroy themselves in these savage attacks."

The TREE-FROGS represent one of the most distinct groups of the tribe. All
its members are more or less arboreal in their habits, repairing to the
water only during the breeding-season, or leaving the trees to seek shelter
in the earth or underneath stones or timber for the purposes of
hibernation. As an adaptation for their special habits, the toes of the
tree-frogs are provided at their tips with suctorial disks, so that they
can walk on perpendicular or smoothly glazed surfaces after the manner of
the Geckos among the Lizards. Another characteristic feature is the
development on the under surface of their bodies of peculiar granular
glands pierced by numerous pores, through the medium of which they rapidly
absorb the moisture deposited by dew or rain on the surfaces of the leaves
among which they live. The colours of the tree-frogs harmonise, as a rule,
so completely with those of their leafy environments that their presence
very readily escapes detection. Many of the species, moreover, rival the
chamæleon in their capacity of quickly adapting their tints to that of a
newly occupied surrounding. Green is naturally the dominant ground-tint of
these frogs. Often, however, it is intermixed with stripes and bands of
other colours, while sometimes the green hue is entirely replaced, as in
the BLUE or BICOLOURED TREE-FROG of South America, which is brilliant azure
above and pure white beneath. A very beautiful Australian species, abundant
in Tasmania and Victoria, and appropriately named the GOLDEN TREE-FROG, has
its grass-green overcoat thickly overlaid and embroidered with, as it were,
the purest beaten gold.

COMMON TOAD.

Toads are accredited with attaining an age of several hundred years.]

One small species of tree-frog is common on the European Continent, its
distribution extending to North Africa and eastward throughout Asia north
of the Himalaya to Japan. The species is imported into England in
considerable numbers, and readily becomes acclimatised in a conservatory.
Green above and whitish beneath constitute the prevailing tints of this
species, such uniformity being, however, varied by the presence of a
darker, often nearly black, light-edged streak, that extends from the snout
through the eye and ear along each side of the body, and sends a branch
upwards and forwards on the loins. The male of this European species shares
with many others of its tribe the possession of a large external vocal sac,
which when inflated bulges out from the throat in a spherical form to
dimensions little inferior to those of the creature's body. It may be
observed of examples of these frogs acclimatised in a conservatory that the
falling of heavy rain on the roof is an almost certain incentive to their
croakings. By pouring water resonantly from a little height into another
vessel, the writer also found that he could produce a frog chorus at
command.

The European and other tree-frogs deposit their eggs in the water, some
species constructing a symmetrical crater-like nest of mud for the
reception of the eggs and tadpoles. Certain kinds, however, never leave the
trees, having adapted their requirements to the naturally provided
environments. Thus one Brazilian species deposits its eggs in the water
almost invariably contained in the central cup of a tree, while another
allied frog chooses for the same purpose the moist interstices at the bases
of decaying banana leaves. A step further, resulting in complete
independence of external water, is arrived at by the MARSUPIAL or POUCHED
TREE-FROG of Central America. In this species the female develops a
capacious pouch on her back, which opens backward, and wherein both the
eggs--primarily assisted to their position by the male--and tadpoles
undergo their characteristic transformations.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

COMMON TOAD.

The toad is highly appreciated by the horticulturist on account of its
utility in destroying insect-pests.]

As a contrast to the foregoing exclusively tree-dwelling forms, one very
fine species common in Queensland has pronounced social proclivities. He is
a fine fellow, with a bright pea-green coat and large, lustrous black eyes,
and either with or without your leave invades your bedroom from the
adjoining verandah, and makes the lip of your water-jug his headquarters.
Here he will "lie low" the livelong day. With the approach of night,
however, this lethargy is thrown aside, and he hops forth, making
excursions through every room in search of black-beetles, spiders, moths,
or other acceptable quarry. In this vermin-destroying capacity he is a
welcome guest to all except perhaps the ultra-squeamish housekeeper, his
occasional offence of an upset glass or cup during his excited chase of the
wily cockroach being readily condoned. He has a playful habit too, during
his midnight wanderings, of climbing up walls and ceilings, to which he
readily clings with his adhesive toes, and mayhap drops down on the
recumbent form of some peaceful sleeper, who, if a stranger, possibly wakes
with an alarming apprehension of snakes or other uncanny intruders. When
once this QUEENSLAND GREEN FROG has determined upon his camping-ground, he
clings to it with remarkable pertinacity. You may deport him time after
time, and even carry him half a day's journey into the wilderness, but he
turns up again the next morning or the following one.

Toads are distinguished from frogs by their sluggish creeping movements and
by their non-possession of teeth. There are over eighty species, having
collectively an almost cosmopolitan range, though they are not found in
Australia, New Guinea, Madagascar, or the Pacific Islands. The common
British species enjoys a wide distribution, being found throughout Europe,
Asia excepting India, and North-west Africa. Its somewhat clumsy, brown,
wrinkled, and warted body, with darker spots and markings on the
upper-surface and white-speckled under-surface, will be familiar to every
reader. With many it is an unwarranted object of aversion, and in country
districts is not infrequently accredited with venomous properties.
Toad-spawn is plentiful in ponds and ditches in the early spring, and may
be distinguished from that of the frog by the fact of its being deposited
in chain-like strings, the eggs being arranged in a double alternating row,
instead of in irregular masses, as obtains with the last-named species. The
individual eggs are, moreover, smaller, and deposited two or three weeks
later in the season than those of the frog. A second and somewhat rarer
British toad is known as the NATTERJACK. It may be distinguished from the
ordinary species by the shorter hind limbs, the more prominent eyes, and
the conspicuous yellow line down the middle of its back. It is also
somewhat more active than the common species.

The last member of the group which demands brief notice is the singular
WATER-TOAD of Surinam. This animal, also known as the PIPA, is an
inhabitant of the moist forest regions of the Guianas and Central America,
and remarkable on account of the singular phenomena connected with its
breeding habits. The eggs, from 60 to over 100 in number, are deposited by
the female in the water in the ordinary manner, but at this stage they are
taken in hand by the male and literally planted in the back of the female,
whose skin in this region becomes abnormally soft and thickened at this
season. The young toads undergo their complete development in the parental
integument, each egg and its resulting embryo occupying a separate
primarily cylindrical chamber, which by lateral pressure becomes hexagonal,
resembling a honeycomb-cell. Eighty-two days are occupied from the time of
the deposition of the eggs until the young toads emerge into the outer
world, their appearance as they make their _début_, with here a head and
there one or it may be two limbs thrust out from the surface of the
parent's back, being highly grotesque.

CHAPTER VII.

_NEWTS AND SALAMANDERS._


The Newts and Salamanders, or Tailed Amphibians, are distinguished from the
preceding group of the Frogs and Toads by the retention of a tail
throughout life. In this manner they very nearly resemble the advanced
larval or tadpole phases of the latter. In some instances, in fact, the
earlier or externally gill-bearing tadpole phase is persistent. The
geographical distribution of the Salamander Tribe is much less extensive
than that of the Frogs and Toads, but few are found south of the Equator,
and they are entirely unknown in Australia or in Africa south of the
Sahara.

[Illustration: _Photo by James B. Corr, Esq._]     [_Dundee._

COMMON OR SMOOTH NEWT.

This harmless little creature is accredited by many country people with
venomous properties.]

Two members of the group are indigenous to the British Islands, where they
are familiarly known as NEWTS, ASKERS, EFFETS, or EFTS. The larger and
handsomer of the two, the CRESTED NEWT, occurs in ponds and ditches
throughout the warmer months of the year. It grows to a length of nearly 6
inches, of which the tail constitutes about one moiety. Its colour is more
usually blackish or olive-brown with darker circular spots above, and
yellow or orange-red with black spots or marbling beneath, while the sides
are speckled white. In the breeding-season the colours are more especially
brilliant, and it is at this time that the male develops the serrated crest
along the middle of its back, from which it takes its title.

[Illustration: _Photo by James B. Corr, Esq._]     [_Dundee._

SMOOTH NEWT.

This species often travels long distances from water, taking up its
residence in damp cellars and vaults.]

The eggs, or spawn, of the newt are deposited in a different fashion to
those of the frog and toad. In place of being aggregated together in an
irregular or ribbon-like mass, each is deposited separately and attached to
the leaves of water-plants. By the dexterous use of its feet, the female
newt twists or folds the leaf, or a portion of it, around the egg, its
viscid envelope allowing it to readily adhere, and it is thus effectually
concealed or protected from injury. When about a quarter of a inch long,
the tadpole escapes from the egg. At this early stage the gills are quite
simple and the front limbs represented by mere knobs. Immediately in front
of the gills are two fleshy lobes, by means of which the tadpole can
temporarily adhere to the surfaces of water-plants. Within a fortnight the
little animal has grown to double the size. The gills are now elegantly
branched and the fore limbs well developed. The latter are, however, only
bifurcated at their extremities, and it is some little time later that four
distinct toes are possessed by each fore limb and that the hind limbs make
their appearance. The gills, which have at this stage reached their most
complex state of development, now begin to diminish in size, and are
gradually absorbed, the lungs in the meantime acquiring their full
functional proportions. The newt, having now passed from the fish-like to a
reptilian stage, is unable to live entirely beneath the water, and is
obliged to come up to the surface at intervals to breathe, or is adapted
for living entirely upon land. Newts in their fully matured state, except
during the breeding-season, pass much of their time on land, and wander to
considerable distances from the water. They at all times, however, exhibit
a preference for moist situations, such as a shady wood or damp cellar.

Like the toad and blind-worm, the feeble, inoffensive newt has from the
earliest time to the present day been the victim of the most unmerited
dread and persecution among the uneducated. In some country districts it is
not only accredited with the property of biting venomously, but of spitting
fire into the bitten wound. A property that is actually possessed by these
creatures is that of reproducing lost parts. The Geckos and other lizards,
as already recorded, are in the habit of reproducing their mutilated tails.
The newt, however, beats that record to the extent of reproducing lost
legs, and, it has been affirmed, eyes also.

A second species of British newt, of somewhat smaller size and even more
common than the crested one, is the COMMON or SMOOTH NEWT. It scarcely
exceeds 3 inches in length, and is distinguished by its smooth skin and
relatively less conspicuous crest. In habits it is less addicted to a
prolonged aquatic residence than the crested form, and wanders to more
considerable distances from water. One of the largest and handsomest
representatives of the family is the MARBLED NEWT of Southern France and
the Spanish Peninsula, which attains a length of 8 or 9 inches. The
upper-parts of the male at the breeding-season are bright bronze-green with
irregular black markings; its crest is ornamented with black and white
vertical bars, and a silvery white band is developed along the sides of the
tail. The crestless female has a distinctive orange streak running down the
centre of the back.

The TRUE SALAMANDERS have no British representative, though the common or
spotted species is abundant throughout Central and Southern Europe. Its
conspicuous livery--in which bold markings of black and brilliant yellow
are somewhat equally balanced, no two individuals, however, precisely
corresponding--distinguishes it broadly from all other members of the
group. The surface of the skin is very smooth and shining, and thickly set
on the surface with glands and pores, from which a viscid and undoubtedly
poisonous secretion is exuded. In common with that of other salamanders,
the tail is cylindrical, instead of compressed and oar-shaped, as in the
Newts, and there is no crest down the back. The SPOTTED SALAMANDER
frequents moist situations in mountain and forest districts. It is
essentially nocturnal in its habits, lying up during the day in some
suitable rock or mossy crevice, exposure of its sensitive skin to the
direct rays of the sun speedily having a fatal effect. Large numbers of
this salamander are sold as suitable and curious additions to the fernery
and vivarium, and will survive for long periods, appropriate food and the
necessary conditions of moisture being provided. Snails, worms, and beetles
and other insects constituting its natural food, it fulfils as useful a
rôle as the toad in the extermination of insect-pests, and may be as
strongly recommended for introduction to the greenhouse.

SPOTTED SALAMANDER.

The skin of the salamander exudes a poisonous secretion, and its bright
colours advertise its non-edible properties to carnivorous birds and
mammals.]

Salamanders repair to the water to breed, after the manner of newts, but
the young are usually brought forth alive, though occasionally eggs are
deposited, from which the young tadpoles almost immediately emerge. The
number usually produced at a birth ranges from sixteen to thirty, but
instances are recorded where there have been as many as fifty.

The colossus of the tailed Amphibian race is the GIANT SALAMANDER of China
and Japan, which may attain to a length of from 3 to 3½ feet. The body,
like that of the ordinary salamanders, is broad and depressed; but the eyes
are very small, and have no eyelids; and the tail, which is relatively
short, is compressed, and has a fin both above and beneath. This salamander
lives entirely in the water, and is adapted for such an aquatic life by the
possession of both lungs and gills. In its native habitat it is most
usually found in small, clear mountain-streams, at elevations of from 700
to 5,000 feet above the sea-level, such streams being often not more than a
foot in width, and more or less overgrown with grasses; in these the adults
are usually found curled round the larger stones, while the smaller ones
occupy holes and crevices among them.

YELLOW PHASE OF SPOTTED SALAMANDERS.

The first four or five months of the young salamander's life are passed in
the water.]

A representative of the tribe now commonly kept in aquaria is the Mexican
AXOLOTL. It has usually a velvety black skin, and grows to a length of 9 or
10 inches. As generally known it presents a very newt-like aspect, or, more
correctly, that advanced tadpole state of the newt in which the external
gills are most highly developed. The animals breed freely in the water,
eggs being laid, which pass through the earlier tadpole to the adult phase.
Up to within comparatively recent times the foregoing metamorphoses were
supposed to represent the Alpha and Omega of the animal's existence. Some
exceptional examples, however, bred in an aquarium in which rocks projected
out of the water, surprised their owners by gradually absorbing their
supposed persistent gills, also their fin-like tail-membranes, and,
crawling out on the rocks, were transformed into ordinary salamanders.

The OLM, or BLIND PROTEUS, of the subterranean caves of Dalmatia and
Carniola is a form with persistent external gills. Nearly allied is the
North American form known as the FURROWED SALAMANDER. The latter, however,
living under more normal conditions, has well-developed eyes. While
possessing the customary number of limbs, the number of toes in the
American type is four to each foot. In the European Proteus there are but
three toes to the front and two toes to the hinder limb. In a yet lower
form, the SIREN SALAMANDER of the South-eastern United States, a yet more
primitive persistently gill-bearing condition is presented.

CHAPTER I.

_LUNG-FISHES AND CHIMÆRAS._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.


Though amongst the lowest of the backboned animals, the Fishes are
nevertheless an exceedingly interesting group, distinguished from all
others by the possession of fins, which are divisible into two series,--an
unpaired, ranged along the middle of the back and abdomen, and including
the tail-fin; and a paired series, representing the fore and hind limbs of
land animals. The body is either clothed with scales or naked, and, being
perfectly sustained by the water, needs no support from the fins, which
serve as balancing-organs.

In the brilliancy and beauty of their coloration fishes display a variety
that cannot be excelled by any other animals. Furthermore, the coloration
is often rendered still more beautiful from the fact that it can undergo
rapid changes of hue. Frequently this coloration is of a protective
character, causing the fish to harmonise with its surroundings, and so
escape the observation of its enemies. The colours of living fishes can
only, for the most part, be indicated in the present pages when a pattern
exists by the formation of stripes or spots; but the wonderful variations
in the form of the body will probably prove a revelation to many.


LUNG-FISHES.

The LUNG-FISHES are a peculiarly important group, inasmuch as they form a
connecting-link between the class Fishes and the land-dwelling
Amphibians--the class containing the Frogs and Toads and their allies. They
are accorded this position mainly because, like Amphibians, they possess
true lungs, which almost entirely replace the gills, the breathing-organs
of other fishes.

One of the best known of the lung-fishes is the AUSTRALIAN BARRAMUNDI, or
LUNG-FISH OF QUEENSLAND--the BURNETT or DAWSON SALMON of the settlers. It
lives among the weeds at the bottom of muddy rivers, rising frequently to
the surface to take in atmospheric air by the lungs, the gills alone being
insufficient for breathing purposes. The flesh, which is salmon-coloured,
is much esteemed as food. The adult fish is said to attain to a weight of
20 lbs. and a length of 6 feet.

Other lung-fishes, eel-like in form, occur in the rivers of Africa and
South America. The African species is perhaps the better known of the two.
On the approach of the dry season it buries itself in the mud at the bottom
of the river, and when the latter becomes dry the mud hardens, holding the
fish a prisoner till the return of the wet season several months later. A
considerable number of these fishes have from time to time been dug out and
sent to England enclosed in the mud into which they had retreated. The
writer remembers assisting in the liberation of some during the last
meeting of the British Association at Oxford. So hard had the prison-walls
become that the mass had to be plunged into tepid water; this soon brought
about a dissolution of the soil, and in a short time the fishes were
swimming about as if in their native rivers. The African lung-fish is known
also as the MUD-FISH; its American relative as the LEPIDOSIREN, or SOUTH
AMERICAN MUD-FISH. In the American species, as in its African relative, the
fins are whip-like in form; but the hinder or ventral pair, which
correspond to the hind limbs of the higher vertebrated animals, are
remarkable in that in the male they develop during the breeding-season
numerous thread-like processes, richly supplied with blood, the function of
which is as yet unknown.

The young, both of the African and South American mud-fishes, bear external
gills closely resembling those of the tadpoles of the frog and other
Amphibia; traces of these gills remain throughout life in the African form.

CHIMÆRAS.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BOTTLE-NOSED CHIMÆRA.

The remarkable structure in front of the mouth is probably an organ of
touch.]

Shark-like in their general characters, the CHIMÆRAS, now briefly
considered, are nevertheless regarded as constituting a very distinct group
of great antiquity.

The modern representatives of the group are few in number--five species in
all. Of these, the species shown in the accompanying photograph and the
SEA-CAT are remarkable for the possession of a movable tentacle on the
snout. The under surface of this tentacle is armed with small spines, and
fits into a hollow in the head. The first back-fin is supported in front by
a strong spine, and can be depressed into a sheath in the body-walls. The
teeth take the form of large plates closely united with the jaws, and
studded with hardened points, or "tritors."

One species widely distributed in the Mediterranean and Atlantic is taken
usually in deep water; it is the largest living species, often attaining a
yard in length. Its occurrence is, however, very erratic, months elapsing
without any being taken; at other times several will be caught in a few
days. A closely allied fish is often exposed for sale in the Lisbon
markets, where it ranks with the Sharks as a food-fish.

The egg of the BOTTLE-NOSED CHIMÆRA is perhaps the only egg with a mimetic
resemblance to a foreign object. It is elliptical in form, and bordered by
a fringe, so as to present a close resemblance to a piece of seaweed.

In the next chapter we begin the description of the great group of Fan- and
Fringe-finned Fishes, which, briefly, embrace all fishes not grouped among
the Lung-fishes, Chimæras, or Sharks. The anatomical characters used for
the purpose of classifying this great group are not discussed here, save
only in a few cases of prime importance, when features such as can readily
be observed, without demanding an intimate knowledge of anatomy, are
selected.

CHAPTER II.

_THE PERCH FAMILY._

BY JOHN BICKERDYKE, M.A.

The thick-set, golden-bronze, dark-barred, hog-backed fish known as the
PERCH has many striking characteristics, and is remarkable, among other
things, for the vast number of its relations scattered all over the world.
So numerous, indeed, are its cousins that ichthyologists have had to divide
the Perch Family into a large number of groups. There are various species
of perch found, as a matter of fact, in the fresh-waters and on all the
coasts of the temperate and tropical regions.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

LARGE-MOUTHED BLACK BASS.

The introduction of this fish into the fresh-waters of Great Britain has
been frequently urged.]

The COMMON PERCH, which is widely distributed over Europe, Northern Asia,
and North America, is properly an inhabitant of rivers, lakes, and ponds,
but sometimes descends to brackish water. It runs up to about 5 lbs. in
weight, and is carnivorous, eating most kinds of fish small enough for its
swallow, including the fry of its own species, which are, in some waters,
an excellent bait.

In England perch spawn in the spring, the eggs being held in a band-like
mass of gelatinous matter deposited on weeds or the roots of trees not far
below the surface of the water. The spawn, as a matter of fact, is often
collected by fish-culturists and hatched out. Swans and water-fowl
generally eat the eggs by the million, and wherever perch are preserved
these birds should, so far as possible, be kept from the water during the
spawning-season. At Henley and other places on the Thames those interested
in fishery preservation place wire netting round the boughs and weeds where
perch have spawned, to prevent the eggs being eaten by swans and ducks.

BUTTER-FISH.

A native of the tropical parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean.]

Perch are usually termed voracious fish, but when large are extremely shy
and difficult of capture. There is a story told of a hungry little
lake-perch which had its eye hooked out by accident. The angler, leaving
the eye on the hook, lowered it into the water again, and a moment after
hauled out a one-eyed perch!

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

AMERICAN "SUN-FISH."

Not to be confounded with the true Sun-fishes described in Chapter VII.]

Among the species of perch found in British waters are the RUFFE, or POPE,
a very small and common river-fish of no great value; the BASS, a fine
sporting sea-fish, which comes up the estuaries of rivers to spawn, and is
much sought after by the amateur sea-fisher; the COMBER, or GAPER, a fairly
common fish on the coasts of the West of England; a rare sea-fish known as
the DUSKY PERCH, caught occasionally off the South of England; the
STONE-BASS, also called the WRECK-FISH, from its habit of following
wreckage in the sea; and, lastly, the DENTEX, a rare species, not often
caught off the British coasts, which attains the weight of about 70 lbs.

On the Continent there is the PIKE-PERCH, a fish having the appearance of a
cross between a pike and a perch, and growing to 25 or 30 lbs.; this
voracious species is found in the lakes and rivers of the temperate
northern zones, and is much esteemed for food. In the tropics there are a
number of true SEA-PERCHES, which rarely enter fresh-water; they include
the ANTHIAS, most beautifully coloured with pink and yellow, of which there
are between 100 and 200 species. Some of the tropical sea-perches grow to
an enormous size, and there are instances recorded of bathers having been
attacked by them at Aden. Several monsters are stuffed in the Natural
History Museum at South Kensington. Among the coral-islands live many very
beautifully coloured sea-perches of various species. Perhaps the most
remarkable of all is the BOAR-FISH, or BASTARD DORY, which has a prolonged
snout, no doubt used for getting out its food from the crannies among rocks
and other awkward places.

CHAPTER III.

_SCALY-FINS, RED MULLETS, SEA-BREAMS, SCORPION-FISHES, SLIME-HEADS,
TASSEL-FISH, MEAGRES, AND SWORD-FISHES._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

For quaintness of shape, combined with beauty of coloration, the family of
Scaly-finned Fishes has no rivals. The name by which they are collectively
known refers to the scaly covering which invests the bases of what are
called the median fins--the fins seated along the middle of the back and
abdomen. A large number of distinct species have been described, the
majority of which occur in tropical seas, and especially in the
neighbourhood of coral-reefs; but some frequent the mouths of rivers, which
they occasionally ascend for a short distance. All are of relatively small
size, of carnivorous habits, and but little used for food.

The pattern of coloration commonly takes the form of bands or stripes,
those in which this pattern is most marked being known as ZEBRA-FISH. One
of the most beautiful is the EMPEROR-FISH, which ranges from the east coast
of Africa to the Indian and Malayan seas. The ground-colour of the body is
deep blue, relieved by some thirty golden-yellow stripes running from the
shoulder backwards to the tail. Crossing the head is a crescent-shaped bar
of black edged with yellow, whilst a similarly coloured patch runs upward
from the pectoral fins to within a short distance of the top of the back.
This species, which attains a length of 15 inches, is highly esteemed for
food in India. The most beautiful of all, perhaps, is the zebra-fish of the
Indo-Malayan seas, which has the ground-colour of yellow, striped with
vertical bars of blue edged with brown, a yellow tail, and an anal fin
barred with narrow blue lines.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

THE MISCALLED ARCHER-FISH.

So named on account of its supposed habit of shooting water at insects.]

A tubed-shaped mouth is a common feature of the fishes of this group, and
two Indian species in which this character is especially well developed
have acquired the habit of shooting therefrom a drop of water at insects
resting on overhanging foliage fringing the sea or along the banks of
rivers. Having sighted its quarry, it would seem the fish moves upwards to
the surface of the water, and with careful aim ejects its liquid bullet
with such unerring precision that its prey is invariably knocked down and
speedily seized. On this account these fishes are commonly known as
ARCHER-FISHES. The archer-fishes are sometimes kept in tubs of water, for
the purpose of affording amusement to their captors. Somehow the shooting
prowess of these fishes has been accredited to an allied form, shown in the
above photograph.

The peculiar shape of these fishes is sufficiently indicated by the
photograph already mentioned, but a large series would be necessary to show
the numerous variations, some of which are quite remarkable. The brilliancy
of the coloration is probably protective, since the most brightly coloured
forms live amongst coral-reefs built by gorgeous polyps, or coral-animals,
so that amidst such surroundings the fishes are quite inconspicuous.

The RED MULLETS occur chiefly in tropical seas, but one species inhabits
European waters, and occur sparsely around the British Islands.
Occasionally, however, these fishes visit the British coasts in vast
shoals, more than 5,000 having been taken in a single night in August,
1819, in Weymouth Bay, whilst in May, 1851, 10,000 were taken off Yarmouth
in one week.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

STRIPED RED MULLET.

The head is ornamented with brilliant blue and violet stripes.]

Although about forty species of red mullet are known, the European species
is the most prized as a food-fish. Its fame, indeed, extends backwards to
the time of the ancient Romans, who sought far and wide for large
specimens, paying ruinous prices for them. "Then, as nowadays," writes Dr.
Günther, "it was considered essential for the enjoyment of this delicacy
that the fish should exhibit the red colour of its integument. The Romans
brought it, for that purpose, living into the banqueting-room, and allowed
it to die in the hands of the guests, the red colour appearing in all its
brilliancy during the death-struggle of the fish. The fishermen of our
times attain the same object by scaling the fish immediately after its
capture, thus causing a permanent contraction of the chromatophores
containing the red pigment."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BROWN SNAPPER.

The snappers are esteemed for the table.]

Beneath the chin of the red mullets will be noticed two long finger-like
processes; these can be thrust forward and moved about, or laid back in a
groove between the sides of the lower jaw, and are used to rake about in
the sand and gravel at the bottom of the sea to discover burrowing shrimps
or worms. Even dead food they are said to feel with these barbels, as they
are called, before biting. The red colour has been observed in the Marine
Aquarium at Plymouth to become darker when the fish rise from the ground,
and to pale away when they descend.

Two forms of red mullet occur in European waters, but it is not yet finally
settled whether they represent distinct species. The one is the plain RED
MULLET, of a rich carmine-red above and silvery white below; the other the
STRIPED MULLET, or SUR-MULLET, which has a beautiful red colour on the back
and sides, and from three to five bright yellow bands passing from head to
tail. Till recently the striped form was regarded as the female of the
plain red mullet, but many authorities incline to the view that the two are
distinct species.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

RED SEA-BREAM.

Some species of sea-bream occasionally enter fresh-water.]

The SEA-BREAMS are fishes of the tropical and temperate regions,
represented by a considerable number of species. Only one is at all
abundant on the British coasts, and this occurs especially on the south and
south-west coasts of England and Ireland. It is of an orange-scarlet colour
above, and somewhat silvery on the sides, with a large black spot on the
shoulder.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SNAPPER.

An Australian species of Sea-bream.]

Several species of sea-bream occur in Australia, where they are known as
SNAPPERS. One of the largest of these, which attains a length of more than
3 feet and a weight of over 40 lbs., is not only considered excellent
eating, but is also the most popular sport-yielding fish of that colony.

The ancient Romans kept a species of sea-bream, the GILT-HEAD, in their
vivariums, where it grew extremely fat. This species is said to stir up the
sand with its tail, to discover buried shell-fish. It is particularly fond
of mussels, and the noise it makes in crunching them between its jaws is
loud enough to be heard by the fishermen.

Nearly allied to the Sea-breams are a group known, for want of a better
name, as the THICK-RAYED FISHES, some of which rank as of prime importance
among the food-fishes of the British Colonies. A general idea of the shape
of the members of this family may be gathered from the photograph of an
Australian GROPER. The name of LONG-FIN, given to one species, is bestowed
on account of the fact that one or more of the rays of the breast-fin on
each side is drawn out into a filament, often of very considerable length,
which is used as an organ of touch. In other species, where the elongation
is less, and more rays have undergone modification, an auxiliary organ of
locomotion is the result. At the Cape of Good Hope species of long-fin are
very abundant, and preserved in large quantities for export.

Other members of this family lack the elongated fin-rays altogether. The
fishes known as the TUMPETERS of New Zealand and Tasmania belong to this
section. They are considered by the colonists the best flavoured of any
native fishes, and are eaten smoked as well as fresh. But two species are
known, one ranging from 30 to 60 lbs. in weight, and the other, a much
smaller form, scarcely attaining a weight of 20 lbs.; the latter is the
more abundant of the two, though confined to the coast of New Zealand.


[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

KING-SNAPPER.

A member of the group of Slime-heads.]

In the SCORPION-FISHES we have a small group including several forms
remarkable for their ugliness, having added to an uncouth shape skinny
appendages, which, projecting from the body, resemble rather leaves of
seaweed than parts of the fish. These appendages, by their waving motion,
serve either to attract other fishes or to afford concealment by their
resemblance to the surrounding weeds. The ground-dwelling forms have some
of the rays of the breast-fin modified into finger-like processes, like
those of the Gurnards, by which they both crawl and feel. Some members of
the family bear a rather close resemblance to the Sea-perches. In addition
to their ugliness, some have become especially offensive by the
transformation of certain of the fin-spines into poison-organs.

One of the ugliest, and at the same time most dreaded, of the family is the
STONE-FISH figured on page 619. Each spine of the back fin is grooved. At
the lower end of these grooves lies a pear-shaped bag containing a milky
poison, which is conveyed to the point of the spine by ducts lying in the
grooves. The native fishermen carefully avoid handling these fish; but
persons walking with bare feet in the sea step upon the spines, and,
receiving the poison into the wound, are killed.

[Illustration: Photo by _W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN GROPER.

Highly esteemed as a food-fish.]

All the scorpion-fish are carnivorous, and differ from the majority of
fishes in that they produce their young alive. The smallest of the
Spiny-finned fishes are members of this group, some scarcely exceeding 1½
inch in length. They are common amid the coral-reefs of the Pacific.

Passing over some comparatively unimportant members of this family, we come
to a small group of vegetable-feeders from the Indo-Pacific, of which the
TEUTHIS is one of the best known representatives. They are chiefly
remarkable for the fact that the abdominal cavity is surrounded by a
complete ring of bones, and that the air-bladder is forked at both ends.
Some are rather brilliantly coloured.

The SLIME-HEADS, which constitute the next family, derive their name from
the presence on the head of large mucus-bearing cavities covered with a
thin skin. The eyes are always of great size, indicating a deep-sea
habitat, or at least a depth only dimly lighted. All indeed, save two
species, descend considerably below the surface, one species having been
found in 345 fathoms. The species of one genus are believed to inhabit
still greater depths, for their eyes are extremely small, indicating
degeneration through disuse. The copious supply of slime is also an
indication of a deep-sea habitat. The members of this family vary much in
size and shape, but the most remarkable of all is a small and rare species
found off Japan, in which the scales have joined together to form a
perfectly solid armour, whilst the paired fins of the abdomen have been
reduced to a single spine, with a few vestiges of other rays.

INDIAN WEAVER-FISH.

The next family, a comparatively small one, includes the TASSEL-FISH, so
called from the long and delicate feelers springing from the base of the
breast-fins, of which they originally formed a part. Varying in number from
three to fourteen, these feelers can be moved independently of the fins. As
these fishes all live in muddy water, and have the eyes obscured by films,
such tactile organs are necessary, in order to enable them to procure their
food. In some species they attain an enormous length. The flesh is highly
esteemed. Some species have an air-bladder, which yields a good kind of
isinglass, and forms an article of commerce in the East Indies. The
majority are small species, but some attain to a length of 4 feet.

No less important than the preceding group, from an economic point of view,
are the MEAGRES, a family of coast-haunting species of the tropical and
sub-tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans, exhibiting a special preference
for the mouths of large rivers, into which they freely enter. Some, indeed,
have become entirely fresh-water species.

One of the most interesting of the family is the species to which the name
of DRUM has been given, from the extraordinary noise which it
produces--though some other kinds emit similar noises. "These sounds," Dr.
Günther writes, "can better be expressed by the word 'drumming' than any
other. They appear to be very frequently heard by persons in vessels lying
at anchor off the coasts of the United States, where these fishes are very
common. The precise method by which these sounds are produced is not known.
Since they are accompanied by a tremulous motion of the vessel, it seems
more probable that they are due to the beating of the tails of the fish
against the bottom of the ship to get rid of the parasites with which that
part of their body is infested." The drum attains a length of more than 4
feet and a weight of over 100 lbs.

Though forming but a single small family, the SWORD-FISHES are nevertheless
to be reckoned amongst the most interesting of living fishes. Attaining a
length of from 12 to 15 feet, exceeding vigilant, pugnacious, and powerful,
they are amongst the most formidable of all fishes. They derive their name
from the great development of the upper jaw, which forms a huge, tapering,
sword-like weapon, covered along its under-surface with numerous small
teeth. They attack, apparently without provocation, whales and other large
cetaceans, which they invariably succeed in killing by repeated thrusts of
the sword. It appears that occasionally sword-fishes make a mistake, and,
after the fashion of Don Quixote, tilt at windmills, in the shape of large
vessels, under the impression that they are whales. But this most grave
error of judgment brings with it a heavy penalty, in that, having no power
to make effective backward movements, the sword remains fixed, and is
eventually broken off in the struggle for freedom. Frank Buckland reminds
us that in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, is a
section of the bow of a whaler impaled by one of these swords. That portion
of the sword which remains is 1 foot long and 5 inches in circumference.
"At one single blow," he writes, "the fish had plunged his sword through,
and completely transfixed 13½ inches of solid timber. The sword had of
course broken off and prevented a dangerous leak in the ship." In the
British Museum is a second specimen of a ship's side in which the sword of
a sword-fish is fixed.

_HAIR-TAILS, HORSE-MACKERELS, SEA-BATS, DORIES, MACKERELS, SUCKING-FISHES,
WEAVERS, FROG-FISHES, ANGLER-FISHES, BULL-HEADS, AND GURNARDS._

[Illustration: _Photo by Percy Ashenden._]     [_Cape Town._

SNOEK.

This fish is also known as the Barracuda.]

Of the family of HAIR-TAILS perhaps the most important members are the
SCABBARD- or FROST-FISH and the SNOEK. The first is common in the
Mediterranean and the warmer parts of the Atlantic, extending northwards to
the south coast of England, where it occurs at rare intervals. It is also
known in New Zealand, where it is called the Frost-fish, and furthermore is
regarded as one of the most delicious fish of the colony, its flesh being
fine, tender, and of delicate flavour. On this account it is much in
demand, but the supply is very uncertain. The conditions of capture,
indeed, of this fish are unparalleled in the annals of fishing, for it can
be taken neither with the rod nor the net. The would-be captor has to wait
patiently under favourable conditions on the seashore for the fish to come
and cast itself up on the beach. This happens with tolerable certainty
during the autumn and winter months, when the sea is calm and the nights
frosty. Then the frost-fish come ashore alive, wriggling through the surf
on to the beach. Two explanations have been offered for this extraordinary
conduct. One is that the fish commits suicide; being pursued by a shark or
other enemy, it prefers uncertain life on land to certain death at sea! The
other and more probable hypothesis has it that the air-bladder of the fish
becomes distended to enable it to reach the surface for food--for it is a
deep-sea fish--and that the keen, frosty air prevents it from compressing
the bladder and returning to the depths; thus it gradually drifts into
shallow water, is hurled shorewards by the surf, and finally wriggles
itself on to the beach to die. The long stretches of sandy beach a few
miles from Dunedin are a favourite resort for frost-fish catching. Two or
three men camp out at the foot of the cliffs overhanging the beach,
pitching a tent and lighting a huge fire, so as to render life bearable
during the long vigils. The "fishing" consists in perambulating the beach
up and down shortly before dawn, and keeping a sharp look-out in the surf
for the silver streak which betokens the approach of a victim. As soon as a
fish is descried, all that remains to be done is to seize hold of it and
drag it ashore, if it has not already stranded itself, and then dispatch
it.

The strong keel formed by ridged scales running down each side of the tail
is a characteristic feature.]

The BARRACUDA, or SNOEK, is likewise a New Zealand species, attaining a
length of 5 feet. It is found also at the Cape and South Australia. In New
Zealand the flesh is exported to Mauritius and Batavia as a regular article
of commerce, being worth £17 per ton.

JOHN DORIES.

These two photographs show the difference in the jaws when protruded and
when at rest.]

The HORSE-MACKERELS, or SCADS, are represented by some very bizarre-looking
forms. It is a large family, belonging to tropical and temperate seas. One
species, the COMMON HORSE MACKEREL, is common in British seas. Many members
of the family have the hinder portion of the body on each side armed with
large plates, well seen in the accompanying photographs; others have the
median fins produced into long filamentous processes. All are eatable, and
some highly esteemed as food. One of the most remarkable is the PILOT-FISH
of tropical and temperate seas, occurring occasionally off the British
coasts. It derives its name from its habit of accompanying ships and large
sharks. From this habit of accompanying ships it was regarded by the
ancients as a sacred fish, since they considered it pointed out the way to
embarrassed sailors, and announced the vicinity of land by suddenly
disappearing. The close companionship between the pilot-fish and the shark
has excited much comment, many observers believing that the former was of
great use to the latter in guiding it to its food. How this is done is
graphically described by Dr. Meyer, who writes: "The pilot swims constantly
in front of the shark; we ourselves have seen three instances in which the
shark was led by the pilot. When the shark neared the ship, the pilot swam
close to the snout or near one of the pectoral fins of the animal.
Sometimes he darted rapidly forwards or sidewards, as if looking for
something, and constantly went back again to the shark. When we threw
overboard a piece of bacon fastened on a great hook, the shark was about
twenty paces from the ship; with the quickness of lightning the pilot came
up, smelt at the dainty, and instantly swam back again to the shark,
swimming many times round his snout and splashing, as if to give him exact
information as to the bacon. The shark now began to put himself in motion,
the pilot showing him the way, and in a moment he was fast upon the hook."
As Dr. Günther remarks, commenting on this account, one may entertain
reasonable doubts as to the usefulness of the pilot to the shark in this
instance! It is probable that the pilots follow the sharks for the sake of
feeding on fragments scattered by the latter, and also for the sake of
picking off the parasites with which sharks, in common with other large
fish, are infested; furthermore, the pilot, being but a small fish, obtains
greater security from enemies when in the company of its giant friend. The
habit of seeking the company of more powerful or otherwise offensive
animals is apparent also in other members of this family, the young of the
horse-mackerel seeking shelter beneath the "umbrella" of a jelly-fish till
they are big enough to defend themselves.

But the most remarkable members of this family are the SEA-BATS. Few in
species and confined to the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Western Pacific,
they are nevertheless in those regions very common. Although not used as
food-fishes, they are of extreme interest on account of their shape, which
is nearly oval and much compressed from side to side, and the form of their
fins, which in some species are excessively developed. Young sea-bats
differ markedly from the adults in the much greater length of the fin-rays,
so much so that they have frequently been described as distinct species.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [Milford-on-Sea.

LONG-FINNED DORY.

This species closely resembles a fossil form. It has nothing to do with the
True Dories, but is one of the Coral-fishes, and is placed here for the
sake of contrast.]

We pass now to the DORIES, which recall the Sea-bats in the oval and
compressed form of the body. The resemblance to sea-bats is, indeed, so
close that the latter are frequently described as dories. The mouth of the
members of this family is so constructed that, when opened, the upper jaw
is thrust forward, and the whole mouth forms a kind of long tube. Dories
inhabit the seas of the temperate regions, two species being fairly common
in British waters. The best known of these two is perhaps the John Dory,
the largest specimens of which attain to a weight of 18 lbs. Mr. Cunningham
has described the very peculiar way in which the dory captures its prey.
"It does not," he writes, "overtake it by superior speed like the mackerel,
or lie in wait for it like the angler, but stalks it and approaches it by
stealth. It is able to do this in consequence of the extreme thinness of
its body and the peculiar movement of its hinder dorsal and ventral fins.
The dory places itself end on towards the fish it desires to devour, and in
this position it is evident that it excites no alarm on the part of its
prey. The appearance of the dory, seen in this way, is a mere line in the
water, to which no particular significance can be attached. I have not
particularly noticed the effect of the ribbons of membrane which project
from the dorsal fin. But I have observed that the movements of the dory are
very gradual, except in turning; it alters the position of its body by a
turn of the tail or side-fins, and then swims forward by vibrating the
second dorsal and ventral, a movement which causes very slight disturbance
of the water. The appearance of the dory in these actions is suggestive of
suppressed excitement, his eyes being fixed on his prey. I do not recollect
seeing him actually swallow another fish, but have no doubt that he gets
near enough to a sprat, for example, without alarming it, to seize it by
the sudden elongation of his curious jaws." The way in which these jaws are
elongated is admirably shown in the photograph on page 622.

Passing now to the Mackerel Family, we arrive at a group of considerable
importance from an economic point of view. Extremely active, migrating, and
predaceous, mackerel swim in shoals and seize their prey with great
voracity, hunting merely by sight, and snapping at anything moving through
the water, especially if it is silvery, like a small surface-fish. The
various species differ greatly in size, ranging from the Common Mackerel of
about 18 inches long to the giant Tunny weighing nearly half a ton.

COMMON MACKEREL swim in vast shoals, or "schools," as they are called, and
one half a mile wide and at least twenty miles long is on record. Mackerel
feed on the young of other fish and small fish generally, and, when these
are not to be had, on minute crabs and shrimps. They are very prolific, a
single mackerel laying from 430,000 to 540,000 eggs.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

JOHN DORY.

In the centre of each side is a round black spot surrounded by a pale
yellow ring.]

The TUNNIES are amongst the largest of the surface-fishes of the ocean.
Abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, they occur occasionally in British
waters. For centuries the flesh of the tunny has been held in high regard
as food, and it is frequently seen in the Lisbon markets at the present
day. The flesh, which is as red as beef, is cut up and sold by weight. The
BONITO closely resembles the tunny, but is a much smaller fish, which preys
largely upon flying-fishes, which it follows for long distances.

Peculiarly interesting are the SUCKING-FISHES. The name by which they are
commonly known is bestowed on account of the presence of a large oval
sucker, placed on the top of the head and extending backwards over the
shoulders--an organ formed by modification of the back-fin. By means of
this sucking-disk these fishes are enabled to attach themselves to sharks,
turtles, ships, or any large object floating in the sea. The hold which
they obtain is so strong that it is almost impossible to remove them by
force. Being poor swimmers, this method of transportation enables them to
pass rapidly to fresh feeding-grounds.

The natives of Zanzibar, Cuba, and Torres Straits are said to employ
sucking-fishes in the capture of sleeping turtles, the fish being secured
by a ring round the tail, and liberated as soon as a sufficiently near
approach to the quarry has been made. About ten different species are
known, the bulkiest of which attains a length of 2 feet and a weight of
about 8 lbs., a longer but more slender species measuring 3 feet.

Carnivorous, of small size, and feeble swimming-powers, the family of the
WEAVERS are remarkable rather for their disagreeable qualities than
anything else, though at least one species is declared to be excellent
eating. The STAR-GAZER is a particularly ugly-looking fish, especially
noteworthy in that the eyes, which are on the top of the head, can be
raised and depressed at pleasure, whilst the heavy jaw is armed with a
freely moving tentacle, which, waving about in the current of water drawn
in at the mouth, serves as a lure to attract small fishes, the rest of the
body being concealed between stones at the bottom of the sea.

SUCKING-FISH.

By means of the sucker on the top of its head this fish attaches itself to
ships and larger fishes.]

The COMMON WEAVER is a well-known British fish, much dreaded on account of
the poisonous wounds which it inflicts unless most carefully handled, the
poison being introduced by the spines of the back-fin and gill-cover. No
special poison-organs seem to be developed, but the mucous secretion around
the spines has poisonous properties. As the flesh of this fish is extremely
palatable, fishermen remove the spines at once directly after capture.
Should a wound be inflicted, great suffering and occasionally death
follows.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

LARGER WEAVER.

The spines of the first back-fin and of the gill-cover are highly
poisonous.]

Passing over one or two unimportant groups, we come to the family of the
FROG-FISHES, which, but for the fact that many of its members are
poisonous, calls for no special comment here. One species, however, from
the coasts of Central America, possesses the distinction of having the most
highly developed poison-organs of any fishes, being equalled only by the
Venomous Snakes. The poison-weapons are a spine on the gill-cover and two
spines of the back-fin. The former is of the same shape as the hollow
venom-fang of a snake, perforated at both ends. A little bag containing the
poison lies at the base of the spine, and when pressed by the spine as it
makes its puncture ejects its contents into the body of the latter, whence
it escapes from the hole in the top. The structure of the back-spines is
similar.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

ANGLER-FISH.

This hideous species is also called the Frog-fish.]

The family of the ANGLER-FISHES contain more strange forms than any other.
Living on the sea-bottom and seeking their prey by stealth, angler-fishes
do not need powerful swimming-muscles; consequently the size of the body
and tail has become considerably reduced, so that the head, relatively to
the rest of the body, is unusually large. The head, jaws, and belly are
indeed of great size and capacity. The side or paired fins are not used for
swimming, but have become modified to serve as feet, enabling the fish to
shuffle along the ground. A further remarkable feature of these fishes is
seen in the back-fin, the rays of which are very long, the foremost being
provided with a flag-like flap of skin at the top, extremely sensitive to
touch, and playing a very important part in the capture of food. It seems
that the fish commonly lies concealed on the sea-bottom, with this "flag"
erected. From its general resemblance to the surrounding seaweed it is
quite inconspicuous, so that passing fishes take no trouble to avoid it. If
by any chance they should touch it, however, the jaws beneath open
instantly, and the unfortunate trespasser is suddenly engulfed. This
elaborate and sensitive mechanism has been likened to a spring-trap, which
is always set, and never betrays its presence. It seems probable, however,
that this flag serves also as a lure, passing fishes being occasionally
attracted by the waving flap of skin. Should they become sufficiently
curious as to proceed to touch it, capture in the manner above described is
certain. Certain deep-sea forms have a luminous organ in the place of the
flap of skin, and this certainly seems to act only as a lure.

Angler-fishes are found all over the world; some, as we have seen, are
bottom-fishes, some inhabit deep sea, whilst others lie hidden amongst
floating seaweed, to which they cling by means of their arm-like fins. Only
one species occurs in British waters. Its method of spawning is remarkable,
in that the eggs are laid in the form of large raft-like sheets, which
float on the surface of the sea. The number of eggs laid by a single fish
has been computed to be 1,345,000. A single sheet of spawn may measure from
2 to 3 feet in breadth and from 25 to 30 feet long.

[_Milford-on-Sea._

BUTTERFLY-GURNARD.

The head of all gurnards is encased in an armour of bony plates.]

The BULL-HEADS and GURNARDS, constituting the next family, are
characterised by the spiny armature of the head and the great size of the
breast-fins. The former are represented in British waters by four species,
one of which, the MILLER'S-THUMB, inhabits fresh-water. The marine species
include the SEA-SCORPION and FATHER-LASHER.

The BULL-HEADS on the Indian and Australian coasts are represented by the
closely allied FLAT-HEADS, or CROCODILE-FISHES, in which the head, as its
name implies, is much depressed, and fully armed with spines, which are
highly poisonous, and cause a violent irritation. These fishes live in
shallow water, lying on the bottom, with which their colours harmonise so
completely that they are practically invisible. The very large ventral
fins--those seen in the photograph immediately behind the breast-fins--are
of great use in locomotion.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

REEL-GURNARD.

The curious finger-like processes are used as organs of touch as well as
locomotion.]

The GURNARDS are well-known fishes, common on the coasts of Britain, and
extending from tropical to arctic seas. Their curiously shaped heads give
them a very quaint appearance. One of the most remarkable peculiarities of
these fishes is the separate condition of some of the rays of the
breast-fins, which form finger-like organs, used to feel the ground and
rake over loose stones, to discover small shrimps and other animals hidden
underneath. Furthermore, the gurnards are peculiar in that they are enabled
to communicate one with another by means of sounds produced by the
expulsion of air from one compartment of the air-bladder to another. The
females are much more common than the males, and also slightly larger. The
young are remarkable for the enormous size of the breast-fins, though even
in the adult these are unusually large.

About forty species of flat-heads are known.]

Close allies of the Gurnards are the FLYING-GURNARDS, which, by reason of
the extreme development of the breast-fins, are enabled to take flying
leaps out of the water. One species is common in the Mediterranean. The
flying-gurnard is not to be mistaken for the true "flying-fish," or
flying-herring, described later.

The curious mail-clad ARMED BULL-HEAD, or POGGE, commonly taken in
shrimp-nets, is an ally of the flying-gurnard.

CHAPTER V.

_LUMP-SUCKERS, GOBIES, BLENNIES, BARRACUDAS, GREY MULLETS, STICKLEBACKS AND
THEIR ALLIES, GARPIKE, AND FLYING-FISHES._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

Ugly in appearance and carnivorous in habits, the Sucker-fish Family are
distinguished by the presence of a large round sucker on the belly, with
which they adhere to rocks. Furthermore, the sucker-fishes are remarkable
for the softness of their skeleton, which may be cut through at any point
with an ordinary knife. The male lump-sucker is smaller than the female,
but much more brightly coloured, especially during the breeding-season,
when he dons a livery of blue, scarlet, and yellow. He is also a model
parent, always remaining near the eggs and keeping a constant stream of
fresh water running over them by the action of his breast-fins. A single
female may produce as many as 136,000 eggs in a single season. In Scotland
the male is known as the COCK and the female as the HEN PADDLE. The species
is more common off the coasts of Scotland than elsewhere in the British
Islands.

Like the Lump-suckers, the GOBIES, which form the next family, have the
ventral fins modified so as to form a sucking-disk, which is used as an
anchor. But the gobies are easily distinguished by their smaller size,
elongated bodies, hard skeleton, and the disposition and structure of the
fins, characters which need not be discussed further.

One species, the SPOTTED GOBY, or POLE-WING, found in the Thames, is
noteworthy on account of its nest-building habits. The male chooses the
empty shell of a cockle or mussel, selecting one with its concave surface
downwards. Beneath this the sand is cleared away and cemented by a special
glue-like secretion formed by the skin of the fish. A cylindrical tunnel is
then built to give access to the nest, and the whole is covered over with
loose stones. In the nest-chamber formed by the shell the eggs are laid,
the male immediately after mounting guard over them till they hatch, which
they do in about nine days.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

LUMP-SUCKER.

Known also as the Cock and Hen Paddle.]

Another species, the PELLUCID GOBY, is remarkable in that its whole life's
course is run in a single year. In June and July the eggs are laid; they
are hatched in August; by the time winter has arrived the fish have reached
maturity, and die off in the following July and August, so that in
September only the fry are to be met with.

One of the strangest of all fishes is a member of the Goby Family. This is
the WALKING-FISH, so called from its habit of spending most of its time on
the mud-banks of rivers, or on the roots of trees growing in the
neighbourhood. The late Surgeon-General Day, describing these fishes as he
saw them along the side of the Burmese rivers, writes that at first sight
they look like large tadpoles. When suddenly startled by something, away
they go with a hop, skip, and a jump inland among the trees, or on the
water like a flat stone or piece of slate sent skimming by a schoolboy.
When climbing, the breast-fins are used, as if they were arms, to grasp the
boughs. If placed in deep water, these fishes are speedily drowned!

The BLENNIES are fishes whose skins are soft, slimy, and quite scaleless,
or at most covered with very tiny and degenerate scales. The general form
of the body may be seen in the photograph below. They are shore-fishes,
lurking about in the crevices of rocks, among seaweed, or under stones, and
occurring generally along the coasts of temperate and tropical regions. The
species known as the SEA-CAT or WOLF-FISH is, however, a deep-water form.

As a rule the eggs are deposited in hollow places between stones or rocks;
but in the BUTTER-FISH, or GUNNEL, the eggs are adhesive, and the parents
roll them into a ball by coiling their bodies round them. Furthermore,
since the parents are frequently found, under natural conditions, coiled
round these masses of spawn, it appears that they adopt this method of
guarding their treasures. Some species bring forth their young alive.

The largest of the family is the WOLF-FISH, whose jaws are armed with very
powerful teeth, able to crush the hardest shells, such as those of the
whelk. Sea-urchins and crabs are also eaten.

We pass on to a group comprising three families--the BARRACUDAS,
SAND-SMELTS, and GREY MULLETS.

It should be mentioned that two very distinct fishes are known as
BARRACUDAS, one of which we have already described under the name of Snoek.
The forms described here as barracudas are large, voracious fishes living
in tropical and sub-tropical seas, and evincing a preference for the coast
rather than the open sea. Attaining a length of 8 feet and a weight of 40
lbs., they are a source of danger to bathers. They are very frequently used
as food, though in the West Indies such food is attended with some danger,
as the flesh is often poisonous, from the fish having fed on smaller
poisonous fishes.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

BLENNY.

Blennies have soft, shiny, scaleless skins.]

The SAND-SMELTS are small carnivorous species inhabiting the seas of
temperate and tropical regions. Many enter fresh-water, and some have
become entirely acclimatised there. Some species bear a very close
resemblance to the true smelt, from which, however, they may be readily
distinguished by their small, spinous, first back-fin. The young of at
least one small group or genus of this family are remarkable for their
habit of clinging together for some time after they are hatched in dense
masses and almost incredible numbers.

The GREY MULLETS are brackish-water fishes, feeding on vegetable growths
and minute shell-fish. They also suck up large quantities of sand into the
mouth for the sake of the minute organisms contained therein; much of this
is passed on into the stomach, which is thick and muscular, like that of
many birds. Altogether some seventy species of grey mullets are known, the
majority of which attain a weight of about 4 lbs., but there are many which
grow to 10 or 12 lbs. All are eaten, and some highly esteemed.

The FLUTE-MOUTHS, STICKLEBACKS, and TORTOISE-FISHES are three closely
allied and extremely interesting families. The first are really gigantic
marine sticklebacks, in which the jaws are produced into a long tube. They
are shore-fishes, entering brackish water, and confined to sub-tropical and
tropical parts of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.

RED MULLET.

Not related to the Grey Mullets, this species is placed here for the sake
of contrast.]

Of the STICKLEBACKS there are several species, some of which are entirely
salt-water fishes, whilst others enjoy the rather unusual distinction of
being able to live in either fresh or salt water, even when rapidly
transferred from one to the other. The small species commonly inhabiting
ponds and ditches can sustain changes of this kind with impunity. These
last are very ferocious. One kept in an aquarium devoured in five hours
seventy-four young dace about a quarter of an inch long. They occasionally
occur in vast shoals, and, according to the naturalist Pennant, appear in
the river Welland, in Lincolnshire, once in seven years in amazing shoals,
so that a man employed in collecting them earned four shillings a day by
selling them at the rate of a halfpenny a bushel!

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

GARPIKES.

Frequently called Guard-fishes.]

The salt-water species, or FIFTEEN-SPINED STICKLEBACK, is less well known.
Like its fresh-water relative, it is a nest-builder, and the male defends
the eggs and young with great courage.

The TORTOISE-FISHES may serve as the representatives of the last family of
this group. They are very remarkable fishes, being invested in a wonderful
bony cuirass, formed by a modification of the skeleton, similar to what has
taken place among the Tortoises and Turtles. The body is so thin that it
looks as if it had been artificially compressed, and is semi-transparent.
Three species are known from the tropical Indo-Pacific and three from other
seas; besides these are four smaller and less perfectly armed forms, one of
which, the TRUMPET-FISH, or BELLOWS-FISH, occurs rarely off the south coast
of England.

THE GARPIKE and FLYING-FISHES are both interesting, especially the latter.
The garpike is represented by several species, easily recognised by the
long, pointed jaws. These fishes are furthermore peculiar in that the bones
are green, a colour which remains even after cooking, and on this account
some object to eating them, supposing the unusual colour to indicate
unsoundness. The elongated jaws are not developed in the young fish, and,
strangely enough, as this character is acquired, the lower jaw grows faster
than the upper. In some species the lower jaw remains permanently the
longer; hence they are known as HALF-BEAKS.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

PIPE-FISH.

The Flute-mouth, as this fish is often called, is really a gigantic
stickleback.]

The FLYING-FISHES, or FLYING-HERRINGS, like the Flying-gurnards already
noticed, are enabled, by reason of the great development of the
breast-fins, to take extended journeys through the air. The flight of these
fishes is, however, not quite the same as true flight, inasmuch as the fins
serve mainly as a parachute, and do not, by sustained vigorous movements,
propel the body through the air, like the wings of bats and birds. Darting
out of the water when pursued by an enemy or frightened by a passing
vessel, these fish are borne along by the wind, the speed at first being
very considerable, exceeding indeed that of a ship going ten miles an hour.
At a single flight they may cover as much as 500 feet, but are quite unable
to steer themselves, except when, during their course, the tail-fin is
immersed in the water, when by a stroke from one side to the other the
direction may be changed from left to right, or _vice versâ_, as the case
may be. By day they will avoid ships, but by night, when they are unable to
see, "they frequently fly," writes Dr. Günther, "against the weather-board,
where they are caught by the current of air and carried upwards to a height
of 20 feet above the surface of the water, while under ordinary
circumstances they keep close to it."

FLYING-FISH.

More than forty distinct species of this family are known.]

CHAPTER VI.

_THE WRASSE-LIKE FISHES._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S. F.Z.S.


The members of the four families noticed in this chapter are remarkable for
their wonderful coloration. The species of the first family, from their
peculiarly striking resemblance to the Scaly-finned group, share with them
the name of CORAL-FISHES. This resemblance is a very remarkable one.
Occurring, like the Scaly-fins, more abundantly in the neighbourhood of
coral-reefs, they also resemble the latter not only in shape, but also in
coloration, the same pattern being often common to members of both
families.

To this family belongs the remarkable fish known as the AMPHIPRION, which
makes its home in the interior of an enormous species of sea-anemone
measuring 2 feet across. When first discovered by Mr. Saville-Kent, it was
believed that the fish had been swallowed--a view, however, which was
speedily rejected, when it was found that, if ejected by means of a stick,
it invariably returned. Thus the anemone is obviously to be regarded as
host, and not as captor. More than this, from the facts so far to hand, it
appears that this strangely assorted pair are mutually dependent on one
another, at least to a large extent--the fish undertaking to supply the
larder, whilst the anemone in return affords shelter from enemies. The part
played by each is as follows:--The fish, which is very conspicuous, wearing
a livery of vermilion crossed by three bands of white, sallies forth and
swims about till it attracts the attention of some other carnivorous member
of its class, on which, if it gives chase, the amphiprion returns with all
speed to its living cave, and quickly disappears down its mouth. The
pursuer, blundering against the outspread tentacles, is immediately
paralysed by a shower of stinging-darts which proceed therefrom as a result
of the shock, and, rendered insensible, becomes the spoil of both. Thus the
active fish plays the part of a lure, and in return is afforded shelter.

[Illustration: _Photo by Reinhold Thiele & Co._]     [_Chancery Lane, W.C._

SPOTTED WRASSE.

On account of their greatly thickened lips wrasses are also known as
Lip-fishes.]

The WRASSES proper may be distinguished, amongst other things, by their
thickened lips--hence the name Lip-fishes given them by German
naturalists--by the greatly extended back-fin, the greater part of which is
spinous, and the arrangement of the teeth, which need not be discussed
here. They are shore-fishes, living in the neighbourhood of weed-covered
rocks, or in tropical seas, where they are most abundant, amid coral-reefs.
Most are brilliantly, many gaudily coloured, iridescent hues frequently
adding to the beauty formed by the permanent deposit of coloured pigments
in the scales. Some grow to a large size, specimens not seldom exceeding a
weight of 50 lbs., and these are the most esteemed as food-fishes, the
smaller species, as a rule, being regarded as of inferior quality.

A well-known British species is the STRIPED or RED WRASSE, the sexes of
which exhibit a remarkable variation in colour, the male having the body
marked with blue streaks or a blackish band, whilst the female has two or
three large black blotches across the tail. A second British species, the
BALLAN WRASSE, is bluish green in colour, with the scales and fin-rays
reddish orange. It may be found hiding in the deep gullies among rocks,
sheltering in the dense clusters of seaweed, and feeding on crabs and
shrimps. It takes a bait freely, and fishermen have remarked that at first
they catch few but large fish; some days later a great number may be
caught, but all will be of small size, indicating that the larger fish
assume the dominion of a district and keep the smaller at bay.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SATIN PARROT-FISH.

The Parrot-fishes, or Parrot-wrasses, are so called on account of the
peculiar structure of the teeth in the front of the jaws, which form a
sharp-edged beak.]

Amongst the most brilliantly coloured of the wrasses are the PARROT-FISH.
Mr. Saville-Kent, writing of the species which inhabit the waters of the
Great Barrier Reef of Australia, remarks that to stand up to your knees or
higher in water, with such a shoal of magnificent fishes swimming round
you, is an experience well worth a journey to the tropics. The coloration
of these fishes, which is extremely transient, fading almost immediately
after death, nearly defies description. One of the most beautiful is
perhaps the GOLD-FINNED CORAL-FISH, in which the body is of an intense
ultramarine, whilst the fins are bright golden. Others have the most
amazing combinations of green, vermilion, blue, and yellow, in endless
variety. It was one of the parrot-fishes which found such favour with the
ancients. "In the time of Pliny," writes Dr. Günther, "it was considered to
be the first of fishes ... and the expense incurred by Elipentius was
justified, in the opinion of the Roman gourmands, by the extreme delicacy
of the flesh. It was a fish, said the poet, whose very excrement the gods
themselves were unwilling to reject. Its flesh was tender, agreeable,
sweet, easy of digestion, and quickly assimilated; yet, if it happened to
have eaten an aplysia, it produced violent diarrhoea." To this day the
Greeks hold it in high regard, and eat it with sauce made of its liver and
intestines. It feeds on seaweed, and from its habit of thoroughly chewing
its food, and moving it backwards and forwards in the mouth, it was at one
time believed that this fish chewed the cud after the fashion of the
ruminating mammals!

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BLACK-SPOTTED PARROT-FISH.

The flesh of some of the Parrot-wrasses is of great delicacy.]

One of the most interesting of all the wrasses is a small species from King
George's Sound, which, while retaining the principal characters common to
the group, has assumed the general shape and proportions of the pipe-fish.

The third family of the wrasses are remarkable chiefly on account of the
fact that they produce their young alive. These fishes are confined to the
temperate regions of the North Pacific.

The CHROMIDS constitute the last family of the wrasse-like group. Numerous
in species, they are all dwellers in fresh-water. One species occurs in
amazing numbers in the Lake of Galilee, shoals over an acre in extent, and
so closely packed that movement seemed almost impossible, having been
recorded. They are taken in such enormous numbers that the nets in which
they are caught often break. Occasionally shoals are carried down the
Jordan into the Dead Sea; but the fish never get farther than a few yards,
becoming stupefied almost at once, and, turning over on their backs, fall
an easy prey to flocks of cormorants and kingfishers. Heaps of putrefying
carcases are washed ashore, poisoning the atmosphere, in spite of the
presence of flocks of ravens and vultures which have gathered to the feast.

[Illustration: _Photo by H. V. Letkmann_]     [_New York._

A WRASSE.

The majority of the Wrasses are brilliantly coloured.]

Another species is remarkable for its peculiar method of protecting the
eggs and young. The female deposits the eggs, over 200 in number, in a
small hole worked out among the roots of reeds and rushes. There they are
taken into the mouth of the male one by one, and retained till hatched a
few days later. The young fry remain in this nursery for some considerable
time, increasing rapidly in size, so that the father-nurse is unable to
close his mouth. Some of the young develop among the gills; others lie,
closely packed, with their heads turned towards the mouth of the parent,
remaining in this position till nearly 4 inches long, when they are ejected
or wriggle out to forage for themselves.

CHAPTER VII.

_PIPE-FISHES, SEA-HORSES, GLOBE-FISHES, SUN-FISHES, AND THEIR ALLIES._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, F.L.S., F.Z.S.

The fishes described in the present chapter form two well-marked groups,
known as the TUFT-GILLED and the COMB-GILLED FISHES, on account of the
peculiar arrangement of the gills, or breathing-organs; they are also
remarkable for their peculiar shapes. The breast-fins are present in all;
but in three of the families the second pair of fins, corresponding to the
hind limbs of the higher animals, are wanting.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

GLOBE-FISH.

From the formidable armature of spines, known also as the Sea-hedgehog.]

The TUFT-GILLED FISHES are represented by two families--the MAILED
TUBE-MOUTHS and the PIPE-FISHES and SEA-HORSES, all of which have undergone
very considerable modification of form, the body being encased in mail-like
armour, whilst the jaws are toothless and produced into a long tube.

The first family is composed of a few small fishes from the Indian Ocean.
Grotesque in appearance, they are remarkable also for the fact that the
female takes sole charge not only of the eggs, which are exceedingly
minute, but the young fry also. Only one other fish is known in which the
care of the eggs and young is undertaken by the female: this is one of the
Cat-fishes, described in a later chapter. The eggs in the TUBE-MOUTHS are
carried in a pouch formed by the union of the inner borders of the ventral
fins, which are long and broad. For the retention of the eggs within the
pouch its wall develops long filaments, which serve the purpose of slender
fingers.

The second of these families contains the PIPE-FISHES and SEA-HORSES. They
are small marine fishes, inhabiting the seas of tropical and temperate
regions wherever there is sufficient vegetation to offer shelter, for they
are peculiarly defenceless creatures. They possess but feeble powers of
swimming, and consequently are not seldom borne away by strong currents far
out to sea or on to distant shores. Their method of locomotion is, indeed,
quite different from that of other fishes, as they progress neither by
undulatory motions of the body nor by powerful strokes of the tail, but by
wriggling in the case of the pipe-fishes, or vibrating motions of the
back-fin in the sea-horses.

The long, semi-cylindrical PIPE-FISHES, partly on account of their peculiar
form and colour, and partly on account of their swaying motions, so closely
resemble the fronds of seaweed amongst which they dwell as to pass
unnoticed by their enemies. Unlike the Tube-mouths, just described, the
care of the eggs and young devolves upon the males. The young are borne in
a pouch, but, ventral fins being wanting, this is formed by a fold of skin
developed from each side of the trunk and tail, the free margins being
united in the middle line. Here the eggs remain till they are hatched. But
the pouch is by no means done with after this event, for the young continue
to occupy it for some time, returning when danger threatens--a habit which
recalls the custom of the young of the kangaroo. Mr. Yarrell relates a
curious fact which he gleaned from some fishermen--to wit, that if they
take a pipe-fish, open the pouch, and drop the young into the sea, they
will not disperse, but hover around the spot, as if waiting for their
parent. Then, if the newly opened fish be held in the water, the young
immediately return and enter the pouch. In another species of pipe-fish the
eggs, instead of being carried in a pouch, are held by a sticky secretion
to a groove in the under surface of the parent. This groove would seem to
indicate the beginning from which the complete pouch has been developed.
The pipe-fishes swim in a very peculiar manner, holding the body now in a
vertical, and now in a horizontal position, accompanied by contortions of
every conceivable kind, poking their long snouts into bunches of seaweed in
search of food as they go.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BLACK-SPOTTED GLOBE-FISH.

Globe-fishes possess the power of inflating the body with air, when they
float at the surface, and thus escape enemies.]

[Illustration: _Photo by N. Lazarnick_]     [_New York._

TRIGGER-FISH.

A well-known member of the File-fishes.]

The SEA-HORSES have a still more eccentrically modified form, inasmuch as
the body is thrown into a series of curves, the head being bent upon the
trunk in a manner suggestive of the head and neck of the horse; hence the
name of the group. The tail, which lacks the membranous portion, or fin,
can be spirally coiled, and is used as an organ of prehension, and on this
account is unique amongst fishes. Gripping the stems of seaweeds with this
tail, and swaying the body to and fro among the vegetation, the fish is
rendered comparatively inconspicuous, the lines of the body being broken up
by numerous more or less filamentous processes, which in one species, the
FUCUS-LIKE SEA-HORSE, become excessively developed, forming long,
frond-like blades. These, streaming in the water, both by their shape and
coloration render the resemblance to the vegetable growths in which the
animal hides so perfect that detection is almost impossible. Thus they
furnish one of the most remarkable examples of adaptation to the
environment amongst living animals. The males of most sea-horses, like the
pipe-fishes, carry the eggs and young in a pouch on the abdomen, but in the
species just mentioned the eggs are embedded in the soft skin on the under
surface of the tail.

Sea-horses swim with the body more or less vertical, the motive power being
supplied by rapid vibration of the back-fin. Both pipe-fishes and
sea-horses occur in British seas, the first being the more common.

[Illustration: _Photo by H. V. Letkmann_]     [_New York._

COFFER-FISHES.

Coffer-fishes have the body encased in a hard shell of closely fitting
plates, leaving only the tail and fins free to move.]

The COMB-GILLED FISHES, to which we come next, are divided into two
families, whose members are as remarkable for their extraordinary shape as
are the tuft-gilled forms just discussed. The abnormal shapes which mark
out certain fishes so conspicuously from the more normal and typical forms
are generally regarded as adaptations, serving to ensure concealment, to
ward off attack, or to effect the capture of prey otherwise unattainable.
Instances illustrating all three of these ends are furnished by these two
groups of the tuft- and comb-gilled fishes.

The FILE-FISHES and COFFER-FISHES, which form the first of the two
families, present considerable variation in shape as well as in the
covering of the body, which may be naked, covered with rough scales or bony
spines, or invested in a complete bony cuirass.

The file-fishes are represented by numerous species, the typical one being
known also as the TRIGGER-FISH, on account of an armature of spines on the
top of the back. These spines are three in number; the first is very
strong, roughened like a file--hence the name File-fish--and hollowed out
behind to receive the second much smaller spine, which has a projection in
front at its base, fitting into a notch in the first. Thus these two spines
can only be raised or depressed simultaneously, and the first cannot be
forced down unless the second has been previously depressed. These fishes
have very powerful teeth, to break off pieces of coral, which form a large
part of their diet. They also destroy a large number of shell-fish, and
work great destruction amongst pearl-oysters. Frequently these fishes, when
eaten, prove highly poisonous, from having fed on poisonous corals,
jelly-fish, or decomposing substances.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SPOTTED BOX- OR TRUNK-FISH.

In this species of Coffer-fish the arrangement of the plates forming the
hard cuirass can be plainly seen.]

As a rule file-fishes are of small size, but some attain a length of 2
feet, and many are beautifully and symmetrically marked.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SEA-HORSES.

The species on the right is remarkable for the development of long
leaf-like processes all over the body, causing the fish to bear a very
close resemblance to the seaweed amongst which it dwells.]

The COFFER-FISHES derive their name from the box-like cuirass in which they
are invested. This is formed by numerous closely fitting, hexagonal bony
plates, forming a mosaic, and leaving only the fins and hind part of the
tail free. This bony case varies greatly in form, in some species being
three-ridged, in others four- or even five-ridged; while in some long horns
are developed, making the defensive armature still more complex. More than
twenty species are known, all confined to tropical and sub-tropical seas.

The GLOBE-FISHES and SUN-FISHES constitute the last family of this really
extraordinary assemblage. The covering of the body consists either of
minute scales or large spines, which can frequently be raised or depressed
at will. All the members inhabit tropical or sub-tropical seas, and a few
occur in the fresh-waters of the same regions.

The GLOBE-FISHES have short, thick bodies, covered either with small
spines, as in the TOAD-FISH, or very large ones, as in the PORCUPINE-FISH,
or SEA-HEDGEHOG. They are remarkable for their habit of filling the gullet
with air, and then distending the body to an enormous size. This device
enables the fish to escape its enemies; for when so inflated it rises to
the surface and floats belly-upwards, and, the inflated portion projecting
above the water, the fish is blown along by the wind to more secure
regions. The more heavily armed species become still more formidable when
inflated, as the spines are then fully erected. Escaping from enemies below
by flight, they are thus secure from enemies above by reason of their
armature. Globe-fishes have been found floating alive and unhurt within the
stomachs of sharks which had swallowed them, and one has even been known to
eat its way out through its captor's side, and so killing its would-be
devourer! When a globe-fish desires to return to its normal elongated
shape, it expels the air from the gullet through the mouth and gills, the
expulsion causing a curious hissing sound.

Extremely unlike the foregoing members of the group of comb-gilled fishes,
the SUN-FISH is nevertheless quite as remarkable in form, looking as if it
had undergone the amputation of its hind parts. The singular shape of the
other members of the comb- and tuft-gilled fishes are undoubtedly
adaptations to avoid enemies, either by rendering the animal inconspicuous,
or hurtful by reason of its powerful armature. The form of the sun-fish
appears to be an adaptation for the capture of food, as this fish preys
largely upon the fry of other fishes which inhabit enormous depths, and
consequently can only be obtained by diving. Sun-fishes inhabit the
surface-waters, but as divers have few equals.

A SALMON LEAPING.

The height to which salmon will leap in ascending a waterfall is little
short of marvellous. When the fall is very high the ascent is often
accomplished in a series of leaps, the fish resting in pools of
comparatively still water.]

CHAPTER VIII.

_THE COD FAMILY._

BY JOHN BICKERDYKE, M.A.

The large and important Cod Family belongs to the order of Spineless Fishes
and the group in which both sides of the head are symmetrical. The Common
Cod, the Whiting, the Haddock, the Pollack, the Coal-fish, the Hake, the
Ling, and the little Rocklings, all belong to this important family, which
has one representative in fresh-water, the Burbot, or Eel-pout, found in
various rivers in Central and Northern Europe and North America.

Perhaps the most remarkable member of the Cod Family is the CHIASMODUS,
which has huge jaws lined with large pointed teeth, and a distensible
stomach and abdomen. During the _Challenger_ Expedition a specimen was
taken 1,500 fathoms down in the North Atlantic. It had swallowed another
fish, a kind of scopelus, more than twice its own size. The stomach of the
chiasmodus had swelled to an enormous extent, and had become so thin from
distension that the fish inside could be clearly seen through its walls.
The scopelus, it is interesting to mention, is a fish brought up sometimes
by the dredge from 2,500 fathoms. It occasionally comes to the surface at
night, and has phosphorescent spots along its sides, giving out a dim
light, which has its uses in the dark depths of the sea.

To come back to the head of the family, the COD is a fairly plentiful fish
all around the British and Irish coasts, but appears to be decreasing in
some waters as time goes on, owing to the over-trawling of the North Sea.
Off the coasts of Norway, in the neighbourhood of the Lofoden Islands, the
cod are sometimes so thickly packed in shoals that as the fishermen lower
their tackle they can feel the leads hitting the backs of the fishes. Both
there and off the Faröe Islands and Iceland it is common practice to fish
with a hook bearing a little piece of polished lead on its shank, no other
bait being required, owing to the cod being so numerous that food is
scarce.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

WHITING.

Easily distinguished from the cod by the absence of a barbel on the chin.]

About the commencement of the fifteenth century the English began to go to
Iceland for cod, and since the sixteenth century English cod-fishing
vessels have visited Newfoundland and other far northern waters, which
produce fish superior to English cod. It should be mentioned that the Cod
Family is not found to any extent in tropical seas.

While the BURBOT is one of the few species of the group inhabiting
fresh-water, and is peculiar in living there permanently, there are
instances recorded of POLLACK having ascended from the salt water of the
Norwegian fjords into fresh-water lakes, and it is an undoubted fact that
many other species of sea-fish can accustom themselves to a residence in
fresh-water.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

POLLACK-WHITING.

A British representative of the group in which the lower jaw is the longer
and all the teeth of the upper jaw are of equal size.]

All through the year cod frequent the British coasts; but it is two or
three months before the spawning-season, which commences in January or
later according to the locality, that they gather in vast shoals and come
close inshore. First come the small codling of a pound or so, and as the
winter approaches the longshore fish are found gradually to increase in
size, until by Christmas-time it is no uncommon thing on the east coast of
England and Scotland for fish of from 10 to 20 lbs. to be caught from the
beach.

As a rule the eggs of cod float, owing to a little globule of oil which
each one contains, but in water which lacks salinity they sink. The
quantities of eggs shed by each fish are enormous; nearly two millions were
counted in a cod of a little under 12 lbs. It is fairly certain, however,
that not more than two or three, if so many, mature fish are the product of
the two million eggs; for if each fish even doubled itself in numbers (if
we may use the expression) every year, the sea would soon contain more fish
than water. Millions upon millions of eggs are destroyed when there is an
on-shore wind during the spawning-season. Sometimes the shore on which they
have been wafted has been seen to glisten with them.

By the end of summer such of the young cod-fish as have escaped their many
dangers attain about 1 inch in length. They are very varied in colour,
which depends on that of the seaweed and their other surroundings. The
parent fish, too, vary somewhat in appearance, those round the English
coast as a rule having brown backs with irregular spotty markings on the
sides, while those from more northern waters usually have darker backs and
are less often spotted. Cod are most enormous feeders, and in consequence
grow very rapidly. At the Southport Aquarium codling of only ¾ lb.
increased in weight to 6 or 7 lbs. in about sixteen months.

So voracious is the cod that it is very apt to swallow anything it sees
moving, without considering whether it is wholesome. In 1879 a black
guillemot in perfect condition was removed from the stomach of one of these
fish; while among other strange finds by cod-fishermen from the same
receptacle was a piece of tallow candle 7 inches long, a hare, a partridge,
a white turnip, and, going back to the year 1626, a "work in three
treatises," which was found in the stomach of a fish captured in Lynn Deeps
on midsummer eve, and brought to the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge. The
usual food of cod is, however, small fish of various kinds--herrings,
pilchards, sprats, crabs, and sea-worms; but the species is not particular
what it seizes when shoaling before the spawning-season and food is scarce
owing to the number of mouths.

CHAPTER IX.

_CAVE-FISHES, SAND-EELS AND THEIR ALLIES, AND FLAT-FISHES._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

The subterranean fresh-water caves of Cuba furnish the most interesting and
most remarkable members of the family in certain small fishes known as
CAVE-FISHES. Living in complete darkness, the eyes have degenerated so as
to be no longer useful as organs of sight; indeed, in many species they are
entirely wanting. By way of compensation delicate organs of touch have been
developed, taking the form, in different species, of barbels, hair-like
processes, or tubercles. These blind fishes are closely allied to certain
marine forms found in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and it is
curious to note that amongst these about seven very rare species are found
at great depths in the southern oceans, so great that light fails to reach
them, and they too are blind.

The SAND-EELS, or LAUNCES, are extremely common on the sandy shores of
Europe and North America, living in vast shoals, and displaying a wonderful
unison in their movements, rising and falling as with one accord. They
burrow in the sand with amazing rapidity, forcing their way by means of a
horny projection on the lower jaw, and remaining buried at ebb-tide some 5
or 6 inches under the sand, when they are captured by fishermen, armed with
rakes, for bait. When swimming in shoals, their presence is often betrayed
by schools of porpoises, which feed greedily upon them, preventing their
return to the bottom by getting under the shoal, whilst others swim round
it. Mackerel also make large raids upon the ranks of such shoals.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

HALIBUT.

The largest member of the Flat-fish Family. The back-fin usually commences
much farther forward.]

FLAT-FISHES may be reckoned among the most important of food-fishes, and
besides are of quite peculiar interest, on account of the remarkable
modifications of structure which they have undergone. They differ from all
other vertebrates in that, save for the first few weeks of existence, they
spend the whole of their lives with one side of the body uppermost--the
right or left, according to the species. Whether resting or swimming, this
position holds good. The newly hatched fish, however, maintains the normal
poise of the body, the back being uppermost. Of the many changes which the
organs of the body undergo during this strange transformation from a
"round" to a "flat" fish, one of the most interesting is that which
concerns the eyes. These, in the very young fish, lie one on either side of
the head; but as the fish grows older it begins to lie on its side on the
ground, and ultimately, when it is two or three months old, loses the power
of sustaining itself in an upright position altogether. The most remarkable
feature in this very strange mode of development is, that as the fish comes
to lie more and more on its side, so the eye which is undermost begins to
move round to the other side, till eventually the two eyes lie side by side
on the upper-surface. Strangely enough, in some species the eye moves
_round_ the head, passing over its edge, and so to its place beside the
stationary eye, whilst in others it acquires its ultimate position by
moving _through_ the head, sinking in on one side and appearing again on
the other. The coloration of these fishes is also peculiar, in that the two
sides are quite differently coloured, the upper side resembling in tone
that of the sea-bottom, whilst the under side is pure white. In the young
fish, before the habit of lying on one side has been acquired, both sides
are coloured alike. The difference in coloration between the two sides of
the adult fish appears to be due to the effect of light, since in
flat-fishes kept in a tank with a mirror at the bottom the under-surface
was found in many cases to be very largely coloured. But the colour of the
upper-surface is by no means constant. On the contrary, the flat-fish
appears to possess the power, in common with all other fishes, of changing
its colour so as to harmonise with the tone of its surroundings. Thus on a
light sandy ground the exposed surface of the body becomes pale, while on a
dark muddy bottom it is almost black. By this power of changing the colour
of the exposed portion of the body so as to harmonise with the
surroundings, the fish is enabled to become in a large measure invisible,
and in proportion to the effectiveness of the change to escape its enemies.
Some soles are quite invisible.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BRILL.

As in the turbot, the eyes are on the left side of the head, instead of on
the right side, as in the halibut.]

The most important of the flat-fishes are the PLAICE, FLOUNDER, DAB,
HALIBUT, SOLE, TURBOT, and BRILL.

The PLAICE is one of the commonest of the British flat-fishes, and may be
distinguished by the numerous orange or red spots which are scattered over
the upper surface of the body. From 15 to 18 inches in length, specimens
are occasionally captured which have attained a length of 28 inches. Plaice
feed on shell-fish, such as mussels or scallops, which they crush by means
of strong, blunt teeth in the throat; but worms are also eaten.

The eggs of the plaice are amongst the largest fish-eggs known.

The FLOUNDER is a smaller fish than the plaice, and lacks the red spots. It
differs from the other flat-fishes in the preference it shows for the
mouths of rivers, ascending these, indeed, so far as to enter fresh-water.

The HALIBUT is the largest of the flat-fishes, specimens of as much as 20
feet in length being on record, while examples of from 6 to 7 feet long are
not uncommon in Grimsby market. This fish has a wide distribution,
occurring on both sides of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, being most
abundant in deep water. The halibut which are brought into the markets of
Grimsby and Hull are chiefly caught off the coasts of Iceland and the
Faröes with long lines.

The SOLE is a shallow-water fish, feeding chiefly upon worms, crabs, and
shrimps. These it apparently hunts by smell, gliding over the sea-bottom,
and tapping with the lower side of its head, which is provided with
sensitive organs of touch in the shape of filaments. By day it conceals
itself by burrowing in the sand, coming out after dark to feed.

The TURBOT resembles the brill, from which it may be distinguished by the
greater breadth of the body in proportion to the length, the absence of
scales, and the presence of large bony tubercles scattered over the
surface. In Great Britain the turbot is most abundant in the English
Channel.

The BRILL closely resembles the turbot not only in general form, but in the
numerical superiority of the females, and in the habits of the young,
which, like the turbot, are surface-feeders and possess an air-bladder.

CHAPTER X.

_EELS AND CAT-FISHES._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

Eels, like flat-fishes, show plainly, in the shape of their bodies, a
remarkably perfect adaptation to their environment. They are burrowing
fishes, passing much of their time buried in the mud, and leaving little
more than the head exposed. In accordance with this habit, the body is very
long and round, and lacks both the hinder paired fins, and scales. When
swimming, the body is propelled by rapid undulations, the movement being
from side to side, it may be remarked, instead of up and down, as in the
"serpentine" movements of snakes.

Whether all the fishes commonly regarded as eels really belong to this
family or not is a moot-point. It is possible that the eel shape has been
independently acquired by unrelated forms as a result of adaptation to a
similar mode of life. But as the group now stands it embraces several
distinct types,--the COMMON FRESH-WATER EELS; numerous marine species, such
as CONGERS, SERPENT-EELS, DEEP-SEA EELS, and PAINTED EELS; and the
fresh-water ELECTRIC EELS.

[Illustration: _Photo by N. Lazarnick_]     [_New York._

EELS.

Two species are shown in this photograph.]

The RIVER-EELS and CONGERS are perhaps the best known, and are also highly
important food-fishes. That they are fishes of comparatively slow growth
seems to be shown by the fact that the common eel takes about four or five
years to attain a weight of between 5 and 6 lbs. The males are smaller than
the females, the greatest length attained by the former being a little over
1 foot 7 inches, whilst the latter may attain a length of nearly 4 feet.
For a long while what is now known to be the female river-eel was regarded
as a distinct species--the SHARP-NOSED EEL. The two sexes have quite
different habits, the smaller males being found mostly in the brackish
water of river-mouths, and rarely above the reach of the tides, whilst the
females ascend the rivers for great distances, thousands finding their way
into isolated ponds, which they reach by travelling overland. Here they
appear to remain till they have reached maturity, when they migrate with
one accord to the sea. Coming down the rivers during the months of October
and November, hundreds are taken in large niches with traps, the mouths of
which are directed up-stream.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

CONGER-EEL.

The females of this species often swallow the males.]

The migration of eels to the sea is for the sole purpose of spawning and
fertilising the eggs, which done, they die. The spawning appears to take
place in extremely deep water, where the young eels pass the earlier stages
of their development. Like the majority of young fishes, the fry are at
first very different in form from the adults, and many have from time to
time been described as distinct species, no suspicion of their true nature
having been aroused. And this is not to be wondered at, for at this stage
they are perfectly transparent and compressed from side to side, so as to
be but little thicker than a sheet of stout paper; the head is ridiculously
small, and only median fins are present. As development proceeds, having
reached a certain maximum size, they, strangely enough, begin to slowly
diminish, growing shorter and at the same time rounder, so that eventually,
by the time the characteristic eel form is attained, they are considerably
shorter than they were at the maximum period of larval life.

By the time the adult eel form has been attained, the larvæ have made their
way to the mouths of various rivers, preparatory to making their ascent,
which takes place between February and May. They are then from 2 to 5
inches long, and perfectly transparent save for a black line inside the
body, running along the spinal cord. The numbers passing up a single river
during this ascent are almost beyond belief. In one of these migrations, or
"eel-fares," upwards of three tons were captured in a single day in the
Gloucester district in 1886, and it has been calculated that more than
14,000 go to make a pound weight. In the previous year the annual
consumption of eels was estimated at a minimum of 1,650 tons, with a total
value of £130,000. Few obstacles seem too great to be overcome in their
ascent, for they will ascend the flood-gates of locks, or even travel
overland if the ground be wet, till a desirable resting-place is found. In
some parts of England these young eels, or "elvers," as they are called,
are salted and made into cakes.

The CONGER-EEL is a marine species, differing from the river-eel, amongst
other things, in its larger head and eyes, and in the arrangement of its
teeth and the large size of the gill-openings. The conger is also greatly
superior in size, examples of between 6 and 7 feet in length and 60 lbs. in
weight being common. The females are larger than the males, and an instance
is on record of a female which was over 8 feet in length and weighed 128
lbs. Congers feed on other fishes, cuttle-fishes, and lobsters, as well as
upon one another, the larger females eating the smaller males.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

CAT-FISH.

Note the presence of barbels, or "feelers," round the mouth]

SERPENT-EELS are confined to tropical and sub-tropical seas, and are
remarkable for their extreme voracity. More than eighty species are known,
some of which are brilliantly coloured.

The DEEP-SEA EELS are represented by numerous species, and dwell at depths
varying from 340 to 2,000 fathoms. In some species the body is remarkably
modified, the mouth being of enormous size, and the stomach capable of
marvellous distension, so much so that eels of this family have been
captured which had swallowed fishes several times their own weight. The
tail in many of the deep-sea eels tapers to a fine hair-like point.

The PAINTED EELS are remarkable for their bright spotted or mottled
coloration, and are of large size, ranging from 6 to 8 feet in length.
Armed with formidable teeth, the larger species are held in no little fear
by fishermen and bathers, attacks from these fishes being by no means rare.
Their distribution is closely similar to that of the Serpent-eels.

[Illustration: _Photo by N. Lazarnick_]     [_New York._

PAINTED EELS FROM BERMUDA.

More than eighty species of these fishes are known.]

[Illustration: _Photo R. Lazarnick_]     [_New York._

CAT-FISHES.

These belong to the unarmoured group.]

The ELECTRIC EEL is an extremely abundant fish in the rivers and lagoons of
Brazil and the Guianas. It is the most powerful of the electric fishes, and
attains a length of 6 feet. The electric organs of this fish are
sufficiently strong to kill by their shock other fishes and even mammals.
The traveller Humboldt is responsible for the statement, now generally
discredited, that the Indians procured this fish by driving horses into the
water, and so provoking such violent discharges from the fish that they
became exhausted and fell an easy prey.

The CAT-FISHES, or SHEATH-FISHES, are an extremely interesting group, one
of the principal characteristics of which is the total absence of scales,
the body being either entirely naked or armed with bony tubercles or
overlapping plates. Another peculiarity of these fishes is the presence of
feelers round the mouth; these, by their delicate sense of touch, enable
the fish to procure its food in extremely muddy water, when the eyes would
be useless. The latter, indeed, in many species are extremely reduced in
size. Many cat-fishes are armed with powerful spines, attached to the body
by a very complicated mechanism. Such spines are capable of inflicting
dangerous wounds, either by the introduction of poison or the violent
inflammation following on the laceration of the wounded part. Some species
have elaborate accessory breathing-organs, enabling them to travel overland
for short distances from one piece of water to another. Other members of
the group possess electrical organs of considerable power; one species
inhabiting the Nile attains a length of 4 feet.

The nesting-habits of the group are exceedingly interesting, some building
nests in which to deposit the eggs; others carry the eggs in the mouth till
they hatch. In one species the care of the eggs is undertaken by the
female, which carries them about embedded in the skin of the under surface
of the body, which at this season becomes very soft and spongy. When the
eggs are laid, she presses them into the spongy skin by lying on them.

The cat-fishes are of world-wide distribution, but only one species, the
WELS, occurs in European waters. It commonly attains a length of from 6 to
9 feet, and occasionally as much as 13 feet. The majority of cat-fishes
inhabit fresh-water, but some are marine.

CHAPTER XI.

_THE CARP FAMILY._

BY JOHN BICKERDYKE, M.A.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

CARP.

The members of the Carp Tribe are vegetable-feeders. They have teeth in the
throat, but none in the jaws.]

The Carp Family, like the Perch group, is one of the largest among fishes.
It includes the Rudd, Roach, Tench, Bream, Minnow, etc., and is divided
into many groups, which again include numerous species found chiefly in the
temperate and tropical parts of the world. Included among these are the
Barbels, of which there are about 200 species, varying from little fishes
of 2 inches to monsters of 6 feet or more in length. Some of the largest
are found in the Tigris; but the Mahseer of India must be regarded as the
king of all the species. In some of the rivers flowing from the Himalaya
Mountains are curious Barbel which have their vent and anal fin in a sheath
covered with large scales. Roach are important members of the Carp Family,
and the Roach group is a very large one, including the various fishes
coming under the term of "white fish" in Germany. The Roach proper is
common all over Europe north of the Alps. In this group is the Ide of the
central and northern parts of Europe, which when domesticated becomes
golden in hue, and is then called the Golden Orf, a pretty fish kept in
many English aquariums. Rudd are found all over Europe and Asia Minor. Of
Tench, only one species is known, the Golden Tench being merely a variety
differing in the matter of colour. The Bream group consists of the Common
Bream, Bream-flat, and the American Bream, or Shiner. Lastly, we may
mention the Bleak group, of which there are fifteen known species in
Europe, East Africa, and the temperate parts of Asia. This list by no means
exhausts the numerous members of the Carp Family.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

GOLD-FISH.

A native of China and the warmer parts of Japan.]

The COMMON CARP is one of the most remarkable fishes which swim. In early
times in England it was extensively cultivated as a food-fish, and in
Germany at the present day is as much domesticated as the sheep, pig, or
ox. The fish-culturists have indeed done extraordinary things with it,
having, for instance, produced a variety with a single row of scales down
each side and sometimes on the back only, called the MIRROR-CARP, or
KING-CARP. There is also the LEATHER-CARP, with no scales at all, which is
much esteemed in Germany.

There is reason to believe that the common carp was originally a native of
the East, and it certainly has been domesticated in China for many hundreds
of years. Thence it is supposed to have been imported to Germany and
Sweden, reaching England some time in the early years of the fifteenth
century. In that curious work the "Boke of St. Albans," published in 1496,
it is said that the carp is a "dayntous fysshe, but there ben fewe in
Englonde, and therefore I wryte the lesse of hym."

China is the home of the GOLD-FISH, a pretty little carp common in that
country and the warmer parts of Japan. The Chinese have distorted Nature
with regard to this fish even more than the Germans have the common carp.
Their most extraordinary monstrosity is, perhaps, the TELESCOPE-FISH, which
has a huge tail and projecting eyes. It is believed that gold-fish were not
known in England before the year 1691.

The carp has many interesting peculiarities. It is an extraordinarily
fertile fish, and one of the most rapid growers in fresh-water. Under the
most favourable conditions it attains a weight of from 3 to 3½ lbs. in
three years. In a pond which is overstocked, carp hardly increase in weight
at all; while, on the other hand, their growth in hot countries is very
much greater than above stated. A fish of from 4 to 5 lbs. may contain, on
an average, from 400,000 to 500,000 eggs; these are spawned in May or June,
and hatched in from twelve to sixteen days, according to the temperature.

The life of this curious fish may be one of extraordinary duration, carp
having been known to attain an age of a hundred years or more. When very
old, they are apt to go blind and develop white marks, due to the growth of
funguses.

In the winter carp either bury themselves in the mud, or lie among the
water-weeds or roots of trees at the bottom. They are vegetarians for the
most part, with no teeth in their mouths, but strong, powerful
grinding-teeth in their throats; they are believed to regurgitate their
food and chew it, somewhat as a cow chews the cud.

With regard to the weight which this fish attains, one of 19 lbs. was taken
at Sheffield Park in 1882. This was exceptionally large; but one still
larger, weighing 21 lbs. 10 ozs., was caught at Bayham Abbey, near
Lamberhurst, in 1870; while one of 22 lbs. was exhibited many years ago to
the Zoological Society. In the German lakes these fish reach a weight of 40
lbs., or even more.

Carp will, however, occasionally eat small fish, and have even been caught
with a salmon-fly.

CHAPTER XII.

_PIKES, ARAPAIMAS, BEAKED SALMON, AND SCOPELIDS._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.

The Pikes are strictly fresh-water fishes, which are extremely voracious,
and grow to a large size. They are met with in most of the fresh-waters of
Europe, Asia, and America; yet they must be regarded rather as a Western
than an Eastern type, since all the known species occur in America, whilst
only one--the Common Pike--is known outside that country. These fishes
capture their prey by stealth--practised, however, not so much by
concealment as by lying suspended in the water, perfectly motionless save
for the movement of the gills, which is barely perceptible. When the victim
comes within reach, it is seized by a sudden rush. The form of the body is
admirably adapted to this manner of feeding, resembling rather a submerged
log than a fish. It is, furthermore, on account of this shape that the name
Pike has been bestowed, since it recalls the "pike" borne by the soldiers
of bygone days.

When on the feed, nothing comes amiss to pike, and the havoc they commit in
trout-streams is enormous. Not only other fishes are devoured, but both the
young and adults of water-birds are frequently seized, and instances are on
record where boys have been attacked while bathing. The mouth of a pike
bristles with teeth, even the roof being thickly covered. These are all
attached by hinges, moving readily backwards towards the throat, so as to
assist the swallowing operation, but preventing any possibility of the
victim's escape.

In Great Britain the pike is held in high esteem by anglers, though as an
article of food it does not find much favour. The females are larger than
the males. The largest specimens attain a length of about 4 feet, sometimes
a little more, and a weight of from 36 to 37 lbs.

[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt_]     [_Washington._

PIKE.

The most voracious of British fresh-water fishes.]

About six species of pike are known, five of which are confined to American
waters. Of these, the one known as the MUSKET-LUNGE, or MUSKINONGE, attains
the same large size as the common pike; the other species are known as
PIKEREL. The immature pike is commonly called a JACK.

[Illustration: _Photo by N. Lazarnick_]     [_New York._

"SERGEANT BAKER."

An edible Australian representative of the group of fishes which, for want
of an English name, are here called Scopelids.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BEAKED SALMON.

Known in New Zealand as the Sand-eel.]

The ARAPAIMAS are large fresh-water fishes, confined to the tropics, their
distribution being practically the same as that of the Lung-fishes; they
are represented in America, Australia, and Africa, but one species occurs
in the East Indian Archipelago. The largest species of all--which is also
the largest fresh-water bony fish known--is found in the rivers of Brazil
and the Guianas, attaining a length of 15 feet and a weight of 400 lbs. It
is highly esteemed as an article of food, being salted and exported from
the inland fisheries to the sea-ports. The natives take it either with a
rod and line, or with a bow and arrow, a line being fastened to the arrow,
thus converting it into a harpoon.

Four species of arapaimas are distinguished by the presence of "barbels" on
the chin; of these, two are Australian, one American, and one occurs in
Sumatra and Borneo. Yet another species is found in the Nile and the rivers
of West Africa. The Australian species, like the large Brazilian form, are
highly esteemed as food; one of these, known as the DAWSON RIVER SALMON, is
confined to the rivers of Queensland, the other to the rivers emptying into
the Gulf of Carpentaria.

The BEAKED SALMON occurs in the open seas of the Cape, Japan, and
Australia; but in New Zealand, where it is known as the SAND-EEL, it is
found in bays with a sandy bottom.

The group of fishes known as SCOPELIDS is one of particular interest, on
account of the number of remarkable forms which it contains. For the most
part they are inhabitants of the open sea, many being found only at great
depths. Of the latter, some apparently come to the surface to feed at
night, whilst others are entirely confined to the abysses of the ocean. As
with the members of other groups which have adopted a deep-sea habitat,
certain modifications of the body have become necessary in these fishes.
Many of them have a direct relation to the absence of light, which has
rendered normal eyes of little use; consequently the eyes of these fishes
have become either greatly reduced or enormously enlarged, or sometimes
lost altogether. As a rule the large-eyed forms are those which come to the
surface at night or do not live beyond the reach of daylight; whilst those
in which the eyes are small or reduced live in the very lowest depths, far
beyond the limit of daylight. In all these forms compensation for the loss
of light has taken place, generally by the development of phosphorescent
organs. These may take the form of a number of luminous areas distributed
down each side of the body, as in the PHOSPHORESCENT SARDINE; or of a pair
of lens-like light-producing organs, occupying the place of the eyes of
other fishes. Another eyeless member of the group, instead of developing
light-producing organs, has increased the length of the rays of the paired
fins to an enormous extent, so that they serve as delicate feelers either
for the discovery of food or the detection of enemies. Many of the fishes
of this group have extremely large mouths, armed with a formidable array of
tusk-like teeth, between which are numerous smaller ones.

As food-fishes the majority of the Scopelids are not of much value. The
species known as the QUEENSLAND SMELT, shown in the adjoining photograph,
is an edible species, occurring off the north-west coast of Australia. Its
near ally, the BUMMALOE, or BOMBAY DUCK, however, enjoys a quite
exceptional notoriety. Salted and dried, it is exported in large quantities
from Bombay and the coast of Malabar, and forms an indispensable adjunct to
an Indian curry. This fish apparently inhabits considerable depths, and
when freshly taken is brilliantly phosphorescent. Another edible species is
the "SERGEANT BAKER" of Australia, of which a photograph is given on page
653.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

QUEENSLAND SMELT.

A near ally of the Bummaloe, or Bombay Duck, that indispensable adjunct to
an Indian curry.]

With regard to the deep-sea Scopelids, it is interesting to note that, in
addition to very remarkable modifications of the eyes and fins, and the
production of phosphorescent light, certain of the body-cavities are
characterised by an intensely black coloration. The inside of the mouth,
the gills, and the lining of the abdomen, for example, are always so
coloured in those fishes which inhabit the deepest abysses. This coloration
is difficult to account for, but it is generally supposed to be due to
excretory products. Another interesting point concerns the air-bladder.
Whenever this organ is present in the fishes of this or any other family
inhabiting the abysses of the ocean, it bursts before the unfortunate
victim is brought to the surface, owing to the enormous differences in
pressure which obtain between the depths of the sea and the surface.

CHAPTER XIII.

_THE SALMON FAMILY._

BY SIR HERBERT MAXWELL, BART., F.R.S.

Although the Salmon Family occupies a low place in the classification of
fishes, yet every member thereof is possessed of singular beauty of form
and colour. The ATLANTIC SALMON, which is the species frequenting European
rivers and those of the eastern coast of North America, may be considered
the type of the family, and certainly it would be difficult to name any
animal more perfectly adapted to its peculiar mode of life, which is one of
constant activity. A native of fresh-water, hatched in early spring from
eggs laid in rivers during the winter months, it spends from fifteen to
twenty-seven months in the shallows of the river, almost indistinguishable
in habits and appearance from a small common trout. Sometimes in the second
spring after its birth, and failing that, always in the third spring, the
fish, having attained the length of 5 or 6 inches, undergoes a wonderful
change: its prevailing tints of olive and gold become overspread with a
glittering coat of silver, known to anglers as the "sea-jacket," and shoals
of "smolts," as they are called in this stage, begin descending to the sea.
In about fifteen or eighteen months, perhaps in some instances longer, they
return to the inland waters as "grilse"--small salmon from 2 to 5 lbs. in
weight. Grilse and mature salmon spawn chiefly in November and December,
undergoing, before they do so, another strange metamorphosis. Their
brilliant silvery scales become darkly discoloured, the males turning
copper-colour, the females blackish and dull purple; their elegant form
becoming distorted to such a degree as to render them hardly recognisable
as the same fish which left the tide in the perfection of beauty. In their
efforts to reach the higher waters where they spawn, salmon display
extraordinary perseverance and activity in surmounting weirs, waterfalls,
and other obstacles which bar their way. After spawning, the fish are
emaciated and lanky, but speedily regain the bright silver hue so
characteristic of the species. In this state they are usually known as
"kelts"; they are worthless either for food or for sport, and make their
way back to the sea, where abundant provender soon restores their
condition. Their chief food consists of herrings, haddocks, and other small
fishes. Dr. Kingston Barton recently recorded finding five full-grown
herrings in the stomach of one salmon. Although the excellence of their
flesh exposes salmon to the attacks of innumerable foes, including man,
predacious fishes, seals, and cetaceans, a few survive for many years and
attain to great size. Fish weighing from 30 to 40 lbs. are far from
uncommon; one of 60 lbs. has been taken in the Tay with rod and line, and
the same river has yielded one of upwards of 70 lbs. to the nets. The fine
sport afforded to anglers by the salmon causes a good beat on a prolific
river to be a very valuable property. Two thousand pounds was the season's
rent paid a few years ago for less than three miles of the Tweed, and the
season happened to be such a bad one that the lessee only killed thirteen
fish!

SALMON-TROUT.

Known also as the Sea-trout, and in Ireland as the White Trout.]

Closely resembling the true salmon in habits and appearance, and sometimes
rivalling it even in size, are two kinds of sea-trout--the SALMON-TROUT,
greatly prized both for its sporting qualities and for the excellence of
its flesh, and the BULL-TROUT, a very inferior fish in both respects.
Bull-trout are not infrequently taken in the Tay weighing upwards of 40
lbs.

The Pacific Ocean has its counterpart to the Atlantic salmon and sea-trout
in several closely allied species, whereof the QUINNAT and the STEELHEAD
are the most notable. These ascend the great rivers of Western North
America in prodigious shoals, penetrating more than 2,000  miles inland to
deposit their spawn. Few of these fish survive to return to the sea. In
their emaciated condition they succumb to exhaustion and starvation; their
corpses, piled to the height of several feet, line the banks of the river
for miles, and contribute nothing to the traveller's comfort. Although
Pacific salmon are of no value to the sportsman, as they are said to refuse
any bait in fresh-water, yet they are the staple of an important trade,
tens of thousands of tons being taken and canned for export.

If we could peer far enough back into the course of time, we should no
doubt be able to identify a common stock from which all the Salmon Family
are descended. That they are all natives of fresh-water is proved by the
fact that they cannot reproduce their kind in the sea. Those that resort to
the ocean for food must be the descendants of vigorous, roving members of
the family, which, having to choose between starvation and migration,
braved the perils of travel, and became so much altered in constitution by
the liberal diet they found as to establish themselves as separate species.

Among the stay-at-homes there are many interesting and beautiful fishes.
None of them exhibit the variable nature of the family more than the common
BROOK-TROUT of British waters, and not long since men of science dignified
each of these varieties by a separate title, treating them as distinct
species. However, experiment and observation have now led to the almost
unanimous conclusion that the pygmy denizens of some hungry Highland burn,
whereof the weight must be reckoned in fractions of ounces, are of
precisely the same species as the lordly trout of deep lakes, which
sometimes scales as much as 25 lbs., and as all the other innumerable
varieties, such as the trout of the Thames, of the English chalk-streams,
and of the Irish loughs. The quality of the soil affects the food-supply,
which in turn regulates the size and appearance of the fish. Moreover,
Nature seems indifferent to the number of individuals composing the
population which the water is to sustain. If there are no pike, and
spawning-ground is abundant, there will be many and small fish; if the
contrary is the case, there will be few and large ones; the aggregate
weight per acre of water will remain the same, proportioned to the
food-supply. The American equivalent of the British brook-trout is the
RAINBOW-TROUT, a beautiful creature which has lately been widely
distributed in European waters. What is known as the brook-trout in America
really belongs to the Char group, fish of the Salmon Family, closely
resembling trout, but distinguished from them by extraordinary brilliancy
of colour. Common trout, like salmon, lose all their beauty as the
spawning-season approaches. Char, on the other hand, take gaudy colouring
at that time, the whole of the under-parts becoming clear red or
flame-colour. Unlike trout, British char never enter rivers, but spawn in
lakes. In Norway, however, char descend to the sea. The distribution of
char is indeed mysterious, nor has any explanation been offered why they
inhabit certain waters, while other lakes in the neighbourhood, apparently
equally suitable, contain none.

The GRAYLING is an elegant member of the Salmon Family, and a deserved
favourite with fly-fishers. Instead of the golden tints and scarlet spots
of the brook-trout, this fish displays the silvery colouring of the
salmon-trout. It is not at all uncommon to meet with grayling in the
chalk-streams of Southern England weighing 3 lbs. and upwards.

The POWAN is the type of another large group of salmon-like fishes,
inhabiting lakes in the temperate and subarctic regions of both
hemispheres. There are four species in Great Britain, among which may be
mentioned the mysterious VENDACE of Lochmaben, unknown to exist elsewhere.

AMERICAN SALMON-TROUT FROM DIAMOND LAKE, NEW ZEALAND.

These fish were taken out of the water to be photographed, and then put
back again.]

Lastly, the Salmon Family is closed by the delicate SMELT, called in
Scotland the SPARLING, which is netted in vast numbers in the estuaries of
suitable rivers. It never ascends beyond the highest point of the tide,
where it deposits its spawn in the spring months. It is a gratifying
tribute to the good work done of late years by the local authorities in
purifying the Thames that, after a long absence, this valuable fish has
reappeared in that river, which it now ascends in considerable numbers as
high as Teddington Weir.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

SMELT.

This fish is remarkable for its peculiar smell when freshly caught, which
resembles that of the cucumber.]

Much discussion has taken place recently with regard to the question
whether salmon feed while in fresh-water. Not long ago it was announced
that they suffered from a diseased condition of the stomach during this
period, and were consequently quite unable to feed. Subsequently it was
found that the supposed diseased condition of the stomach was due to the
fishes not being perfectly fresh when they were examined. It is now known
that although salmon do not feed freely in fresh-water, yet they take a
certain amount of nutriment, such as an occasional shrimp, fly, or even
small fish, while there.

CHAPTER XIV.

_THE HERRING AND ITS KINDRED._

BY F. G. AFLALO, F.Z.S.


"King herring," as the trade-paper of the fishing industry rightly calls
it, is one of the chief commercial fishes of the British seas, and the
enormous North Sea herring fisheries probably support more boats and men
from all parts than any other. Europe has no very large herring; but the
TARPON of the Mexican coast, as well as another giant which occurs in the
northern waters of Australia, grows to an enormous size. All the members of
the Herring Family feed and travel near the surface of the sea, and are
therefore caught in drift-nets, miles of which are "shot" a few fathoms
from the top of the water, catching the shoaling-fish in their meshes. All
of them, too, are wanderers, most capricious in their goings and comings.
Hence the uncertainty of the fisherman's wage.

The principal kinsmen of the herring in British seas are the SPRAT and
PILCHARD, though the two kinds of SHAD, which, like the salmon, ascend
certain rivers for spawning purposes, also support a number fishermen; and
the ANCHOVY is, authorities have lately suspected, sufficiently numerous on
the British coasts to repay a regular fishery, if the men could be induced
to try the experiment and use a sufficiently fine-meshed net for this
little fish.

The HERRING of the more northern waters is larger than that of the English
Channel, 17 inches being recorded as its maximum size in the former, as
against only 12¼ inches farther south. In the Baltic, however, the writer
found the herrings still smaller than those of the English Channel. The
herring lacks the lateral line, already alluded to in other fishes; its
scales are large and thin; its under-edge is smooth and keeled; and the
male is slightly the larger of the two sexes. The SPRAT, on the other hand,
is a smaller species. It has no teeth; its belly is saw-edged; its back-fin
starts nearer the tail than that of the herring. The herring, moreover,
differs from the sprat, and indeed from all our most important fishes, in
that its eggs sink to the bottom. The eggs of almost all other sea-fish
float at or near the surface of the sea, so that the herring's spawn alone
can be damaged by the operations of the ground-sweeping trawl-net. The
shad's eggs also sink to the bottom, but are deposited in the less buoyant
waters of rivers.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

OX-EYED HERRING.

This species attains a length of several feet.]

The PILCHARD, the all-important fish (together with mackerel) on the
south-west coast of England, is of a more decided green hue than either of
the foregoing. Its scales are large and coarse, and its back-fin starts
closer to the head than in the rest. The pilchard of Cornwall and the
sardine of the Mediterranean are one and the same fish in different stages
of growth--that is to say, the pilchard is a grown-up sardine. The late
Matthias Dunn of Mevagissey was one of the first practical fishermen to
accept this identity, and the flourishing sardine factory at his native
town bears lasting witness to his enterprise. Although, from the economic
standpoint, we associate the pilchard with the extreme south-west of the
English Channel, the fish finds its way to more eastern counties. The
writer has found it at both Bournemouth and Ventnor; and it is taken,
though sparsely, in the herring-nets of the North Sea fleets.

The ANCHOVY, smaller than any of the foregoing, may be distinguished by its
projecting, shark-like snout and deeply cleft mouth. It is seen in England
only pickled for table purposes, but the writer used fresh anchovies for
bait almost daily during a stay of four months on the shores of the
Mediterranean.

The two shads--the ALLIS SHAD and TWAITE SHAD--are in some respects, though
less important commercially, the most interesting of the family. Their
habit of coming up rivers to spawn, like salmon, has been already noticed,
but they appear to be more difficult to please than the other fish. The
Severn used to be a noted shad-river, but the fishery has fallen off of
late years. The ALLIS SHAD grows to a weight of 7 or 8 lbs., and its pale
green and silver scales are varied by some darker spots at irregular
intervals on the shoulders and sides. The edge of the belly is serrated,
like that of the sprat. The fish has a curious transparent eyelid, and its
other peculiarities include an abnormally large number of gill-rakers,
through which the water filters much as it does through the "whalebone" of
whales. Its food is said to consist of small fishes and shrimps, as well as
of vegetable substances. Though usually caught, for market purposes, in a
seine-net, which is slipped round the shoal in shallow water, the shad is
now and then taken on the hook, and instances of this are on record in the
neighbourhood of Deal. The rivers of Morocco are very productive of shad,
particularly the BOUREGREG at Rabat, and the UM ERBEYA at Azimur. At the
latter town the writer has bought newly caught shad weighing 5 or 6 lbs.
for native money equivalent to as many pence, and very excellent fish they
proved in camp. The TWAITE SHAD is a somewhat smaller fish, attaining to a
maximum weight of perhaps a couple of pounds. It is not known to differ
materially in habits from the larger species.

Reverting for a moment to the herring as a type of the family, a few words
may be said on some very interesting facts in connection with its
life-history and commercial uses. In the first place, the fact that the
spawn sinks to the bottom is of more importance than would at first sight
appear, since it not only exposes this spawn to disturbance by the trawl,
but also subjects it to the voracity of cod, haddock, and other
ground-feeding fishes. Some little protection is afforded by a natural
provision which enables the eggs to adhere to stones and weeds, but this
cannot in the long-run be of much service against prowling fishes. The eggs
of the shad, which likewise sink (in fresh-water), do not adhere in this
way.

QUEENSLAND LUNG-FISH.

Known also as the Dawson River Salmon, on account of the colour and flavour
of its flesh.]

The migrations of the herring, again, have furnished almost as much
material for argument to marine biologists as the migrations of birds in
ornithological circles. Older naturalists described marvellous Arctic
journeyings with careful attention to detail, much of which is now
repudiated. Later theories hold that the shoals of herrings simply move,
according to changes in the weather and temperature, backwards and forwards
between the shore and the deeper water outside; and so far as the fishermen
are concerned, the mere fact of the fish moving at any season of the year
beyond reach of their drift-nets, which work at only moderate distances
from the land, would be quite sufficient to convince them that the absent
fish had departed on world-wide travels. Much of the former acceptance of
these extensive migrations may have been due to confusion between the
goings and comings of the different races of herrings now recognised by
biologists. It is also probable that, when the identity and movements of
these different "races" are more firmly established, we shall be able to
clear up many of the difficulties at present surrounding the spawning-time
of the herring, and to show that it does not, as sometimes alleged, deposit
its spawn at every season of the year indiscriminately, but that some
herrings spawn at one season, some at another. Although the herring is not,
individually and by comparison with some other sea-fish, an enormously
fertile fish, its numbers must be fairly large, when we bear in mind that
something like 50,000  crans a week are, in good seasons, packed in
Shetland alone. Taking, as an average, 750 fish to the cran, this gives a
weekly curing of not far short of 40,000,000 of herrings in a single
fishery. Owing indeed to the property, already noted, of adhering to stones
and rocks, it is improbable that even the trawl troubles the eggs to any
appreciable extent, as the stony ground on which the herrings generally
spawn is not suited to the operations of the trawler. The spawning and
life-history of the herring are, in fact, the converse of those of the
plaice. The former deposits its eggs on the ground close inshore, and the
young herrings, almost as soon as they are hatched, steer for the open sea
and live near the surface of the water. The flat-fishes, on the other hand,
deposit eggs that float at the surface some distance from the shore; and
the young plaice and soles, when hatched, come inshore and take up their
residence close to the bed of the sea.

AUSTRALIAN PILCHARDS.

Distinct from the British species.]

It would be improper to conclude this account of the Herring Family without
a passing reference to the commercial mixture known as "WHITEBAIT." Until
comparatively late in the last century whitebait was regarded, even by
scientific men, as a distinct species, and there were even some who
declared that they had identified peculiar characters. It is now, however,
common knowledge that the so-called "whitebait" is neither more nor less
than a mixture of young herrings and sprats, the former predominating in
summer, the latter in winter. Other fishes are also found in the dish, and,
appropriately enough, at a recent banquet given by the Worshipful Company
of Fishmongers, at which the writer had the pleasure of "assisting," a
plate of whitebait was found to include no sprats, but the fry of herrings,
gurnards, and sand-eels: this was in the month of July. Whitebait are
caught in special fine-meshed nets in river-estuaries; and although they
make a capital dish for the epicure, the large supplies needed for the
restaurants probably entail a most regrettable sacrifice of valuable
food-fishes, which, if left a year or two, would provide food for ten times
the number of consumers. It would, however, be too much to expect that
epicures should give up such an unrivalled dish for this cause. Moreover,
if these little fishes were not captured by man, it is highly probable that
a large proportion would fall victims to birds or other fishes.

CHAPTER XV.

_BONY PIKE, BOW-FIN, STURGEON, REED-FISH, AND BICHIR._

BY W. P. PYCRAFT, A.L.S., F.Z.S.


The present chapter deals with the remaining forms belonging to that great
assemblage of fishes known as the Bony-mouthed group, which includes all
the members of the class save the Lung-fishes on the one hand and the Shark
Tribe on the other.

This great assemblage, as we have already remarked, is divided into two
sections--the Fan- and Fringe-finned Fishes. The fishes presently to be
described belong partly to the one and partly to the other of these
divisions, and were at one time, together with the Lung-fishes, regarded as
nearly allied, and as forming but a single group, which, on account of the
structure of the scales, was known as the Enamel-scaled group.

The BONY PIKE, the BOW-FIN, and the STURGEON are the last of the Fan-finned
Fishes.

The BONY PIKE, or GAR-PIKE, is an inhabitant of the fresh-waters of North
America, and has the most completely ossified skeleton and the most
perfectly jointed backbone of all the fishes, whilst externally it is
covered with a complete armour of thick, quadrangular scales coated with
enamel. Three distinct species of this family are known, all of which are
of large size, attaining a length of 6 feet. They are carnivorous in their
habits, lying in wait among the reeds, and rushing out to seize their prey
as soon as within range. In the Mississippi, great lakes, and rivers of
South Carolina bony pike are especially abundant, occurring at times in
such numbers as to fill the shad-nets and render the fishery for many days
impossible. The larger members are said to be as aggressive as sharks, and
remarkably tenacious of life.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

BONY PIKE.

One of the very few survivors of the ancient group of Enamel-scaled
Fishes.]

The geographical distribution of the BOW-FIN closely corresponds with that
of the bony pike. It is an extremely common fish, and, though worthless for
food purposes, has yet been deemed worthy of a number of different names,
such as GRINDLE, DOG-FISH, SAWYER, MUD-FISH, and LAWYER-FISH. At one time
it was regarded as a near ally of the Herring Tribe, but modern research
has shown this view to be erroneous. The bow-fin attains a length of about
2 feet, and is very voracious, preying both upon other fishes and aquatic
insects and shrimps. It has a habit of coming frequently to the surface to
breathe, especially when the water is foul, taking in large mouthfuls of
air. When near the surface, it is said to utter a bell-like note, probably
caused by the escape of air from the air-bladder. During the
breeding-season the male takes entire charge of the eggs.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

STURGEON.

The air-bladder of the sturgeon is used for making isinglass, its roe for
caviare.]

The STURGEONS differ from the other fan-finned fishes in many particulars.
To begin with, the skeleton is almost entirely cartilaginous instead of
bony, whilst externally the body is either naked or covered with bony
bucklers, arranged symmetrically. The snout is prolonged into a more or
less shovel-shaped beak, used for turning over the mud at the bottom of the
water in search of prey, and in some forms this becomes further developed
into a spoon-shaped paddle, constituting one of the most remarkable
appendages of fishes.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

STERLET.

A smaller species of the Sturgeon group.]

Sturgeons grow to a large size, and are the largest of the fresh-water
fishes of the northern hemisphere. The GIANT STURGEON of the Black and
Caspian Seas and the Sea of Azoff attains a length of 24 feet, and
sometimes more, specimens of 3,200 lbs. weight having been recorded.

On account of the wholesomeness of their flesh, sturgeons are highly
esteemed wherever they are found. In Russian rivers they are very abundant,
regular fishing-stations being established for their capture. The approach
of a shoal of fish is announced by a watchman, and it is said as many as
15,000  sturgeon have been captured at one of these stations in a single
day. Should the fishing be suspended for a short time, the fish assemble in
such numbers as to form a solid mass, completely blocking a river 400 feet
in width and 25 feet in depth.

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

BICHIR.

A second representative of the Enamel-scaled group.]

From the roe of these fishes caviare is made, and isinglass from the inner
lining of the air-bladder. But the best-flavoured flesh and the finest
caviare are obtained from a comparatively small form, the STERLET, a
species which does not exceed a yard in length. It is common in the Black
and Caspian Seas, the Siberian rivers, and the Danube as far as Vienna.

[Illustration: _Photo by Scholastic Photo. Co._]     [_Parson's Green._

BICHIR.

Note the remarkable finlets on the back and the peculiar structure of the
breast-fins.]

With the Sturgeons we come to the end of the Fan-finned Fishes. The
Fringe-finned group are represented to-day only by the BICHIR and the
REED-FISH. These are extremely interesting forms, if only because they are
the sole survivors of a once numerous tribe, the remains of which occur as
fossils in some of the oldest geological formations. They are known as
Fringe-finned on account of the fact that the rays which support the
fin-membrane in the paired fins are ranged round a lobe-shaped base,
instead of running directly backwards to the body. As in the bony pike, the
body is clothed externally by large quadrangular bony plates of
considerable thickness, and coated with a layer of enamel.

The BICHIR, which is found in the Nile and other tropical rivers of Africa,
is easily recognised by the peculiar structure of the back-fin, which takes
the form of a series of detached finlets, varying in number from eight to
eighteen. The length attained by the bichir is about 4 feet. Gill-breathing
is supplemented by the air-bladder, which is used as a respiratory organ,
the expired air escaping by a slit, known as the "spiracle." The young
bichir breathes, like a tadpole, by means of large external gills,
projecting backwards on each side of the head; later these are replaced by
the more efficiently protected internal gills.

The only surviving relative of the bichir is the REED-FISH of Old Calabar,
which differs by its eel-like form and the absence of the hinder paired
fins.

CHAPTER XVI.

_SHARKS AND RAYS._

BY F. G. AFLALO, F.Z.S.


Two prevalent errors with reference to sharks continually recur in England.
The first is local, and has reference to the absence of "proper" sharks,
whatever that may mean, from British waters. The second, of wider
application, holds that all sharks are dangerous to man. When, some few
years ago, the writer addressed a letter to the Times newspaper, warning
yachting-men against summer bathing in deep water in Cornwall, a host of
critics accused him of a tendency to pose as an alarmist, and insisted that
he was confusing sharks with dog-fish. Apart from the fact that the
distinction between the two groups is in some cases extremely slight--it
does not even rely on size, for there are dog-fishes which attain to larger
dimensions than the smallest sharks--these gentlemen were wholly in error,
since four sharks at any rate are very common in Cornish seas, and even
occur in lesser numbers on other parts of the British coasts. The largest
of these, the great BASKING-SHARK (of which a photograph, taken at
Mevagissey, is given below), illustrates in its harmless person the fallacy
of condemning all sharks as man-eaters, since in this, the largest of its
race, we have an absolutely innocuous fish. From its habit of lying at the
surface with the large back-fin erect, it is also known as the Sail-fish,
while the equally appropriate name of Sun-fish sometimes causes confusion
with other British fishes properly so called.

BASKING-SHARK.

Regularly hunted on the west coast of Ireland for the sake of the oil
obtainable from its liver. Note the keel by the side of the tail.]

A commoner British shark (in the limited space allotted, British species
must be allowed prior claims) is the BLUE SHARK, small examples of which,
weighing 30 or 40 lbs., the writer has often killed with the rod at
Mevagissey. When thus hooked, this fish has a curious and very trying habit
of revolving rapidly in the water, scoring its own granulated skin with the
line. The PORBEAGLE-SHARK, another Cornish species, is of thicker build
than the last, and swims with far less graceful movements. It is a deep
brown colour above, and its general outline may be likened to that of a
torpedo. The FOX-SHARK, or THRESHER, so often seen on hot summer days
leaping out of water among the pilchard-shoals, is easily recognised, even
at considerable distances, by the disproportionately long upper lobe of the
tail-fin. This is the shark which attacks certain of the Whale Tribe. Many
who stay at home find it agreeable to cast doubt on the story; but the
writer has, in Australian seas, witnessed the sight of two of these sharks
flinging themselves on the back of an apparently exhausted whale in such
unmistakable circumstances that the only alternative (which the reader may
accept, if preferred) is to suppose that they were all congenial playmates.

Before specifying some general characters of this interesting group of
predatory fishes, it may be as well briefly to summarise the BRITISH
DOG-FISHES; for the HAMMERHEAD-SHARK, very common in southern seas, is so
rare a visitor to Britain as to be negligible in an epitome of the group.
The dog-fishes, then, which trouble fishermen are the SMOOTH HOUND and
ROUGH HOUND, the NURSE, the PICKED DOG, and the SILVER DOG, or TOPE. The
NURSE and ROUGH HOUND are spotted leopards of the sea, and the latter has a
very curious property. If a fresh-caught "row-hound," as the fishermen
pronounce the name, be put in a basket or boat's well with pollack and
other fishes, the points of contact will be marked by discoloration of its
neighbours. This is probably due to some acrid and bleaching secretion of
the row-hound's skin, for which some economic use might possibly be found.
The PICKED DOG, or SPUR-DOG, has very sharp spines in front of both
back-fins, and has therefore to be handled by the fishermen very
cautiously, often punishing their hands badly when entangled at night in
the nets. Of SMOOTH HOUNDS there are two species or varieties, between
which there is some confusion, and in one at any rate there are interesting
anatomical peculiarities in the unborn fish (like many other sharks and
dog-fishes, the smooth hound bears living young instead of depositing
eggs), any account of which would obviously be out of place in so short a
description.

OCELLATED DOG-FISH.

So called from the presence of the eye-like spots on the body, two of which
can be seen above the breast-fins.]

[Illustration: _Photo by A. S. Rudland & Sons._

INDIAN STRING-RAY.

The tail is armed with a powerful poison-spine.]

Generally speaking, then, the sharks are cartilaginous fishes, having the
upper lobe of the tail larger than the lower, a shovel-shaped snout, and
the crescent-shaped mouth beneath the head. Another peculiar feature of the
group is the presence of breathing-spiracles behind the eyes; while the
latter have a manner of blinking not found in other fishes. Of the teeth,
which differ in structure from those of other kinds of fishes, there are
several rows. The gill-openings are lateral, and usually number five,
though one species has six and another seven. With the exception of the
afore-mentioned BASKING-SHARK and the PORT JACKSON SHARK, which the writer
met with in Australia, they are all more or less dangerous; and when of
insufficient size to be harmful to man, do great damage among the lines and
nets of the fishermen. Indeed, the late Matthias Dunn of Mevagissey
seriously urged on the Admiralty to dynamite them in the interests of the
fishing industry. Most of the sharks deposit their eggs in the curious
oblong vessels known by those who pick up the disused cases on the
foreshore as "purses"; and these attach themselves to rocks and stones by
long tendrils that cling to every support. A number of species (the
PORBEAGLE and TOPE among British kinds), however, bring forth their young
alive.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

HORNED OX-RAY, OR DEVIL-FISH.

This species and its allies attain enormous proportions. One taken at
Barbadoes required seven yoke of oxen to draw it.]

Between the Sharks and Rays there is a curious and interesting link in the
form of the MONK-FISH, or ANGEL-FISH, which is common on all sandy shores,
and a frequent victim of the trawl. Such local names as Mongrel-skate and
Shark-ray indicate a widespread acceptance of its intermediate position
between the two groups under notice. Like some of the sharks already
noticed, it produces living young, and its maximum size may be set down as
at any rate over 7 feet. The writer measured and weighed one trawled in
Bournemouth Bay during the summer of 1896. Its length was nearly 4½ feet,
and its weight rather less than 50 lbs. Like many of the rays, this species
feeds to a great extent on flat-fishes.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

WHIP-TAILED STING-RAY.

Sting-rays are abundant in tropical seas.]

In outward form the monk-fish, though it is in reality more nearly allied
to the sharks, brings us by an easy transition to the flattened RAYS, with
their long whip-like tails and pointed snouts. There are a dozen, or rather
more if we count casual visitors, of these skates and rays in British seas,
the largest being the great EAGLE-RAY, examples of which have been recorded
of the enormous weight of 1,000 lbs. Many of the smaller kinds are studded
with sharp spines, curved in some species, and the THORNBACK owes to these
its trivial name. All these rays, in fact, have some form or other of
formidable offensive and defensive apparatus. The STING-RAY has on its tail
a fearful serrated dagger, 6 or 8 inches long in large examples; while the
TORPEDO- or NUMB-FISH has electric organs in the head, with the aid of
which it can give a shock sufficiently strong to paralyse the fishes on
which it feeds.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SHOVEL-NOSED SKATE.

Known also as the Halavi Ray.]

Two interesting peculiarities of the rays deserve notice in concluding this
chapter. The first is that their egg-purses, instead of attaching
themselves with filaments to weeds and rocks, like those of the sharks, are
provided with a sticky secretion which answers the same purpose of
anchoring them in security from currents that would carry them out into
deep, cold water. The second is the sexual difference in the teeth, which
are pointed in the male and flat in the female. Whether this difference in
the teeth (which may be likened to that between the bills of the male and
female Huia-bird of New Zealand) indicates a corresponding difference in
food, or, on the other hand, some co-operation between the sexes in
procuring it, is an interesting question that our present slight knowledge
of the habits of these fishes does not enable us to answer.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

PAINTED SKATE.

So called on account of its conspicuous coloration.]

Finally, attention must be drawn to the remarkable transformation which the
breast-fins and tail have undergone. The former have developed into
powerful swimming-organs, locomotion being effected by their undulatory
movements, instead of by similar movements of the whole body, or by
side-to-side motions of the tail, as in other fishes. Whilst the latter, no
longer used in swimming, has either been reduced to a mere vestige, as in
the HORNED OX-RAY, or has become developed into a long and tapering
"whiplash," provided with a poison-spine. In such cases the long tail is
used to encircle prey, and at the same time to force the victim on to the
deadly spine.

_BOOK V. JOINTED ANIMALS._

CHAPTER I.

_THE CRAB AND SCORPION GROUPS._

BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.


This section of animals is often called a "sub-kingdom," and differs from
back-boned animals in having the framework of the body outside. That is,
instead of a skeleton, Crabs, Spiders, Centipedes, and Insects are
protected either by a hard shelly casing, or by a tough skin, to which the
muscles are attached; and this arrangement renders them much stronger and
much less susceptible to injury, in proportion to their size, than
vertebrate animals. They have cold blood, generally of a white colour; and
their bodies and limbs are usually composed of a considerable number of
separate joints.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Connold._

BARNACLES.

A species which commonly attaches itself to ships' bottoms and floating
wreckage.]

The group is a very large one, and it is probable that there are at least
300,000 different kinds of insects already known, while the total number of
species now existing is estimated by different entomologists as from two to
ten millions. It is, therefore, no exaggeration to say that every word of
our brief account of the Insects represents from ten to twenty known
species at least. The other classes of the group are also very numerous.
Our account must necessarily be very short; the characters of the principal
classes of the Jointed Animals are referred to in their places.


CRABS, LOBSTERS, SHRIMPS, WOOD-LICE, BARNACLES, ETC.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

A PAIR OF BARNACLES.

The larger size of this photograph exhibits more structural details than
the last.]

Jointed animals are generally provided with one pair of long jointed
organs, called "antennæ," a naturalised word derived from the Latin, in
which language _antenna_ means a sail-yard. They are often called
"feelers," and usually fulfil this function at least; but they are also
frequently organs of smell, and sometimes probably of hearing and other
senses. One peculiarity of the CRAB and LOBSTER group is that they are
generally furnished with two pairs instead of one pair of these organs.


[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

ACORN-BARNACLE.

The general appearance is so different from the Stalked Barnacle that it is
difficult to believe the two belong to the same group.]


They are nearly all aquatic animals, by far the larger portion being
marine, and they breathe with gills. They are provided with a hard
calcareous or horny covering. The head is not separated from the trunk, as
in insects; and they are provided with a number of jointed organs, usually
classified as three pairs of jaws, three pairs of foot-jaws, and five pairs
of legs in the more typical families; but in the smaller and more aberrant
species the number is more variable. In their early stages they frequently
pass through very extraordinary changes of form, but after assuming their
adult shape they grow by casting their shells at intervals.

We will now notice a few typical examples of the different groups of these
creatures.

The BRINE-SHRIMP is a little reddish creature about half an inch long,
which prefers the concentrated solution of brine-pits to sea-water. It has
eleven pairs of legs, and, notwithstanding its name, the front portion of
its body is considerably broader and flatter in proportion than that of a
real shrimp, the other half consisting of a jointed tail.

BARNACLES were formerly considered to be shell-fish, but are now usually
classed with the crabs and lobsters, because, when they are young, they
appear as freely swimming creatures, with one eye, two antennæ, and six
pairs of jointed limbs. When they grow larger, they fix themselves to a
rock or some other object by the head, and develop a shell, usually
composed of several pieces. The commonest is the ACORN-BARNACLE, the white
shell of which, measuring rather less than an inch across, swarms on rocks
at the seaside. It is shaped like a limpet, but open at the top. The
GOOSE-BARNACLES hang down by a stalk, and their jointed shells more
resemble those of a mussel than that of a limpet, though they are composed
of several pieces. Various species similar to both those mentioned are
found on piers, rocks, the bottoms of ships, and even sometimes on the skin
of whales.

In dark cellars in the country, under loose bark, or under pieces of wood
which have been left in the fields, we often see creeping about brown
creatures about half an inch long, with jointed bodies and antennæ, and
short jointed legs. They are called WOOD-LICE, and several species roll
themselves up into a ball when alarmed. These creatures feed chiefly on
decaying vegetable substances; and there is a larger marine species much
like them, which is common in holes and crannies in the rocks on the
seashore.

There are other curious creatures, called WHALE-LICE and FISH-LICE, which
are parasitic in their habits. Some of these look like spiders, and one or
two have enormously long legs; but others are of strange and almost
indescribable forms, and sometimes without legs at all. One species, found
on the sprat, has two long appendages at the end of its body not unlike a
pair of compasses.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S. Regent's Park._

WOOD-LOUSE.

A land representative of a numerous marine group.]

SHRIMPS and PRAWNS are red when cooked, but when alive are very pretty
semi-transparent objects, which may be seen swimming about through the
glass of aquariums placed against the wall. Prawns are larger than shrimps,
and have a strong serrated spine in front of the head. Shrimps and prawns,
of which several kinds are found off the British coasts, generally prefer
shallow water, with a sandy bottom. In most of these the first two pairs of
feet are divided to form a pair of pincers at the extremity; but in such
small creatures this is easily overlooked, unless special attention is
directed to it. It is different with the LOBSTERS and CRAYFISH, which much
resemble shrimps in form, but are very much larger, and armed with a pair
of very large pincer-like claws, in addition to the other legs. Lobsters
live in the sea, in holes in the rocks, into which they dart backwards, and
there protect themselves with only the head and claws projecting at the
opening, ready to face any intruder. Crayfish, which are smaller, live in
holes in the banks of brooks and rivers. There are many species, some of
large size and bright colours. The COMMON LOBSTER is black when living, but
other species are red, blue, or variegated.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

SHRIMP.

A species which plays an important part in the food-supply of London.]

Sometimes, if we pick up a whelk-shell on the beach, we shall find it
inhabited, not by a mollusc, but by a crab, with its legs and claws wedged
together, so as to fill the aperture completely--one claw, much larger than
the other, resting in front; and if we pull it out, we shall find that,
though the front of its body and the legs and claws are hard, like those of
an ordinary crab, it has a long, soft, fleshy tail, absolutely defenceless
and unprotected. Crabs belonging to this curious section are called
HERMIT-CRABS, and protect themselves by taking possession of shells which
they have either found empty or appropriated by the easy and economical
process of devouring the owners. The few species found on the British
coasts are all small, and more frequently noticed in whelk-shells than in
any others; but tropical species attain to a considerable size, and may
sometimes be found in shells measuring 3 or 4 inches across at the opening.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

FRESH-WATER CRAB.

In general appearance very similar to the common shore-crab.]

Crabs are distinguished from the lobsters by their compact form, and by
having the short tail turned in under the body. There are a great number of
species, differing much in size, shape, and appearance. One of the best
known in England is the large EDIBLE CRAB, which may often be seen in
fishmongers' shops, and, unlike the lobster, does not change much in colour
when boiled. Every visitor to the seaside must have seen numbers of the
little greenish SHORE-CRABS, running about on the sand, or over
seaweed-covered rocks, at low tide. These small crabs are harmless, but
large kinds are able to give a very severe pinch. It is related that when
the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy was a boy he used to maintain that pain
was no evil, until a large crab gripped his toe one day when he was
bathing, after which he changed his opinion.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

FIGHTING CRABS.

The males are remarkable for having one large scarlet claw, the other being
rudimentary (the females possess two small claws only). The eyes also are
seated at the end of long stalks.]

Some crabs are smooth and shining, but others are covered with bosses,
excrescences, and spines, which give them a very formidable appearance, and
must be a useful protection against any enemies to whose attacks they are
exposed. In many species one of the two great claws is always much larger
than the other. Some have round bodies, others are oval or nearly square;
some have short legs, and others very long ones. The species differ much in
their habits; and in tropical countries there are land-crabs which live
entirely on shore, and others which are amphibious, and climb
cocoanut-trees to get at the nuts. As a general rule, however, crabs are
carnivorous and marine, and play the part of sea-scavengers.

The KING-CRABS differ very much from any now living in the British seas,
but are generally considered to be allied to the Trilobites, an extinct
family which appears to have been extremely numerous in very ancient seas.
King-crabs are 2 or 3 feet long from the front of the body to the end of
the tail. The front part of the body is entirely covered by a curved oval
shield, while the hinder part of the body is much narrower, and armed at
the sides with strong teeth directed backwards, and also with a long and
strong spear, something like that of a sword-fish on a small scale, as long
as the rest of the body. The few species known exhibit an instance of what
is called "discontinuous distribution," since they are found only on the
coasts of the Moluccas, East Indies, and the Southern United States and
West Indies.


SCORPIONS, SPIDERS, AND MITES.

These creatures form a peculiar group in which there are only two principal
divisions of the body, the head and thorax being fused into one mass, and
the abdomen forming a separate division. In the Mites, however, the body
forms a single round or oval mass, even the division between the thorax and
the abdomen having disappeared. The members of the group have no antennæ,
but two pairs of jaws and a pair of palpi, frequently very long, and armed
with a pincer-like arrangement at the end, in which case they are called
"foot-jaws." Except in some of the mites, which have only four or six, all
the group have eight legs. They pass through no metamorphosis, but moult
several times after quitting the egg before attaining their full growth.
They have frequently several pairs of simple eyes, but no compound eyes
like the large pair on the head of most insects.

In the SCORPIONS, of which there is a considerable variety in different
parts of the world, the united head and thorax are comparatively short; but
the abdomen is very long, and divided into a broad half, consisting of
seven segments, and a narrow tail of five very movable segments, besides a
sharp, curved sting at the extremity. There are from three to six pairs of
eyes on the head and thorax, and in front of the body projects a pair of
very large pincer-bearing foot-jaws. Scorpions are generally of a yellowish
or black colour; and the largest black scorpions of Africa and India
sometimes measure as much as 9 inches in length. They are nocturnal
creatures, hiding under stones, or in holes in the ground, or in crevices
in walls during the day. They kill the insects and other small animals on
which they feed with their stings, the sting of one of the large black
scorpions, like that of the large tropical centipedes, being as painful and
dangerous as that of a snake. There are a few small and comparatively
harmless species found on the shores of the Mediterranean, but most of the
scorpions inhabit warmer countries.

[Illustration: _Photo by Highley._

EGYPTIAN SCORPION.

A fairly large and venomous representative of the group.]

The JOINTED SPIDERS are creatures 1 or 2 inches long, remarkable for having
the head and the segments of the thorax separated from each other, so as to
form distinct divisions of the body. They have rather long and very hairy
legs, and only one pair of well-developed eyes, another pair being
rudimentary. Some species are diurnal and others nocturnal in their habits.
They feed on insects, and sometimes on small birds, etc., and can inflict a
very painful bite. They are found in South-eastern Europe, Africa, Southern
Asia, and from the Southern States of North America south to Chili and
Argentina.

[Illustration: _Photo by Highley._

EGYPTIAN SCORPION.

Shows the sting uplifted for attack.]

The FALSE SCORPIONS, or BOOK-SCORPIONS, are small animals resembling
scorpions in shape, but with no sting, and the abdomen not narrowed into a
tail. They are sometimes found in houses among dusty old books, as well as
out of doors among moss, or under stones or bark. Sometimes they cling to
the legs of flies; they are believed to feed on mites and other small
creatures, but not to injure the flies, only employing them as a convenient
method of being conveyed from one place to another.

[Illustration: Photo by Highley.

TREE TRAP-DOOR SPIDER OF BRAZIL.

Trap-door spiders are plentiful in some parts of Europe, but there is only
one British representative of the family.]

The WHIP-SCORPIONS are not unlike scorpions, and have large claws, but the
front legs are very long, slender, and whip-like, and there is either no
tail, or else a long, slender, whip-like one without a sting. They are
inhabitants of warm countries, and, rightly or wrongly, are reputed to be
venomous. Different species measure from 1 inch to 4 or 5 inches in length.

The curious HARVEST-MEN have two eyes, a small, compact, oval body, large
pincers, and very long, slender legs, longer and more slender in proportion
to their size than those of crane-flies, and equally liable to be broken
off, if the owner is roughly handled. They feed on plant-lice and other
small insects.

We now come to the large and important group of SPIDERS, which more
frequently attract attention in England than any others of the group. The
abdomen is not usually divided into distinct segments, and is connected
with the thorax by a short stalk. Spiders have strong, poisonous jaws,
which make some of the larger species formidable even to man, and several
pairs of eyes; while many possess an apparatus for spinning a strong silken
web, in which they entangle their prey, consisting in England chiefly of
flies and other winged insects.

[Illustration: _Photo by Highley._

HOUSE-SPIDER.

Exhibits the four pairs of legs characteristic of the group.]

The largest known spiders are usually placed first in the series. These are
the great BIRD-CATCHING SPIDERS of South America, some of which have bodies
3 inches long, and strong, hairy legs. These large spiders have now been
proved not only to feed on insects, but occasionally on humming-birds, and
even sometimes on larger birds, such as finches.

The TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS are allied, but smaller, perhaps averaging about an
inch in length. They construct a silken gallery in the ground, with a round
door, which they shut behind them when they enter. There is only one
species in England, which does not form a trap-door, but a silken tube. If
any insect settles on it, the spider clutches it from within, tears a hole
in the tube, drags its prey inside, and then repairs the rent.

Different spiders have many curious methods of capturing their insect-prey.
Some catch insects by running after them, and others by leaping on them,
while those which spin webs are also very dissimilar in their habits and in
their abodes. The brown HOUSE-SPIDERS spin webs in any room left
undisturbed long enough to allow them to construct them. On the other hand,
the ORB-SPINNERS, or GARDEN-SPIDERS, construct elaborate webs out of doors.
One of the most beautiful of these is the DIADEM-SPIDER, which is nearly an
inch long, and of a green or reddish colour, with a white cross bordered
with black on the back. The web is very regularly constructed, the
principal threads radiating in all directions from a common centre, where
the spider generally sits in fine weather, ready to rush out upon any
insect which may become entangled in the web.

The GOSSAMER-SPIDERS spin light webs, which are easily carried up into the
air, and upon which the spiders are borne from one place to another.
Sometimes on an autumn morning the air may be seen to be full of these
floating webs, which also cover the grass and bushes where they have
settled. The WATER-SPIDERS, again, construct a habitation of water-tight
silk under water, like a diving-bell, and inflate it by carrying down
bubbles of air from the surface, entangled in the hairs of the body.

The nesting-habits of many spiders are very curious. The eggs are usually
laid in a silken case, and the RUNNING-SPIDERS may often be seen with the
egg-cases attached to the end of the body, as in the female cockroach.

The males of many spiders are much smaller than the females, and are very
liable to be devoured by their partners.

[Illustration: _Photo by B. H. Bentley_]     [_Sheffield._

GARDEN-SPIDER IN WEB.

A beautiful example of the structure of the web.]

Among the most curious of the group are the SPINY SPIDERS, strange, horny,
semicircular creatures, studded with strong spines. They are allied to the
Garden-spiders, but confined to the tropics.

The SPOTTED SPIDER is a very beautiful species, often seen among cases of
mixed insects, etc., sent from India, It is black, with brown abdomen and
numerous yellow spots, and about 1½ inch long; the body is much longer than
broad, and the legs are about twice as long as the body.

Attempts have been made to turn spider-silk to commercial purposes, but the
great difficulty is that spiders are so voracious and cannibalistic in
their propensities that they cannot be kept in captivity, for they will
kill and eat each other as long as there are any left, to the very last
spider. The silk of some of the large tropical spiders is sometimes strong
enough to cause a man much annoyance when riding through the woods,
striking up against his face, and sometimes knocking off his hat.

[Illustration: _Photo by Highley._

SPANISH TARANTULA.

So called because the bite of an Italian species was supposed to produce a
fit of melancholia, which could only be cured by the tune known as the
"tarentella."]

The last section includes the MITES and TICKS, most of which are small or
microscopic. The whole body forms one round or oval mass, with scattered
hairs, and eight legs, though most mites have only six legs when young,
while the PLANT-MITES have only four. The largest mites are those called
TICKS. There are one or two small British species which are sometimes
sufficiently troublesome; but in many warm countries they are a far more
serious nuisance, lurking on the herbage, and fixing their proboscis in the
skin of any passing man or animal, and retaining their hold till they are
gorged with blood, and allow themselves to drop off by their own weight.

Among the smaller mites some species are parasitic on warm-blooded animals,
causing itch, mange, and other diseases; while many infest insects,
especially bumble-bees and dung-beetles. These are of considerable size for
mites; and there are other bright scarlet species which are sometimes found
on saw-flies, dragon-flies, etc. Many feed on decaying animal or vegetable
matter, such as the CHEESE-MITE and the SUGAR-MITE, the former being a very
familiar and interesting microscopic object; and others, again, are very
destructive to plants, like the small scarlet mite known in greenhouses as
the RED SPIDER.

Among the plant-feeding mites are the four-legged GALL-MITES, which produce
galls or other excrescences on the plants which they infest.

Mites are probably almost as varied in their forms and habits and as
interesting objects of study as insects or spiders; but the group is
somewhat neglected by naturalists, owing to the small size of most of the
species, and the consequent difficulty of collecting and preserving them.


CENTIPEDES AND MILLIPEDES.

These are creatures with long, worm-like bodies, composed of a number of
rings or segments, each provided with one or two pairs of legs. They have
one pair of antennæ, like insects, but they pass through no metamorphoses,
nor do they moult. Instead of this, they begin their existence, on quitting
the egg, without legs, or with only three pairs of legs, and continue to
add to the number of their segments and legs until they have attained their
full growth. They are called Centipedes, or Hundred-legs, and Millipedes,
or Thousand-legs; but in the majority of species the number of legs is
considerably below 100, though in some few it may exceed 300.

The CENTIPEDES have only one pair of legs attached to each segment of the
body, and are carnivorous, being armed with a pair of strong mandibles,
which are perforated poison-fangs. The British species are all small and
harmless, but the bite of the large tropical centipedes is more painful and
almost as dangerous as that of a snake. Centipedes are long, broad,
flattened creatures, with about twenty-one pairs of legs, and sometimes
measure more than a foot in length. A reddish centipede, belonging to an
allied family, is common in England under stones and in loose mould. It has
long antennæ and fifteen pairs of legs, and feeds chiefly on worms. It is
about an inch long.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

GIANT CENTIPEDE.

Most centipedes have considerably fewer than a hundred legs.]

The ELECTRIC CENTIPEDES are much longer and more slender than the others in
proportion to their length, with rather short antennæ, and short and very
numerous legs. They are of a white or yellow colour, and 2 or 3 inches
long. All are nocturnal in their habits, and feed on decaying animal or
vegetable matter, and are fond of ripe fruit. They emit a pale
phosphorescence, visible in the dark along the track over which they have
crawled.

MILLIPEDES are not venomous, and feed chiefly on soft vegetable matter.
Except the first three behind the head, which are provided with only one
pair each, every segment bears two pairs instead of one pair of legs. The
COMMON SNAKE-MILLIPEDE is about an inch and a half long, and is brown, with
yellow rings and ninety-nine pairs of short white legs. It is nearly as
destructive as the Wire-worms, which it resembles in its habits, and may
often be seen clinging to a partly eaten potato. Millipedes are able to
roll themselves up into a spiral. Many foreign kinds grow to a much larger
size, measuring nearly a foot in length. They are more frequently sent to
Europe from foreign countries than centipedes, probably because they are
sluggish, harmless creatures which do not bite.

The members of one family of millipedes, called PILL-MILLIPEDES, are so
similar to wood-lice in shape and appearance that they might easily be
mistaken for them, and they exhibit the same habit of rolling themselves up
into a ball. One species is not uncommon in England.

GIANT MILLIPEDE.

Shows the absence of jaws, which distinguishes these creatures from the
predatory centipedes.]

A curious genus, generally placed in a distinct class by itself, includes a
few species which may be called SLIMY MILLIPEDES. The species are found in
widely separated parts of the world, chiefly in the most southern regions,
such as South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, though one
or two are known from Ceylon and the West Indies. They resemble slimy
caterpillars, with conspicuous antennæ, and from thirteen to forty pairs of
legs. The body is not distinctly divided into segments, and it exudes a
very viscous slime, which acts like bird-lime in capturing the small
insects which form at least a part of the food of these creatures, but
which will not adhere to their own bodies. These creatures are found among
decaying vegetable matter.


INJURIOUS CREATURES.

We are sometimes inclined to complain of our English climate, but we have
cause to congratulate ourselves that it is far less prolific of noxious
creatures than many others. We have no venomous scorpions or centipedes,
and are not obliged to shake such intruders out of our boots before we can
venture to put them on. Since the country has been so well drained, we are
very little troubled with gnats, which breed in standing water, and are
equally troublesome in cold countries like Lapland, and warm countries like
South America. Nevertheless, several very troublesome creatures, not native
to this country, have taken up their abode with us permanently, and more
care should perhaps be exercised in preventing the possible introduction of
others. Among the most troublesome of our household insects are bugs,
cockroaches, and house-ants, all of which have been introduced from abroad.
Among field- and garden-pests, the American Blight (which destroys our
apple- and pear-trees) and the Hessian Fly are probably invaders from
abroad; but the latter does not seem to have committed great ravages in
this country. Among pests which have not succeeded in establishing
themselves here, but which we should be specially on our guard against, are
the White Ants, which are found as far north as Bordeaux, and are terribly
destructive to woodwork, wherever they are met with; the Gypsy-moth, very
destructive on the Continent and in North America, but extinct as a British
species, perhaps because there is something inimical to its constitution in
our climate; and the Colorado Potato-beetle, which is only kept out of
Europe by incessant vigilance. But apart from actually injurious insects,
it is remarkable how many species which are common everywhere on the
Continent are either absent from Britain, or are only met with in very
restricted localities. Let us hope that we may long enjoy our comparative
immunity from noxious insects in Britain.

CHAPTER II.

_INSECTS._


Insects are easily distinguished from the other jointed animals by many
salient characters. They have one pair of antennæ, two large compound eyes,
composed of a great number of facets, and sometimes one, two, or three
simple eyes placed on the crown or front of the head. In its adult
condition an insect is composed of three different parts, which can be most
readily noticed in a wasp. There is the head, with the antennæ and
mouth-parts; the thorax, to which one or two pairs of wings are attached
above, and three pairs of legs below; and the abdomen. Insects breathe
through openings, called "stigmata," in the sides of the thorax and
abdomen. They never possess more than six legs in the perfect state, the
abdominal legs present in caterpillars, etc., disappearing in the adult
condition. They generally pass through what is called a
"metamorphosis,"--four different stages of life, called respectively egg;
larva or caterpillar; pupa, nymph, or chrysalis; and imago, or perfect
insect.

Insects are divided into several large sections, of which the following
seven are the most important, and many entomologists prefer to include all
insects under them:--

Sheath-winged Insects, or Beetles; Straight-winged Insects, or Earwigs,
Cockroaches, Soothsayers, Stick-insects, Crickets, Grasshoppers, and
Locusts; Nerve-winged or Lace-winged Insects, or Dragon-flies and their
relatives; Stinging Four-winged Insects, or Ants, Bees and Wasps, and their
allies; Scale-winged Insects, or Butterflies and Moths; Half-winged
Insects, or Bugs and Frog-hoppers; Two-winged Insects, or Flies.

We proceed to notice these orders separately.


SHEATH-WINGED INSECTS, OR BEETLES.

BY THE REV. THEODORE WOOD, F.E.S.

Beetles are distinguished from most other insects by the fact that the
front wings are not employed in flight, but are modified into horny
sheaths, which cover and protect the lower pair while not in use. This
arrangement, however, is also found in the Earwigs as well as in the
so-called "Black-beetle" and its allies, and it is to be noted that the
wing-cases of beetles lie evenly side by side together when the wings are
folded, while the folding of the wings themselves is transverse as well as
longitudinal. The number of species is very great, upwards of 100,000
having already been described, of which about 3,400 have been taken in the
British Islands.

The order is again divided into several smaller groups, first among which
stand the predaceous beetles of the land. Of these the common English
TIGER-BEETLE is a familiar example. It is found on sandy and peaty heaths,
and may be known at once by its bright green wing-cases, marked with white
spots, and the metallic blue of the abdomen. The legs are coppery. It flies
with great swiftness in the hot sunshine, taking to wing as readily as a
blue-bottle fly, and feeds entirely upon other insects.

Another representative of the group is rich golden green in colour, with
coppery reflections. It is only an occasional visitor to Britain, but
abounds in France and Germany, where it feeds upon the caterpillars of the
famous Processionary Moth, and is largely instrumental in checking their
ravages in the great oak forests.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

TIGER-BEETLE.

The colouring of this insect is bright green with white markings and
coppery legs.]

Familiar to almost all is the PURPLE GROUND-BEETLE, so plentiful in
gardens, and easily recognisable by the violet margin to the black
wing-cases. It pours out an evil-smelling liquid from the end of the body
when handled.

The curious red-and-blue BOMBARDIER, which, when interfered with,
discharges a little puff of bluish-white smoke from the tip of the abdomen,
accompanied by a distinct report, is also a member of this group. It is
found under stones on river-banks, and also on the coast.

Next come the predaceous beetles of the water, of which we have a
well-known British representative in the GREAT BROWN WATER-BEETLE. This
insect, which is plentiful in weedy ponds, swims by means of its hind
limbs, which are modified into broad, flat oars, with a mechanical
arrangement for "feathering" as they are drawn back after making each
stroke. It flies by night, often travelling for a long distance from one
pond to another, and regains the water by suddenly folding its wings and
allowing itself to fall from a height. In the female insect the wing-cases
are grooved for about two-thirds of their length.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

GROUND-BEETLE.

The beetles of this group are generally of a black or bronzy colour, some
species being beautifully metallic.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

GREAT BROWN WATER-BEETLE (MALE).

A large olive-brown species, about an inch in length, and nearly half as
broad. The wing-cases of the female are grooved.]

This beetle must not be confounded with the still larger BLACK
WATER-BEETLE, which belongs to another group. This fine insect, which is
not predaceous in the perfect state, is locally plentiful in ditches, and
is in great request as an inmate of the freshwater aquarium. The hind limbs
are not modified for swimming purposes.

Next in order come the COCKTAILS, so called from their curious habit of
turning up the end of the body when alarmed. To this group belong most of
the tiny "flies" which cause such severe pain when they find their way into
the eyes. Some species, however, attain to a considerable size, the
well-known DEVIL'S COACH-HORSE being fully an inch in length. The great
majority are scavengers, being found in carrion, manure, and decaying
vegetable matter. A few, however, are lodgers in the nests of ants, by whom
they appear to be regarded as pets and treated with the utmost kindness.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

BLACK WATER-BEETLE.

A shining black species, longer, narrower, and more convex than the Great
Brown Water-beetle.]

The next group includes the curious insects popularly known as
BURYING-BEETLES, which inter the bodies of small animals in the ground,
scooping out the earth from underneath them by means of their broad and
powerful heads, and shovelling it back when the carcases have sunk to a
sufficient depth. The eggs are laid in the carrion thus buried. Most of
these beetles are distinguished by broad blotches or bars of orange on the
wing-cases, but one common British species is entirely black.

Allied to these, and very similar in habits, are the FLAT BURYING-BEETLES,
of which there are about a dozen British species. In the best known of
these the thorax is dull red in colour, and the black wing-cases are
curiously wrinkled. Another species is reddish yellow in colour, with two
round black spots on each wing-case. It is found on oak-trees, and feeds
upon caterpillars.

The LEAF-HORNED BEETLES are distinguished by the fact that the terminal
joints of the antennæ lie one upon another like the leaves of a book. In
many cases they can be expanded at will into a broad fan-like club. The
well-known STAG-BEETLE of Great Britain is a representative of this group.
It is a somewhat local species, being plentiful in some parts of the
country, and entirely unknown in others. The grub lives for several years
in the trunks of elm-trees, feeding upon the solid wood. When fully grown,
it buries itself in the earth, and constructs a large cocoon, in which it
passes the chrysalis stage of its existence. The perfect beetle emerges in
November, but remains within the cocoon until the following June. In the
female the jaws are very much smaller than in the male, but are
nevertheless more formidable as weapons. The insect may often be seen
flying on warm summer evenings.

[Illustration: _Photos by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

TWO BURYING-BEETLES.

These insects are about an inch in length; many are black, but others have
orange-red bands on the wing-cases.]

A still larger insect belonging to the same group is the HERCULES BEETLE,
found in the West Indies and tropical America, a male of average size being
nearly 5 inches in length. In this beetle the thorax is prolonged into a
horn, which is curved downwards, while the head is produced into a similar
horn curved upwards, so that the two look like a pair of enormous jaws. It
has been stated that these horns, both of which are furnished with
tooth-like projections, are employed in sawing off the smaller branches of
trees, the beetle grasping a bough firmly, and flying round and round in a
circle, till the wood is completely cut through. This assertion, however,
is totally unworthy of credit. An example of the beetle--evidently
imported--was recently found crawling on a hedge near Biggleswade.

One of the largest of all known beetles is DRURY'S GOLIATH BEETLE, a native
of the Gaboon, whose body is almost as big as the closed fist of a man. It
appears to feed, while a grub, on the wood of decaying trees, and undergoes
its transformation to the chrysalis state in an earthen cocoon, the
peculiarity of which is that a thick belt, or ridge, runs round the middle.
How this belt is formed is a mystery, as it lies upon the outside, while
the grub necessarily constructs the cocoon from the inside. Several living
examples of this beetle were exhibited in the summer of 1898 in the
Insect-house of the Zoological Gardens in the Regent's Park, where they
remained for five or six weeks, feeding on the flesh of melons. A
photograph of this beetle will be found in the Coloured Plate.

The common COCKCHAFER belongs to another division of the same group. This
insect is extremely injurious, as the grub lives for three years or more
underground, feeding on the roots of various cultivated plants. The perfect
beetle appears in May and June, and is only too plentiful almost
everywhere. A month or so later its place is taken by the SUMMER CHAFER, or
JUNE BUG, which may often be seen flying in hundreds round the tops of low
trees soon after sunset, while the smaller COCH-Y-BONDDHU--the
"Cockerbundy" of the angler--often appears about the same time in hundreds
of thousands. The beautiful ROSE-BEETLE, too, with its bright golden-green
wing-cases marked with wavy whitish lines, may often be seen sunning itself
in roses or on the blossoms of pinks.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

MALE STAG-BEETLE.

The males are often 2 inches long; the females have comparatively small
jaws.]


[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

SKIPJACK BEETLE.

The larvæ of this family are known as Wire-worms.]


[Illustration: _Photo by L. H. Joutel_]     [_New York._

HERCULES BEETLE FLYING.

The most remarkable feature about this insect is its huge horn-like
projection from the thorax, which is nearly as long as the rest of its
body.]

The famous EGYPTIAN SCARABÆUS is also a member of this group. It is
remarkable not only for the sacred character attributed to it by the
ancient Egyptians, but also for its curious habit of rolling along balls of
dung until it can find a soft spot in which to bury them. When the egg
hatches, the grub feeds upon the dung, the quantity provided being exactly
sufficient for its requirements. The common DOR BEETLE of Great Britain is
allied to this insect; it tunnels down to a depth of 14 or 15 inches
beneath a patch of excrement, and lays its egg at the bottom of the burrow.

The SKIPJACK BEETLES, parents of the well-known Wire- worms, which cause so
much mischief by feeding upon the roots of cultivated crops, represent
another group. These beetles owe their popular title to their singular
method of regaining their feet when they happen to roll over upon their
backs. Their bodies being very smooth and polished, and their legs very
short, they cannot recover their footing in the ordinary manner. On the
lower part of the body, however, is a highly elastic spine, known as the
"mucro," which lies in a sheath. When the beetle falls over, it arches its
body into the form of a bow, resting only upon the head and the extreme tip
of the abdomen, removes the spine from its sheath, and then drives it
sharply back again. The result is that the central part of the body strikes
the ground with such force that the insect springs into the air to a height
of 2 or 3 inches. Then, turning half over as it falls, it alights on its
feet.

[Illustration: _Photo by B. H. Bentley_]     [_Sheffield._

COCKCHAFER ON DAISY.

A very destructive insect which feeds on the leaves of trees. The larva
devours the roots of plants, and is often so plentiful as to cause very
serious mischief.]

The FIRE-FLY of the tropics belongs to the same group. The luminosity of
this insect proceeds from two different parts of the body, a brilliant
yellowish-green light shining out through two transparent window-like spots
on the thorax, while an orange glow is visible on the lower surface of the
abdomen. The exact cause of the light is unknown, as is also the manner of
its control by the insect.

The same may be said of the common English GLOWWORM, in which the light
proceeds from the lower surface of the hind part of the body. The male of
this insect is winged; the female is grub-like in appearance and wingless.
The grub itself, which may be found in autumn, is also luminous, and feeds
upon snails.

Another group includes a very large number of beetles of very varying
character and appearance. Among these are the OIL-BEETLES, so called from
their habit of exuding small drops of an oily liquid from the joints of
their limbs when handled. The eggs are laid in batches of several thousand
in holes in the ground, and the little long-legged grubs, on emerging,
clamber up the stems of flowers, and hide themselves among the petals to
await the coming of a bee. When one of the latter appears, two or three of
the grubs cling to its hairy body, and are carried back to the nest, in
which they live as parasites. One of these beetles may be seen commonly
upon grassy banks in early spring.

Allied to these insects is the BLISTER-BEETLE, or SPANISH FLY, so well
known from its use in medicine. It is a very handsome species, of a bright
golden-green colour, occasionally found in Great Britain on the foliage of
ash-trees. In many parts of Southern Europe it is extremely abundant.

The beetles belonging to the large and important group of WEEVILS are
characterised, as a rule, by the fact that the head is prolonged into a
more or less long and slender snout, or "rostrum," at the end of which the
jaws are situated. The number of species already known is above 20,000.

[Illustration: _Photo by L. H. Joutel_]     [_New York._

HARLEQUIN BEETLE.

Notice the enormous length of the front legs.]

One of the largest and most famous of these insects is the DIAMOND-BEETLE
of Brazil, the scales from whose wing-cases are so frequently mounted as
microscopic objects. When viewed through a good instrument under a powerful
light, the beauty of these scales is simply indescribable. All that one can
say of them is that they seem to be composed of diamonds, rubies, topazes,
and emeralds massed together in rich profusion, while diamonds are
transformed into rubies, rubies into topazes, and topazes into emeralds at
every change of light.

The OSIER-WEEVIL, a black-and-white species about three-eighths of an inch
long, is found on osiers in Great Britain, the grub boring galleries in the
stems, and often causing considerable damage. The well-known CORN-WEEVIL is
still more destructive in granaries, the walls of which are often
completely blackened by its crawling multitudes. The grub lives inside the
grain, eating out the whole of the interior, and a single pair of the
weevils are said to be capable of producing a family of more than 6,000
individuals in the course of a single season. The RICE-WEEVIL is equally
destructive to rice, and may be recognised by the two red spots on each
wing-case.

The famous "GRU-GRU" of the West Indies, which is regarded as so great a
dainty both by the negroes and by many of the white colonists, is the grub
of the PALM-WEEVIL. It lives in the stems of palm-trees, and also in those
of sugar-canes, causing a great deal of mischief by its burrowings. When
fully fed, it constructs a cocoon by tearing off strips of bark and weaving
them neatly together. The SUGAR-WEEVIL is still more troublesome, feeding
upon the juice of the sugar-cane, and affecting the entire plant in such a
manner that sugar can no longer be manufactured from it.

"Bad" nuts are also due to one of these insects, the common NUT-WEEVIL.
which introduces its egg into the kernel during the earlier stages of its
development. When the grub hatches, it proceeds to devour the kernel,
leaving a quantity of bad-flavoured "frass" behind it, while the shell is
left untouched until the perfect insect emerges. An allied species attacks
acorns in a similar manner.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. Edwards_]     [_Colesborne._

JUMPING-BEETLE. ALLIED TO THE TURNIP-FLEA.

It is about one-tenth of an inch in length.]

Among the finest and largest of all beetles are many of those belonging to
the great Long-horn group, of which the common BRITISH MUSK-BEETLE is a
familiar example. This insect owes both its popular and scientific titles
to its powerful odour, which perhaps resembles that of sweetbriar rather
than musk, and can often be detected at a distance of twenty or thirty
yards. The beetle, which is rich metallic green in colour, with long,
slender antennæ, may be found in July sunning itself on the trunks or
foliage of willow-trees. It varies considerably in size.

Still more plentiful is the WASP-BEETLE, with its black wing-cases banded
with bright yellow. While flying, it may easily be mistaken for the insect
whose name it bears. The grub lives in old posts, rails, hop-poles, etc.,
feeding upon the solid wood.

The TIMBERMAN is remarkable for the extreme length of the antennæ, which,
in the male insect, are three or four times as long as the body, and trail
out far behind it during flight. It is found, not uncommonly, in fir woods
in Scotland.

The beautiful HARLEQUIN BEETLE of tropical America is one of the largest
members of the group, and is remarkable for the great length of the front
legs as well as for the singular colouring of the wing-cases. It lives
almost entirely in the trees, swinging itself from branch to branch
somewhat after the manner of a spider-monkey. When it ventures into the
air, it is greatly incommoded by the size of its limbs and the length of
its antennæ, and seems to have but little power of directing its course.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. Edwards, Colesborne._

REED-BEETLE.

Among the group to which this insect belongs are many of the most
brilliantly coloured British beetles.]

Another great group of beetles is that of the PLANT-EATERS, many of which
are exceedingly beautiful. The REED-BEETLES of Britain, for example, are
resplendent in crimson and green and purple and blue, while the metallic
radiance of others has gained for them the title of GOLDEN APPLES.

The notorious COLORADO BEETLE is a member of this group. It may be
recognised at once by the five black streaks running down each of the
yellow wing-cases. On the havoc which it causes among potato-plants in
North America it is unnecessary to dilate. On a smaller scale, the
TURNIP-FLEA is very mischievous in Britain, perforating the leaves of
turnip-plants, or--worse still--eating off the seed-leaves as soon as they
appear above the surface of the ground. Of only too many of these exquisite
beetles, in fact, it must be said that their beauty is only equalled by
their destructiveness.

The LADYBIRDS include a very large number of species. Some of these, such
as the common TWO-SPOT LADYBIRD, are exceedingly variable, a long series
being easily obtained in which no two specimens resemble one another. Both
as grubs and as perfect insects they feed upon the "Green Fly" of the
farmer, combining with the grubs of the Lace-wing and Hoverer Flies to keep
its numbers within due limits.

Almost equally common is the SEVEN-SPOT LADYBIRD, a considerably larger
insect, with seven round black spots on its scarlet wing-cases, which may
be seen on almost any grassy bank in spring. Both this and the preceding
species sometimes visit the Kentish coast in vast swarms, the beach being
reddened by their bodies for miles. The last immigration of this
description took place in 1886, in the summer of which year the hops in
East Kent were almost destroyed by blight, and the ladybirds made their way
at once to the hop-fields and cleared them of the pest in a wonderfully
short space of time. A much smaller species, known as the TWENTY-TWO SPOT,
is yellow in colour and has eleven black spots on each wing-case. It is
generally found crawling about on nettle-leaves in the early part of the
summer.

Allied to the Ladybirds are the very curious TORTOISE-BEETLES. In these
insects the wing-cases project to a considerable distance beyond the sides
of the body, and the legs are so short that only the feet can be seen from
above, so that the appearance is very much like that of a tortoise with the
limbs partly withdrawn into the shell. Many different species are known, in
some of which the wing-cases are streaked with brilliant metallic silver,
which, however, fades away very shortly after death. The commonest of the
British tortoise-beetles is found on thistles.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

MUSK-BEETLE.

The odour of this beetle may often be detected at a distance of twenty or
thirty yards.]

Another very large group of beetles is represented by the CELLAR-BEETLE,
which is generally very common in old houses. This insect must not be
confused with the so-called "Black-beetle," from which it may easily be
distinguished by its deep black colour, its very much shorter feelers, and
the curious point into which the end of its body is produced. It hides away
in dark corners by day, and crawls slowly about by night. Related to it is
the MEAL-WORM, so much in request for the food of cage-birds, which is
usually very plentiful in granaries.

Very different, in appearance, yet belonging to the same group, is the
handsome CARDINAL BEETLE, a bright scarlet insect which is not uncommon in
summer. It may sometimes be found lurking behind pieces of loose bark, and
is also fond of resting upon the flowers of umbelliferous plants in the hot
sunshine. A second species, which is not nearly so plentiful, may be
distinguished by the fact that the head is entirely black.

Still more curious is the RHIPIPHORUS BEETLE, which is parasitic within the
nests of wasps. Where the egg is laid, or how the grub first finds its way
into the nest, no one has yet succeeded in discovering; but having made its
entry, the insect proceeds to burrow into the body of a wasp-grub, and
lives within it for several days, feeding upon its flesh meanwhile. After
increasing considerably in size, it creeps out of the carcase of its victim
and changes its skin, after which it resumes its interrupted meal, and
continues to feed until the last vestige of the wasp-grub has been
devoured. It then changes to a chrysalis in the cell, and the perfect
insect appears a few days later. Oddly enough, the wasps appear to take no
notice of its presence, and never attempt to molest it. The two sexes of
this beetle are quite unlike one another, the male having the wing-cases
yellow and the feelers heavily plumed, while the female is black, with the
feelers only slightly toothed.

Most singular of all the insects belonging to this order, however, is the
strange little STALK-EYED BEETLE, which spends the greater part of its life
half buried in the body of a bee. In this insect the feelers are branched,
somewhat like the antennules, or lesser feelers, of a lobster, and the
eyes, which are comparatively few in number, are set at the ends of short
foot-stalks. The male has very narrow wing-cases, but extremely large
wings, which have a milky appearance during flight that can hardly be
mistaken. The female has no wings at all, and in general aspect is nothing
more than a grub. In early spring a great number of solitary bees are
infested by this extraordinary parasite, which burrows into their bodies
under cover of the projecting edges of the segments, and there remains
feeding upon their internal juices for several weeks, with only just the
tip of its tail protruding. When fully fed, it emerges from the body of its
involuntary host, leaving a large round hole behind it, which frequently
closes up and heals. In any case, strange to say, the ravages of the
parasite appear to have but little effect upon the health of the bee.




STRAIGHT-WINGED INSECTS, OR EARWIGS, COCKROACHES, SOOTHSAYERS,
STICK-INSECTS, CRICKETS, GRASSHOPPERS, AND LOCUSTS.

BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.


The insects of this order are less numerous in species than those of any
other but the next, and are easily recognised. The fore wings are usually
of a leathery consistency, and the hind wings are folded beneath them like
a fan in the more typical families, though in the Earwigs and Cockroaches a
somewhat different arrangement prevails. In the Earwigs, indeed, the wings
are doubled back at the ends, and in the Cockroaches the wing-cases, or
"tegmina," as they are technically called, overlap. As a rule these insects
feed entirely on vegetable substances. The "Soothsayers" form an exception,
being carnivorous, though they are not parasitic, like the Ichneumon-flies,
but feed on fresh food; and several species of Earwigs, Cockroaches, and
Crickets, especially those which are semi-domesticated, are omnivorous, and
will eat animal as well as vegetable food. These insects have an imperfect
metamorphosis--that is, there is no inactive pupa-state; but, the young, on
emerging from the egg, already possess a recognisable resemblance to their
full-grown parents, and their metamorphosis consists of a series of moults,
before the last of which rudimentary wings appear in those species which
ultimately acquire these appendages. A considerable number of species never
have wings, a circumstance which frequently renders it difficult to
determine whether a specimen is fully developed. The antennæ are usually
long, and the joints distinctly separated, but are very rarely feathered.
At the other end of the body we often find two long jointed organs, called
"cerci." The jaws are always furnished with strong mandibles. Many
Grasshoppers and Locusts have a curious arrangement on the shank of the
front leg, consisting either of a round or an oval cavity on each side,
closed by a membrane, or of two long parallel slits in front. These are
considered to be organs of hearing. The largest known insects belong to
this order; the proportion of large or moderate-sized species is
considerable; and the smallest are probably considerably larger than the
smallest members of any other group. They are not numerous in temperate
climates; there are only about fifty British species, and most of the
larger of these are either naturalised species, or merely casual visitors
from abroad.

EARWIG. The forceps-like appendage at the end of this insect's body is said
to be used for folding and unfolding the wings.]

AMERICAN COCKROACH.

Common in many warehouses in England, and now found in most parts of the
world.]

The EARWIGS form the first family. Some are wingless, but most have very
short wing-cases, under which very large wings, forming the most beautiful
feature of these otherwise unattractive insects, are doubled and folded
into a very small compass. Some of the smaller species fly readily; but
others, such as the COMMON EARWIG, though furnished with ample wings, are
rarely seen to use them. The most conspicuous organ of the earwigs is the
curious forceps at the extremity of the body, the use of which does not
seem to be well made out, though it has been suggested that it is used for
folding and unfolding the wings. The forceps differs very much in size and
shape in different species; it is always larger in the male than in the
female, and often differently shaped. In the common earwig the male forceps
is flattened and contiguous at the base, and rounded and incurved at the
extremity. There are two varieties, in one of which the forceps is twice as
long as in the other; but intermediate gradations do not seem to be met
with. In the female the forceps is narrow, nearly straight, and
approximating. The earwig is a nocturnal insect, and hides itself during
the day in large-headed flowers, like dahlias, to which it is very
destructive, or in any convenient dark and narrow crevice, especially among
decaying vegetable matter. It derives its name from its occasionally
entering the human ear, but it may be easily driven out by dropping in a
little olive oil. In most books it is denied that earwigs enter the ear at
all, but it is, nevertheless, an undoubted fact; and the fanciful
derivation that has been suggested of _earwing_ in the place of _earwig_
cannot be entertained respecting an insect which seldom shows its wings at
all. It should be noted that the female earwig is said to tend her young
very much as a hen tends her chickens--an uncommon habit in insects.

STICK-INSECT.

The largest insect known is a species of stick-insect; it is a native of
Borneo, and measures 13 inches.]

WALKING LEAF-INSECTS.

Natives of the East Indies, and remarkable for their resemblance to green
leaves.]

The COMMON COCKROACH is too well known to need description. The individuals
with half-developed wings are the perfect females; but there are other
species in which the wings are fully developed in both sexes, others in
which the male is winged and the female wingless, and others again in which
both sexes are wingless. In warm countries and on ship-board cockroaches
are far more troublesome than in cold climes; and the large brown ones,
with a mark on the back of the thorax resembling a crown, and very broad
wing-cases and wings, are called DRUMMERS in the West Indies, from the loud
noise they keep up during the night.

Lady Burton has given an amusing account of her introduction to cockroaches
abroad: "After two days we were given a very pleasant suite of
rooms--bedroom, dining- and drawing-room--with wide windows overlooking the
Tagus and a great part of Lisbon. These quarters were, however, not without
drawbacks, for here occurred an incident which gave me a foretaste of the
sort of thing I was to expect in Brazil. Our bedroom was a large
whitewashed place; there were three holes in the wall, one at the bedside
bristling with horns, and these were cockroaches some three inches long.
The drawing-room was gorgeous with yellow satin, and the magnificent yellow
curtains were sprinkled with these crawling things. The consequence was
that I used to stand on a chair and scream. This annoyed Richard very much.
'A nice sort of traveller and companion _you_ are going to make,' he said;
'I suppose you think you look very pretty and interesting standing on that
chair and howling at those innocent creatures.' This hurt me so much that,
without descending from the chair, I stopped screaming, and made a
meditation like St. Simon Stylites on his pillar; and it was, 'That if I
was going to live in a country always in contact with these and worse
things, though I had a perfect horror of anything black and crawling, it
would never do to go on like that.' So I got down, fetched a basin of water
and a slipper, and in two hours by the watch I had knocked ninety-seven of
them into it. It cured me. From that day I had no more fear of vermin and
reptiles, which is just as well in a country where Nature is
over-luxuriant. A little while after we changed our rooms we were succeeded
by Lord and Lady Lytton, and, to my infinite delight, I heard the same
screams coming from the same room a little while after. 'There,' I said in
triumph, 'you see I am not the _only_ woman who does not like
cockroaches.'"

HOUSE-CRICKET.

Very similar in its habits to the cockroach.]

The dimensions of the insects are not so much exaggerated; for I believe
this story refers to the large reddish American cockroach, which is common
in many English cities, although only in warehouses. It does not usually
much exceed an inch in length; but the antennæ are very long, and the
wing-cases expand nearly 3 inches. (See photograph on page 689.)

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

MOLE-CRICKET.

A brown insect about 2 inches long. The very broad and flat front legs are
used for burrowing.]

The SOOTHSAYERS, or PRAYING-INSECTS, are not British, though one or two
species are found in the south of Europe. They have long fore legs, the
shanks of which are set with a double row of long, curving, sabre-like
spines, and when at rest they hold them up as if in the attitude of prayer;
but they are really on the look-out for prey, and the long spines are
admirably adapted for wounding or grasping the insects which form their
food. They also fight fiercely among themselves, and it is no uncommon
occurrence for a female to tear to pieces and devour her mate, either
during or after their courtship. The soothsayers are often of a green
colour, so as to match the grass and leaves among which they live, and thus
conceal them from their prey.

The STICK-INSECTS. or SPECTRE-INSECTS, have some resemblance to the
Soothsayers, but are exclusively vegetable-feeders, and have long,
sprawling legs, or shorter ones, sometimes more or less lobate; but they
never possess prehensile fore legs for seizing prey. The wing-cases are
generally quite small; but some species have beautiful large green or pink
wings, folded fan-wise, and covered by the stout front border of the wing.
Many species are wingless, and of a grey or brown colour, which renders
them scarcely distinguishable from dry bits of stick; and among these is
the largest living insect known, a grey stick-like species from Borneo,
measuring nearly 13 inches from head to tail. Other species have curious
excrescences on the legs and body, which make them look like bits of wood
overgrown with moss or lichen; while others possess large flat lobes
growing from the legs and body, which cause them to be almost
indistinguishable from green leaves; and, indeed, these insects are
frequently called "Walking Leaves."

LONG-HORNED GRASSHOPPER.

This insect belongs to the same family as the well-known British species.
The specimen from which this photograph was taken had unfortunately (as is
often the case) broken antennæ; they should be twice as long as the wings.]

With the CRICKETS we commence the last three families of the group, which
are distinguished from the others by their power of leaping. The hind legs
are very long, with very thick thighs, and generally a double row of strong
teeth or spines on the shanks. The feet are generally three-jointed, and
there is usually a long ovipositor in the females. There are very few true
crickets in England, but three of these are very conspicuous species. The
first is the MOLE-CRICKET, a large light brown insect nearly 2 inches long,
with broad, short front legs rather like those of a mole, which it uses in
a similar way. Though common and destructive in fields and gardens, it is
not often seen: but if water be thrown on the ground overnight, and a board
laid over it, one or two mole-crickets are likely to be found underneath in
the morning. The HOUSE-CRICKET resembles this insect in colour, but is not
much more than half an inch long, and there is nothing remarkable in the
structure of its legs. It is almost the only noisy insect found in English
houses, and is very similar to the common cockroach in its habits, although
free from the disagreeable smell which adds to the disgust the latter
insect often inspires. The third species, the FIELD-CRICKET, is a smooth
black insect, larger and stouter than the house-cricket. It constructs
burrows in grassy places, but is not now a very common species in England.
In the last two species, and many others, there is a bare space on one of
the wing-cases of the male, crossed by ribs in a manner varying according
to the species, which helps to produce the loud chirping for which these
insects are remarkable.

CAPE GRASSHOPPER (FEMALE).

This insect, which is remarkable for the inflated bladder-like appearance
of the male, is an object of superstition among the Boers. Colour, bright
apple-green with white stripes.]

The LONG-HORNED GRASSHOPPERS, which form the next family, are distinguished
by having four joints to their feet, a long ovipositor in the female, and
very long, slender antennæ. The commonest species inhabiting England, and
one of the largest grasshoppers, is the GREAT GREEN GRASSHOPPER, which is
found leaping about among long grass and low bushes, especially in the
south of England. It is about 2 inches in length. Among the foreign species
of this rather extensive family, we may mention some green or reddish South
American species, with a large round spot on the hind wings, not unlike
those seen in the peacock-butterfly.

WART-EATING GRASSHOPPER (TWO VIEWS).

Used by Swedish peasants to bite off their warts.]

The last family includes the SHORT-HORNED GRASSHOPPERS, or TRUE LOCUSTS, so
very destructive in many countries, though the real MIGRATORY LOCUSTS are
only casual visitors to England, the native British species being all small
insects, found among grass, and doing but little damage. The commonest of
the Migratory Locusts visiting Britain is the RED-LEGGED LOCUST, which
expands from 2 to 4 inches, and has grey wing-cases varied with brown, pale
green hind wings, and red hind shanks, with white black-tipped spines.
Another species, the EGYPTIAN LOCUST, more rarely met with, has brown fore
wings, and grey hind wings, crossed by a broad blackish band. Two
photographs are given on page 693 of a specimen brought to England among
vegetables in the spring of 1901. Many foreign locusts, large and small,
have beautiful red or blue hind wings, and some of these are common on the
Continent, though not in England; those found in Europe are comparatively
small, measuring only 1 or 2 inches across the wing-cases; but some of the
great South American locusts measure as much as 7 or 8 inches in expanse.
However, some of the smaller species, such as the CYPRIAN LOCUST and the
ROCKY MOUNTAIN LOCUST, which measure less than 2 inches across the
wing-cases, are much more destructive than the large species.

A real invasion of locusts is a terrible calamity, for the insects fly like
birds, but in vast flocks, and devour every scrap of vegetation where they
settle. Sometimes a flight, two or three miles broad, continues to fly
steadily over the same spot for hours together. Sometimes flocks perish at
sea, and are cast up on the beach in heaps like sand-hills, extending for a
distance of forty or fifty miles. Nor are the young locusts less
destructive before they acquire wings; for they march across a district in
such numbers as to extinguish fires, fill up trenches, and overcome all
similar obstacles placed in their way by sheer force of numbers; and it is
well said of a visitation of locusts, "The land is as the Garden of Eden
before them, and behind is a desolate wilderness."




NERVE-WINGED OR LACE-WINGED INSECTS, OR DRAGON-FLIES AND THEIR RELATIVES.

BY THE REV. THEODORE WOOD, F.E.S.


The Nerve-winged Insects owe their title to the peculiar character of their
wings, the horny veins which form the framework of those organs being
multiplied and sub-divided to such an extent that they assume the
appearance of exceedingly delicate network.

These insects fall naturally into two great groups, in one of which the
chrysalis, or pupa, is active, and continues to take food like the grub,
while in the other it is passive and helpless, like that of a butterfly or
a moth.

Prominent among the members of the first division are the Dragon-flies,
which owe their title partly to their extreme voracity, and partly to the
fact that they feed entirely upon living insects, which they pursue through
the air. They are exceedingly swift of wing, and may be seen hawking over
ponds and streams on any fine day throughout the summer and early autumn.

The earlier part of their lives is spent in the water, in which the eggs
are laid by the parent insect. The grubs are usually of a dull grey or
brownish-green colour, and are remarkable for a curious organ known as the
"mask," which partly covers the lower surface of the head. This apparatus
consists of two joints, which fold upon one another, but can be extended at
will, the one farthest from the head terminating in a pair of large and
powerful jaws. When the grub perceives an insect-victim, it swims
cautiously beneath, and seizes it by means of these jaws. The "mask" is
then folded, and the prisoner drawn down within reach of the mandibles, by
means of which it is speedily devoured.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

DRAGON-FLY.

These insects are often known as "Horse-stingers," although they do not
sting horses; in fact, they are perfectly harmless, except to insects
smaller and weaker than themselves.]

The method of swimming practised by the dragon-fly grub is also very
curious. Through the centre of the body runs a longitudinal tube,
terminating in a circular orifice, closed by means of five tightly fitting
valves. These valves, which together form a sharp spike when closed, can be
separated at will. When the insect wishes to swim, it fills the tube with
water, and then squirts the contents forcibly out, the result being that it
is driven swiftly forwards by the reaction.

The pupa of the dragon-fly is very much like the grub, with the exception
that the rudiments of the future wings may be seen on the back.

About forty species of these insects are found in the British Islands, of
which the GREAT DRAGON-FLY is a well-known example. The body is 3 inches in
length, while the extended wings measure about 4 inches from tip to tip. In
colour it is light rusty brown, with a few pale markings. The
"HORSE-STINGER"--which is perfectly harmless, notwithstanding its popular
title--is also common, and may be recognised at once by its flat dull
yellow body, which becomes blue in the fully developed male. In the
graceful and beautiful DEMOISELLE the male is deep blue, with black patches
on the wings, while the female is entirely green.

Allied to these insects is the COMMON MAY-FLY, popularly supposed to live
for one day only. As a matter of fact, however, it spends a couple of years
in the grub and pupa states, inhabiting burrows in the banks of ponds and
streams. These burrows are curved, and have two entrances, one above the
other, so that the insect can pass in and out with perfect ease.

The May-fly is also remarkable for the fact that the perfect insect changes
its skin shortly after reaching maturity. Before this change takes place
the female insect is the "Green Drake" of the angler; afterwards, the "Grey
Drake."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

QUEEN TERMITE.

Her huge white body is full of eggs, of which she lays thousands every
day.]

To this group belong also the TERMITES, or "White Ants," so exceedingly
numerous in almost all the warmer parts of the world. These are social
insects, living together in vast colonies, and making most wonderful nests,
which consist of a vast and complicated series of chambers and passages,
sheltered beneath a turreted dome of clay. In the centre is the "royal
cell," inhabited by the "king" and "queen," as the perfect male and female
are called. These are winged when first they leave the pupal shell. But
after taking a single flight, they snap off their wings at the base, just
as ants do; while for the rest of their lives they are absolute prisoners
in the cell built around them by the workers.

Shortly after this strange incarceration takes place, the body of the queen
swells to a huge size, so that, to quote Professor Drummond, she becomes "a
large, loathsome, cylindrical package, 2 or 3 inches long, in shape like a
sausage, and as white as a bolster." She now begins to deposit eggs at the
rate of several thousands in a day, which are at once carried off by the
workers, to whom is entrusted the entire care of the helpless young. These
workers, which are exceedingly numerous, also enlarge the nest from time to
time, and construct tunnels of clay up the trunks and along the branches of
trees, through which they may convey to the nurseries in security the gums
and decaying wood for the nutriment of the young.

A fourth form of insect is also found in the termites' nest, known as the
"Soldier." The head is much larger and the jaws are much longer and
stronger than those of the worker, and the sole function appears to be to
defend the nest when attacked. Both soldier and worker, apparently, proceed
from the same eggs which produce the king and queen, the difference in
development being probably due--as in the hive-bee--to the character of the
food with which the young are supplied.

TERMITES AT WORK.

This shows one of the most destructive of wood-eating insects, nearly of
the natural size.]

In a state of nature termites are undoubtedly beneficial. They are
scavengers, in fact, whose duty it is to remove the dead and decaying wood
which would otherwise encumber the ground for many years. But in civilised
districts they are extremely mischievous, books, furniture, and all the
woodwork of houses being often completely destroyed by them before their
presence is even suspected.

The second division of the order also forms two well-marked groups--namely,
the Flat-winged Insects, in which the wings are fully spread, horizontally
or obliquely, even in repose, and the Hairy-winged Insects, in which those
organs can be folded longitudinally, like the joints of a fan.

Of the former group, the ANT-LION of Southern Europe is a familiar example.
The perfect insect is seldom seen, owing to its nocturnal habits. In
appearance it is not unlike a small and delicately built dragon-fly, with a
yellowish head, a black body, and transparent wings marbled with brownish
spots. The larva, however, is terrestrial, and lives in a funnel-shaped
pitfall which it scoops out in the sand, always working backwards in a
spiral direction, and jerking out the sand with its broad head in an almost
continuous shower. Having completed the excavation, it buries itself at the
bottom with merely the tips of its jaws appearing above the surface, and
there waits for ants or other small creatures to fall down the sloping
sides, accelerating their descent, if need be, by flinging sand upon them.
The size of the pit varies with that of the insect, the fully grown grub
digging down to the depth of about 2 inches, while the cavity is about 3
inches in diameter.

The mouth of the ant-lion grub is very curiously constructed, the jaws
lying in a groove on the inner margin of the mandibles, or jaws proper; so
that while an insect is held prisoner by the latter, the former can be
employed in sucking its juices. When the body of the victim has been
completely drained, the empty skin is thrown out of the pit by a jerk of
the head.

The chrysalis, too, is remarkable for possessing jaws, by means of which it
cuts its way out of the cocoon which it made, when a larva, by spinning
grains of sand together with silken threads.

In some South European and African insects allied to the ant-lions the hind
wings are modified into extremely long and slender shafts, slightly
expanded at the extremities. In an Indian species belonging to a related
genus these wings are scarcely more than threads, and bear a superficial
resemblance to the attenuated limbs of certain gnats. One group, of which a
Japanese species is a well-known representative, is characterised by the
long, slender, and clubbed antennæ.

TERMITES' NEST.

Showing one year's reconstruction to nest, of which the photographer made a
section.]

The MANTIS-FLIES are remarkable for the structure of the fore limbs, which
are almost exactly similar in character to those of the praying-mantis. The
upper segment of the leg is so lengthened as to look like an additional
joint; the lower surface of the thigh is armed with a number of long, sharp
spines; and the tibia, or lower part of the leg, folds closely down upon
it, after the manner of the blade of a clasp-knife. These limbs are used
for seizing, an insect which is once grasped being effectually prevented by
the spines from breaking away.

The larvæ of these insects are parasitic in the nests of tree-wasps and
spiders, and have the peculiarity of practically losing their limbs as they
approach maturity; so that while at first they are free and active, they
afterwards become almost as helpless as those of many beetles. One species
is found in Southern Europe, the remainder being widely distributed over
the hotter regions of the globe.

Allied to the Mantis-flies are the curious SNAKE-FLIES, or CAMEL-FLIES. In
these insects the head is very large, and is attached to the thorax, or
central division of the body, by a long and distinct neck, which allows it
great freedom of motion. The neck is usually raised and the head bent down,
giving to the insect a remarkably snake-like appearance.

These flies are predaceous in their habits, and the four British species
may be found on the banks of ponds and small streams, where they can obtain
insect-victims in plenty. The larvæ live beneath the bark of trees, and
wriggle about in a singularly serpentine fashion.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

SCORPION-FLY.

Remarkable for the curious structure of the end of the body.]

Equally curious in a different way are the SCORPION-FLIES, in which the
body is prolonged into a slender three-jointed process, the extremity of
which, in the male, is furnished with a pair of curved forceps. In spite of
their somewhat formidable appearance these insects are perfectly harmless.
They are very plentiful almost everywhere, and may be found in numbers on
any sunny summer morning resting on the herbage on hedge-banks, or running
actively about on the leaves of low bushes. Like the Snake-flies, they are
predaceous, feeding entirely upon other insects, and often attacking those
which are bigger and apparently stronger than themselves. The eggs are laid
underground, and the grubs, which are entirely subterranean in their
habits, feed upon decomposing vegetable matter. When fully fed, they burrow
still deeper into the ground, and there change into pupæ, from which the
perfect insects emerge about a fortnight later. In the common English
species the body is shining black, and the legs are yellow, while the
transparent wings are marked with brown spots, which generally form three
broken transverse bands. The insect is about half an inch in length.

Certain allied insects have very slender bodies and long legs, and might
easily be mistaken for "daddy-long-legs" by any one who failed to notice
the presence of two pairs of wings. A species found in Southern Europe is
reddish yellow in colour, with a brown thorax and yellowish wings. It has a
curious habit of suspending itself from a twig by its fore legs, and
seizing any flying insect which may come within reach with the middle and
hinder pairs.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

ADULT FORM OF ANT-LION.

The grub of this insect lives in small pits in sandy places, and feeds upon
the ants, etc., which roll down the sloping sides.]

Allied to the foregoing is the extraordinary little snow-insect, which
makes its appearance in mid-winter, and may even be found crawling on the
surface of snow. In general appearance it is not unlike a larval
grasshopper, with very long, slender legs, and antennæ of about the same
length as the body. There is also a well-developed beak. The wings are
quite rudimentary in the female, while even in the male they are so short
as to be perfectly useless for flight. The insect is remarkably active,
nevertheless, and possesses the power of leaping, although the hinder
thighs are not developed in any great degree. In colour it is metallic
green, with the beak, antennæ, legs, wings, and ovipositor rusty red. It is
not uncommon in the north of England and Scotland.

Far more generally distributed is the LACEWING-FLY, or GOLDEN-EYE, which
may be seen almost anywhere on warm summer evenings flitting slowly to and
fro in the twilight. During the daytime it may often be found resting upon
fences, or sitting on the leaves of low plants. In colour it is pale green,
with a peculiar milky appearance, and the eyes glow as though lighted by an
inward fire. The wings are so closely and elaborately veined that they look
like a piece of the most delicate lace-work. It is not advisable to handle
the insect, for, although perfectly harmless, it possesses the power of
pouring out from its body a liquid of the most horrible odour, which clings
to the fingers in spite of repeated ablutions.

The life-history of the lacewing-fly is very curious. When the maternal
insect lays her eggs, she first deposits a drop of a highly glutinous fluid
upon a leaf or slender twig, and then, with an upward jerk of her long
body, draws it out into a slender thread. On contact with the air this
thread immediately hardens, and just as she releases her hold the fly
attaches a single egg to the tip. In this way 200 or 300 eggs are laid
together in a little cluster, which looks just like a tiny patch of moss.
In the earlier botanical manuals, indeed, it was actually named, figured,
and described as a moss.

[Illustration: Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S.,  Regent's Park.

LARGE CADDIS-FLY.

The largest British species measures about an inch and a half across the
wings.]

The grubs which hatch out from these eggs feed upon plant-lice, of which
they devour vast numbers, draining the juices by means of their hollow
jaws, and then fastening the empty skins on their own backs, as an American
Indian might decorate himself with the scalps of his victims. Owing to this
singular habit, the grub becomes perfectly unrecognisable after the first
few days of its life, only the jaws and feet being visible beneath the pile
of dry skins. When fully fed, it changes to the pupal condition in a silken
cocoon, which it attaches to a leaf, and the perfect insect makes its
appearance in the course of a few days.

The ALDER-FLIES, in general appearance, are not unlike caddis-flies, but
may easily be distinguished by the fact that the wings are not
longitudinally folded while at rest. They are very abundant in the
neighbourhood of ponds and small streams, where they may be seen flying
slowly and heavily, or resting on low herbage or the foliage of trees and
bushes. The female insect lays her eggs in clusters of 300 or 400 on the
leaves of water-plants, and the little grubs make their way down into the
water immediately on hatching out, where they creep about on the mud at the
bottom in search of the tiny creatures on which they feed. When full-grown,
they are about an inch in length. They then leave the water and bury
themselves in the earth, where they change to pupæ, the perfect insects
emerging in June or July.

The CADDIS-FLIES, of which there are many British representatives, belong
to the Hairy-winged group. The larvæ of these insects are entirely aquatic,
and remind one of hermit-crabs, the front part of the body being clothed
with horny armour, while the hinder part is entirely unprotected. In order
to escape the attacks of predaceous insects these grubs construct cases
round their bodies, which they drag about wherever they go. In one or two
instances, however, the case is attached to the lower surface of a stone.

The materials of which these cases are made vary in accordance with the
species. In one group, for instance, they consist of pieces of twigs and
leaves, cut into short lengths, and arranged side by side in such a manner
as to form a spiral band. The larva of another kind uses entire leaves,
gluing them firmly together and living between them. A third species
employs grains of sand and tiny stones, which it arranges in the form of a
cow's horn. Most curious of all, however, is the case of a caddis-fly which
is made entirely of the shells of water-snails. As these shells are, as a
rule, still tenanted by their owners, the snails may sometimes be seen
attempting to crawl simultaneously in half a dozen different directions,
while the grub is dragging them in a seventh.

All the grubs retain tight hold of their cases by means of a pincer-like
organ at the end of the body. When fully fed, they close the aperture at
each end of the tube, and assume the chrysalis state, the perfect insects
emerging a few weeks later. Although the wings are large and broad, they
fly very slowly, and never seem to take more than a short journey through
the air. They may often be seen in numbers resting upon the herbage on the
banks of streams and ponds, or crawling down into the water in order to
deposit their eggs.



STINGING FOUR-WINGED INSECTS, OR ANTS, BEES AND WASPS, AND THEIR ALLIES

BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.

The order of insects to which the Ants, Bees, and Wasps belong includes a
very large number of species. All these are provided with four membranous
wings, alike in consistency, and provided with comparatively few nervures.
The wings are usually of small size, as compared with the dimensions of the
insects, but are very powerful, owing to the fore and hind pair being
connected together during flight by a series of little links; and the
flight of the insects is usually very rapid. These insects pass through a
perfect metamorphosis, the pupa being always inactive; the jaws are
provided with mandibles, though a proboscis, or sucking-tube, is also
present, and the abdomen of the female is armed with an ovipositor, or
boring instrument, which is frequently modified into a powerful sting, used
to deposit the eggs in their proper position. One peculiarity is that
several species of ants, bees, and wasps live in large communities, in
which the bulk of the inhabitants, on whom most of the work of the nest
falls, are imperfectly developed and usually sterile females, called
neuters, or workers. This arrangement is also met with in the White Ants,
which belong to the order of Lace-winged Insects. Among both the Ants and
White Ants the neuters are unprovided with wings; but these organs are
present in the fully developed males and females, though soon cast.

SAW-FLY.

One of the commonest of the larger British species is a blackish hairy
insect, measuring rather more than an inch in expanse, with transparent
wings bordered with brown.]

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

MARBLE GALL-FLY AND GALL.

Found on oak, and not unlike the foreign gall used for making ink.]

A great variety of other insects also belong to this order, such as
Saw-flies, Gall-flies, and an immense number of parasitic species,
generally called Ichneumon-flies, among which are some of the smallest
insects known.

This extensive order of insects is divided into two principal
sections--those in which the ovipositor is used as a saw or an auger, and
those in which it is modified into a sting. One of the most interesting
sections of the Borers includes the SAW-FLIES, in which the boring
instrument is modified into a pair of toothed saws, which are used for
cutting incisions in leaves, or in the tender bark of twigs, in which to
deposit the eggs. These flies have four transparent wings, sometimes
stained with yellow or purple, and their bodies are moderately stout and
obtuse, and generally black, red or yellow. The antennæ are very variable
in form, and are sometimes knobbed at the end like those of a butterfly;
sometimes they are formed of a number of long, slender joints; sometimes of
only three--a moderately long basal one, a short middle one, and a long
terminal one, composed of a number of joints united into one; and rarely,
as in the case of the males of some small species about half an inch long
which feed on fir and pine, the antennæ are feathered. The grubs are very
like caterpillars, and are sometimes called "false caterpillars"; but a
true caterpillar (except in one or two very rare exceptions among foreign
species) has never more than sixteen legs, while these "false caterpillars"
have more, often as many as twenty-two. They also resemble caterpillars in
another way, for the pupæ are enclosed in cocoons. One interesting
Australian species, which feeds on gum-trees, proceeds from a black
caterpillar with only six legs. The perfect insect has a blackish head and
thorax, with three large yellow spots on the latter, yellowish antennæ and
wings, and a green abdomen; it measures about an inch and a half across the
wings, and has knobbed antennæ. An allied species, found in Tasmania, is
said to tend its young larvæ--an unusual habit, except among social insects
like bees, wasps, and ants. Among the commonest and the most destructive
saw-flies in England are those feeding upon the currant, gooseberry, and
pear, of which there are several species, measuring about half an inch
across the wings. The commonest flies which lay their eggs on the
gooseberry and currant are yellow, with the head, antennæ, and three long
spots on the back black, and the wings transparent, with black veins. The
grubs are bluish green, with twenty legs, and numerous black dots; and
several may often be seen on one leaf. The best-known of the PEAR SAW-FLIES
is black, with the wings transparent, except the veins; the grub is very
like a slug, and is green or yellow, very slimy, with the front of the body
much thickened.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

TREE-WASP.

Very similar to the common wasp, but builds its nest in trees instead of in
the ground.]

The WOOD-WASPS include only a few species, the grubs of which live in the
stems of plants, or in the solid wood of trees. One of the largest feeds on
fir- or pine-trees, and the fly measures from half an inch to an inch and a
half in length, and varies much in size, though the male is generally much
smaller than the female. The female is yellow, with two black bands, and a
stout ovipositor half as long as the abdomen. In the male the tip of the
abdomen is black, and ends in a rectangular point. The wings are
transparent, with yellow nervures.

TREE-WASP'S NEST.

Generally built in a thick bush.]

Next to these insects come the GALL-FLIES, most of which produce round
galls on oaks; and in some species we meet with a wingless brood, living
alternately with the winged broods, but at the roots of the trees instead
of in the open air. The veining of the wings is reduced to one or two
veins; the antennæ are rather long, and not angulated; and the abdomen is
short, and constricted at the base. The flies seldom measure more than half
an inch across the wings. Some galls are hard, like the one found on the
Turkey oak, from which ink is made; while others are large and juicy,
resembling cherries, or small apples, among which is the so-called apple of
Sodom. Others, like the Bedeguar, which is found on roses, have a mossy
appearance. The latter are produced by a small black saw-fly, with part of
the legs, and, in the female, the base of the abdomen, red beneath.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

PINE-BORING WASP (FEMALE).

Formidable in appearance, but quite harmless.]

Some of the smaller gall-flies do not produce galls, but are parasitic on
other insects; but galls are very liable to the parasitic attacks of other
insects, especially to those of small brilliant metallic green four-winged
flies, belonging to an allied family, with very few nervures, but with a
black membranous spot on the front edge of the fore wings, and angulated
antennæ. Many galls do not begin to grow until the larva is hatched and
begins to eat.

We now come to five or six families of parasitic species, popularly called
ICHNEUMON-FLIES, and immensely numerous and varied. There are probably
considerably over 2,000 species in England alone; but they are
comparatively little known or studied. Some of these have beautifully
delicate wings, fringed with long bristles, and are among the smallest
insects known, being of quite microscopic dimensions. These are parasitic
on the eggs of various insects, and some are aquatic. But the more typical
ichneumon-flies are of larger size, often measuring more than an inch
across the wings. Their bodies are usually black or yellow, and there is
often an irregularly shaped space in the middle of the fore wing, where the
veins of the wing converge. In these flies the ovipositor is very short;
but in others it is of great length, especially in the case of the largest
British insect of this group, which is parasitic on the larvæ of the great
black-and-yellow wood-wasp, of which we have already spoken. This parasite
is as large as the wood-wasp, but much more slender; it is black, with red
legs, and two white dots on each segment of the abdomen. The ovipositor,
which looks like three black threads, is as long as the whole body.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

PINE-BORING WASP (MALE).

Smaller than the female, and very different in appearance.]

The numerous parasites of which we have spoken usually deposit their eggs
in punctures in the bodies of caterpillars or other immature insects, which
the grubs devour from within during the life of their victim, leaving it to
die when they themselves have reached their full growth.

Intermediate between the boring and stinging insects of this order comes
the small family of the RUBY-TAILED FLIES. These are brilliantly coloured
bronze-red, blue, or green metallic four-winged flies, with the thorax
covered with large depressions, and the abdomen smooth, and usually
composed, as seen from above, of one large, smooth joint, and one or two
much smaller coarsely punctured ones beyond it, the last ending in a
variable number of short teeth. They roll themselves up in a ball when
alarmed, and are parasites, depositing their eggs in the nests of other
insects. An entomologist once saw a ruby-tailed fly hurled to the ground by
a mason-bee which had built her nest in a hole in a wall. The fly rolled
herself up into a ball, when the bee bit off her wings, and then flew away.
But as soon as she was gone the wingless fly stretched herself out again,
and climbed up the wall to the bee's nest to deposit her eggs.

ICHNEUMON-FLY.

One of the largest British species of a very extensive group of parasitic
insects.]

The group of stinging insects begins with the ANTS, which are probably the
most intelligent animals now living in the world. Different species,
however, differ very much in their manners and customs, and in the grade of
civilisation to which they have attained. Some of the more industrious
among them keep other insects as cattle, and even as pets; others harvest
grain, while a few species cultivate grain for their own use; and others
make large mushroom-beds of comminuted leaves, and thus do great harm to
cultivated trees in many parts of tropical America. When the industrious
ants are not too busy, they sometimes indulge in sports and pastimes. But
there are some species which live in idle communities. Such ants are only
energetic as marauders, and are so degraded that they cannot even feed
themselves, and starve to death if they are deprived of the services of
their black slaves, which have been carried off as pupæ by the others in
piratical raids, and brought up by other slaves, which do all the work in
the nests of their captors.

Quitting the Ants, we arrive at a rather extensive series of insects of
moderate or considerable size, and with very spiny legs, called
BURROWING-WASPS. They are brightly coloured, active insects, and generally
dig holes in the ground, which they provision with caterpillars,
grasshoppers, or spiders, which they paralyse with their stings, and leave
in a moribund condition to form the food of their progeny. They are
generally winged in both sexes, but in one family the females are stout and
very hairy, and look like large hairy ants, while the males are slender
winged insects, very unlike their partners. In the burrowing-wasps the
front of the thorax, or second division of the body, is usually transverse,
and often narrow; but in the TRUE WASPS it bends back to the wings. Among
these latter it is only the small group of the SOCIAL WASPS which are
gregarious, and among which we find workers as well as males and females.
The largest of the British wasps is the HORNET; but there are several much
larger species in the East Indies, some of which are black and yellow, like
the Chinese MANDARIN-WASP, the largest of all, which often measures 2
inches across the wings. Others are black, with one large reddish band on
the abdomen. Their nests, which they construct of a kind of paper, are
formed in a hole in the ground, in a hollow tree, or in a bush, or under
the eaves of a house. A nest is commenced by a single female which has
survived the winter, and is afterwards enlarged by the exertions of her
progeny.

Generally of a brilliant metallic green or blue.]

WOOD-ANT. The largest species found in Britain.]

The last group in this order are the BEES. They may generally be easily
recognised by their shaggy bodies and legs. As with the Wasps, most species
are solitary, or live in very small communities. Some few are smooth, and
more or less metallic. A photograph of a large and beautiful South American
species appears in the Coloured Plate. The largest British bees are the
stout-bodied HUMBLE-BEES, or BUMBLE-BEES, which are generally yellow, more
or less banded with black, or else black with a red tail. They form a small
nest of cells just beneath the surface of the ground in meadows. A common
European species, not found in England, is the large black, violet-winged
CARPENTER-BEE, which makes its nest in a gallery burrowed in a post, where
there is a separate compartment for each grub.

SOLITARY ANT.
          (MALE.)                          (FEMALE.)

Not a true ant, but a burrowing-wasp, believed to be parasitic in the nests
of humble-bees.]

There are only a few species belonging to the TRUE HIVE-BEES found in
different parts of the world. They can always be distinguished from any of
the SOLITARY BEES, some of which much resemble them, by having a single
long, narrow cell, about four times as long as broad, running along the
front edge of the fore wing. In the solitary bees the corresponding cell is
much broader and shorter, rarely more than one and a half times as long as
broad, and only occupying a small portion of the front edge of the wing.

Hive-bees have always been looked upon with more interest than most other
insects, both on account of the valuable products of honey and wax which
they produce, and because of their remarkable habits. They are probably
less intelligent than ants, but they are larger; and as all classes of
their adult population are winged insects, and have been kept in a
domesticated or semi-domesticated state for many centuries, they have lent
themselves more readily to observation.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]     [_Regent's Park._

HORNET.

The largest species of true wasp found in Britain.]

The hive-bees live in very large communities, and in a state of nature they
make their nests in hollow trees or in crevices of rocks, where they build
their waxen cells, store their honey, and rear their young. There are three
classes among them,--the queen-bee, the female and the mother of the hive;
the male, or drone; and the neuter, or worker, which is really an
imperfectly developed and usually sterile female. Like other insects, bees
pass through a metamorphosis, which in their case is of the description
called "complete," for the immature forms of the bee show no resemblance
whatever to the winged insect which will finally be perfected. Every bee
commences its life in the form of an egg. Each egg is laid by the queen-bee
in a separate cell, and in a few days the egg hatches into a white footless
maggot, which is carefully tended by the workers, and fed by them with a
preparation secreted by the bees, which is carefully graduated, not only
according to the age of the grub, but is differently constituted according
to the sex and status of the bee; for it is well known that it is in the
power of the workers to develop a young grub which would otherwise become a
sterile worker into a perfect queen-bee, by placing it in a large cell, and
rearing it on the same nourishing food which is supplied to those grubs
which are intended to become perfect queens. When the grub is full-grown,
it spins itself a small silken cocoon, and becomes a pupa, or nymph, as it
is called. The pupa somewhat resembles a swathed mummy, for all the
external portions of the future bee can be seen outlined in the hard casing
which encloses it. As soon as it arrives at maturity, it makes its way out
through the upper end, when the cell is at once prepared by the other bees
for a fresh occupant. The newly born bee is at first moist, flabby, and
pale-coloured; but in a few hours her skin dries and hardens, when she at
once commences her life-long labours, at first tending the young bees and
doing other necessary duties in the hive, and then, a fortnight later,
going forth with her companions to collect honey and pollen in the meadows
and gardens.

HIVE-BEE.
(QUEEN, WORKER, AND DRONE.)

There are only about ten or twelve kinds of true hive-bees known.]

There is never room for more than one queen-bee in a hive; and the queens,
which may be recognised by their longer bodies and shorter wings, have such
a mortal hatred of each other that, whenever two of them meet, they will
fight, if permitted, until one is killed. But in summer, when young bees
are hatching daily in large numbers, and the hive is getting
over-populated, the workers do not permit the queens to fight; and finally
one of them (usually the old queen in the first instance) works herself up
into a great flurry, and rushes out of the hive, attended by several
hundred followers, to seek for fresh fields and pastures new. This is
called "swarming"; and a strong hive will often throw off as many as four
or five swarms in the course of the summer. It is then the object of the
bee-keeper to get the queen to enter a new hive, for otherwise the swarm
may fly to a distance and be lost; but wherever the queen-bee takes up her
abode, her companions will assemble round her, and at once commence the
work of building combs and storing up honey.

[Illustration: _Photo by B. H. Bentley_]     [_Sheffield._

BUMBLE-BEE ON EVERLASTING-PEA.

Bumble-bees make their nests in the ground, and live in  smaller
communities than the hive-bee.]

The drone, or male bee, is rather larger than the worker, and has a more
obtuse body. He may be at once distinguished by his long thirteen-jointed
antennæ, or feelers, for the antennæ are shorter and only twelve-jointed in
the queen and worker. There are several hundred drones in a hive; but the
queen only pairs once in her life, on the wing, and the ceremony is
immediately followed by the death of the drone. The drones have no sting,
for the sting of the female and worker is really a modified ovipositor, or
egg-laying apparatus, analogous to the organ which is so conspicuous in
many ichneumons and other insects belonging to the same order as the bees.
In the autumn the unfortunate drones are all massacred or else driven forth
from the hive by the workers, when they speedily perish. The workers are by
far the most numerous of the inhabitants of a bee-hive; there may be many
thousands of them, and their number appears to be only limited by the
dimensions of the hive itself.

The ancients had observed something of the economy of bees, but many of
their ideas on the subject were strangely fantastic. It was perhaps natural
to suppose that the leader of the bees was a king rather than a queen; but
it was also supposed that a swarm of bees could be obtained by killing an
ox and leaving the carcase to rot. This notion appears to have originated
in swarms of flies, more or less resembling bees, having been noticed
flying round or near putrefying carcases.

Among all the truly social insects--_i.e._ hive-bees, wasps, ants, and
termites, or so-called white ants--we find that the bulk of the community
consists of sterile females, and the number of fertile females is very
small, even in those cases where more than one female is permitted to live
in a nest, as among wasps.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. Reid_]     [_Wishaw, N.B._

BEES.

Swarming from the hive after the queen.]

HUMBLE-BEES live in small communities, consisting of males, females, and
workers; but their economy is very simple compared with that of the
hive-bee, and they do not confine themselves to a single female to a nest.

The SOLITARY BEES are very numerous in species, and consist only of males
and females. They do not live in communities, but each female constructs a
dwelling for her own young. Many of them burrow in the ground, and they are
so far gregarious that a large number of females will sometimes form their
burrows near each other in the same bank. There are about two hundred
different kinds of bees known to inhabit the British Isles. The solitary
bees are very varied in their habits, and some of them are parasitic on
other species.

The large CARPENTER-BEES, which form their nests in wood, are not British;
but there are some small British species which make theirs in the interior
of bramble-sticks. Some are very hairy; others are smooth, and look at
first sight like small wasps, being banded with black and yellow. But one
of the handsomest and most conspicuous of the solitary species is the
FULVOUS BEE, which is a hairy species much resembling a small humble-bee,
and is one often seen in abundance along with other bees, flying round
sallow blossoms in spring.


SCALE-WINGED INSECTS, OR BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS.

BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.

BUTTERFLIES and MOTHS are easily distinguished from other insects by many
very obvious characters, and a considerable number are remarkable for the
beautiful and varied colours of their wings. These are, as it were, tiled
with overlapping scales, attached to the membrane by a slender stem; hence
their name, Scale-winged Insects. These scales differ very much in shape,
sometimes being long and slender, and almost hair-like, while at other
times they are widened at the extremity, like a battledore, or they may be
short and broad, like a fan or a shovel. Different forms of scales are
found on different parts of the wings of the same insect; and some forms of
scale are peculiar to the male, as are usually the dense tufts of scales
found on the fore wings of the Skipper Butterflies, and on the hind wings
of the Chrysippus Butterfly. The varied colours of these scales are due
partly to pigment, interposed between the extremely delicate double or
triple tissues of which the scales are composed; or, more rarely, to the
refraction of light from the surface of the scales themselves, or, as has
recently been stated, to different coloured scales alternating so that the
varying colours are visible at different angles, as in the metallic "shot"
colour of the Purple Emperor Butterfly, and in various species found in
South America and other countries. In the case of the Purple Emperor, and
in many other butterflies, this "shot" colouring is confined to the males.
Indeed, as a rule, female butterflies and moths are larger than the males,
but far less brilliantly coloured than their mates. There are, however,
many species in which the sexes differ little in size or colour; but it
only rarely happens that the female is more brightly coloured than the
male.

The bodies of butterflies and moths, the legs, and often more or less of
the base or borders of the wings are clothed with hair or hair-like scales.
These insects have a long or short proboscis, through which they imbibe
their food, which consists of the honey of flowers, the sap of trees, or
moisture from the ground. Like other insects, they have six legs in the
perfect state; but in some species either the front or hind pair becomes
more or less rudimentary, especially in the males.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. Edwards_]     [_Colesborne._

LEAF-BUTTERFLY.

These butterflies are so remarkably like certain leaves that it is almost
impossible to distinguish the difference even at close quarters.]

Butterflies and moths pass through four stages. The egg is laid by the
female on some plant which will provide suitable nourishment for the
caterpillar. A caterpillar, which is the next stage, is a jointed,
worm-like creature with sixteen legs; those corresponding with the legs of
the perfect insect are horny, and a pair is placed on each of the first
three joints behind the head. The next four pairs, called "prolegs," are
thick and fleshy, and a pair is placed under each of joints seven to ten
(reckoning the head as joint one), the last joint of all being provided
with a pair slightly differing from the others, and called "claspers." In
many young caterpillars, however, and also in the full-grown caterpillars
of a considerable number of moths (especially among those with slender
bodies), one or more of the first three pairs of pro-legs may be
rudimentary or absent, and the caterpillar walks by arching its back at
every step, in a way that must be seen to be appreciated, though such
caterpillars (popularly called Loopers, on account of the way they loop up
their bodies in walking) are often very active, and cover the ground much
more rapidly than one might imagine. Sometimes the claspers, or last pair
of legs, are modified into tentacles, which, in the caterpillars of the
Puss-moth and its allies, contain retractile whips, used as weapons of
defence.

Caterpillars are very voracious, and increase in size with great rapidity;
and whenever their skin gets too tight, after splitting it, they slip it
off (along with the lining of the stomach and intestines), and after a few
hours' lethargy, necessary to recover from the debilitating effects of such
a serious operation, and to give the new skin time to dry and harden, they
begin to feed again as voraciously as ever. The number of these moults
varies according to the species; when the caterpillar has attained its full
growth, it enters upon the third stage of its life as a pupa, or chrysalis.

A pupa means a doll, or swaddled baby, and is a very appropriate name for
the dark-coloured object, cased in a horny skin, with no detached organs
visible, except the sheath for the proboscis in some of the Hawk-moths, in
which this organ is unusually long, but with the separate cases of the
wings, legs, etc., of the future butterfly or moth plainly visible in the
sutures on its surface. The pupæ of some butterflies have more or less
metallic colours; and to these only is the term "chrysalis" applicable.

Some pupæ are naked, and those of most butterflies are either suspended by
the tail, or attached to a branch by a belt of silk round the body. Those
of moths are generally formed either in an earthen cell under the surface
of the ground, or else are enclosed in an oval case called a "cocoon,"
chiefly composed of silk, though sometimes moss or chips of wood are worked
into it. Other pupæ are found between leaves, or, in the case of
caterpillars which feed in the wood of trees, or in the stems of plants, in
the galleries where they have lived.

When the perfect butterfly or moth is ready to emerge, the pupa splits, and
the insect works its way to the open air. Its body is limp and heavy, and
the wings are like little flaps of wet rag; but it discharges a quantity of
superfluous fluid, generally of a red colour, and fixes itself on a branch,
or other convenient foothold, where its wings can hang downwards. The
expansion and contraction of the muscles pump air into the hollow tubes
which form the framework of the wings; these rapidly expand to their full
size, and become dry and firm at the same time. After this, the insect
flies about with its companions, pairs, lays its eggs, and then dies, after
enjoying its life for a period, varying according to the species and the
season, from a few hours to several months.

We have not yet spoken of the feelers, or antennæ, of butterflies and
moths. They are two long, jointed organs, nearly always knobbed at the end
in butterflies, or at least the terminal joints are thicker than the rest.
But in moths the antennæ are of different shapes, and generally end in a
point. Sometimes they are simple and thread-like; sometimes they are
thickest in the middle, and thinner at both ends, as in the Hawk-moths; and
they are often comb-like, especially in the males, as in the Silk-moths.

CATERPILLAR OF TAWNY ADMIRAL.

Remarkable for the sharply contrasted black and pale markings.]

As already mentioned, butterflies may be distinguished from moths by their
antennæ being thickened at the extremities. There are comparatively few
species in Europe--only about three hundred, of which between sixty and
seventy are met with in the British Islands; but in tropical countries they
are much more numerous and varied. It is a mistake to suppose that
butterflies are always bright-coloured insects, and moths the reverse; for
though many butterflies are brightly coloured, others are very dingy. On
the other hand, although it is equally true that many moths are
dull-coloured, others, especially among those with slender bodies, or those
which fly by day, are quite as brilliantly coloured as any butterflies.

BLUE BUTTERFLY.

Among the most conspicuous of the smaller European butterflies.]

Butterflies are divided into several groups, the first of which includes
the BRUSH-FOOTED BUTTERFLIES, so called because the front pair of legs is
converted into hairy paws, useless for walking, and only employed for
toilet purposes. This is a very extensive group, including about half the
butterflies known, and is divided into several smaller sections. The most
interesting species among the DANAIDS is the MONARCH, one of the largest
and commonest butterflies found in North America. It is migratory in its
habits, and has succeeded in acclimatising itself throughout the Pacific
islands as far as Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the Canaries;
and so many specimens have been taken recently in the south of England that
it seems not unlikely to take up its residence there also. It is a tawny
butterfly, not unlike the one represented on the preceding page, but much
larger, measuring about 5 inches across the wings. The caterpillar is
yellow, with transverse black bands, and a pair of long, black slender
filaments near each extremity of the body. The pupa is pale green, with
golden spots, and is suspended by the tail, as is the case with most of
those of the Brush-footed Butterflies.

The next group, the LONG-WINGED BUTTERFLIES, includes a considerable number
of species with long rounded wings, found in tropical and sub-tropical
America. A species with black and transparent markings is shown on page
710, but many have wholly transparent wings, except for a narrow black or
brown border.

BLUE MORPHO BUTTERFLY AND HUMMING-BIRD.

Turning to more familiar insects, there are several kinds of large or
moderate-sized tawny butterflies, marked with black spots and lines, called
FRITILLARIES in England. The caterpillars are spiny, and feed on violets
and other low-growing plants. The photograph on page 710 shows the DIANA
FRITILLARY, a large and handsome species, which is somewhat of a rarity in
the Southern States of America; it measures 4 inches in expanse, and the
sexes are very dissimilar. It is dark brown, with a broad orange border
spotted with black in the male, and rows of more or less connected green or
white spots in the female.

The ANGLE-WINGED BUTTERFLIES include several of the best known and most
brightly coloured British species, such as the RED ADMIRAL, a velvety black
butterfly, with a transverse red band on the fore wings, and several white
spots between this and the tip, the hind wings having a red border, spotted
with black and blue. It measures about 2½ inches across the wings, and is
common in gardens and orchards in summer and autumn. The caterpillar, which
feeds on nettle, is brown or black, with yellow stripes and spines. The
TAWNY ADMIRAL is a North American butterfly, remarkable for its resemblance
to the larger butterfly called the Monarch, of which we have already
spoken. The Danaids and Long-winged Butterflies have tough integuments and
a disagreeable odour, which more or less protects them from birds. Many
other butterflies belonging to other families have a superficial
resemblance to these, and are believed to share in their immunity. This
phenomenon is technically called "mimicry." The caterpillar of the tawny
admiral is grey and black, with curious spiny tufts.

The group of the SATYRS contains a great variety of moderate-sized brown or
tawny butterflies, usually with round spots centred with white towards the
margins of the wings. Many species are common in meadows; others, which are
dark brown or black, with red, white-centred marginal spots, are numerous
in mountainous countries, and two species are found in the north of England
and Scotland. The caterpillars of the Satyrs are usually smooth and green,
with a forked tail, and the pupæ are formed on the surface of the ground.

The great BLUE BUTTERFLIES of South America form another group of
Brush-footed Butterflies.

The second family is almost entirely American, and is only represented in
England by a brown butterfly about an inch in expanse, called the DUKE OF
BURGUNDY FRITILLARY. The caterpillar is reddish, and feeds on primroses. It
is not a very abundant species in England.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

NEW GUINEA GOLDEN BUTTERFLY.

A remarkable and recently discovered swallow-tailed butterfly.]

The third family is represented in Britain by three very distinct sections
of rather small butterflies, the largest of which scarcely measures more
than an inch and a half across the wings. These are the HAIR-STREAKS
(brown, with light lines on the under surface of the wings, and a short
tail on the hind wings, except in the GREEN HAIR-STREAK, so named from the
green under surface of the wings); the small BLUE BUTTERFLIES, which
generally have brown females; and the COPPERS, the only common species of
which measures about an inch across the wings. The fore wings are bright
coppery red, with dark brown spots and borders, and the hind wings are dark
brown, with a coppery red border, spotted outside with black. The small
copper butterfly and some of the blues are common in meadows and gardens.

Many of the members of the fourth family are of a white or yellow colour,
among which are the destructive WHITE CABBAGE-BUTTERFLIES, three species of
which are very common in England, where they may be seen in every garden
throughout the summer. The photograph on page 716 represents one of these
at rest. A prettier species is the ORANGE-TIP, which is common in spring.
The underside of the hind wings is mottled with green; and there is a
bright orange spot before the tip of the fore wing, both above and below.
Some of the South American butterflies of this family much resemble the
Long-winged Butterflies of the same country.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

AUSTRALIAN BUTTERFLIES.

Emerging from their pupæ.]

The family of the SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLIES includes a considerable number
of large and handsome species, but they are not numerous in Europe, and
only one black-and-yellow species, measuring 3 inches across the wings, is
found in England, where it is now almost confined to the fens of the
south-eastern counties; its green caterpillar, with transverse black bands
spotted with orange, feeds on carrot, fennel, and other similar plants. All
the caterpillars of this family are remarkable for possessing a retractile
fork on the neck; but the butterflies do not all possess the long appendage
to the hind wings which has given some of them the name of Swallow-tails.
Thus it is wanting in most of the great BIRD-WINGED BUTTERFLIES of the
Eastern Islands, one of which, the CROESUS BUTTERFLY, is represented in the
Coloured Plate. The great difference between the sexes is well worth
noting. The female is considerably larger than the male, but in the
coloured figure the former has been reduced, owing to the exigencies of
space. Mr. A. R. Wallace writes as follows of the capture of the first
specimen:--

The cabbage-butterfly referred to on page 715.]

"One day about the beginning of January, I found a beautiful shrub with
large white leafy bracts and yellow flowers, a species of Mussænda, and saw
one of these noble insects hovering over it, but it was too quick for me,
and flew away. The next day I went again to the same shrub and succeeded in
catching a female, and the day after a fine male. I found it to be as I had
expected, a perfectly new and most magnificent species, and one of the most
gorgeously coloured butterflies in the world. Fine specimens of the male
are more than seven inches across the wings, which are velvety black and
fiery orange, the latter colour replacing the green of the allied species.
The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable, and none but a
naturalist can understand the intense excitement I experienced when I at
length captured it. On taking it out of my net and opening the glorious
wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I
felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of
immediate death. I had a headache the rest of the day, so great was the
excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very inadequate
cause."

[Illustration: _Photo by J. Edwards_]     [_Colesborne._

BLACK-VEINED WHITE BUTTERFLY.

A much rarer species in England now than formerly.]

The SKIPPERS, the last family of butterflies, are comparatively
stout-bodied insects, with the antennæ widely apart at the base, and
sometimes forked at the tip. They are not numerous in Europe; the prettiest
of the British species is perhaps the PEARL-SKIPPER, which measures rather
more than an inch across its brown and tawny wings; the under surface of
the hind wings is green, and marked with several clear white spots.


MOTHS.

Moths are much more numerous than butterflies, and there are about 2,000
different kinds found in the British Islands alone. Consequently we are
able to notice only a few.

The HAWK-MOTHS have long, pointed wings, thick, tapering bodies, and the
antennæ thickest in the middle. The pink, greenish-striped ELEPHANT
HAWK-MOTH (see page 718) is a comparatively small species. The specimens
measure about 2½ inches across the wings. Some species are much larger. The
DEATH'S-HEAD HAWK-MOTH, whose caterpillar feeds on potato-leaves, is 5 or 6
inches in expanse; and some of the South American species measure as much
as 9 inches. The caterpillars of the hawk-moths are generally green, often
with oblique lines of a different colour on the sides. They are not hairy,
though the skin is sometimes rough, and there is a fleshy appendage, called
a "horn," on the back, just before the extremity of the body. The brown
pupæ are found in cells in the ground.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. C. Atkinson._

ORANGE-TIP.

Showing three different positions when wings are folded, and partly or

The CHINESE MULBERRY-SILKWORM, which produces most of the silk of commerce,
is a smooth, whitish caterpillar, about 2 inches long, with a horn. It is
often reared in England on lettuce. The moth is a sluggish, stout-bodied
insect. It is whitish, with two dusky stripes on the fore wings. The pupa
is enclosed in an oval whitish or yellow cocoon of pure silk.

SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLY

The only British species of this butterfly is almost confined to the fen
districts of Norfolk.]

The EMPEROR-MOTHS, of which there is only one species in England, likewise
spin large cocoons, sometimes used for commercial purposes. The
caterpillars are generally more or less spiny or tufted. Some of the moths
have long tails on the hind wings, like swallow-tailed butterflies, and
there are several species in South Europe, South Africa, the East Indies,
and North America of a beautiful sea-green colour. It will be noticed that
the specimens represented on page 718 have the tails a little broken, which
is a very common accident with swallow-tailed butterflies and moths. We may
also notice the round or crescent-shaped spots in the middle of the wings
of some of the moths represented on this page and the next. These are very
characteristic of the emperor-moths, and there is often a transparent spot
in the centre of the concentric markings. Two other North American species
of this family are shown in the photographs on page 719, rather under
natural size. The second of these, the CECROPIA MOTH, is represented with
its cocoon. This moth has occasionally been captured in England, having
been introduced either accidentally or by design. A year or two ago a
specimen was brought to the Natural History Museum at South Kensington
which had been caught in the street close by. During the summer many
foreign butterflies and moths may be seen alive in the Insect-house at the
Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, and several of the photographs given in
these pages were taken from specimens living there in the summer of 1901.
The largest of the emperor-moths is the great ATLAS MOTH of North India,
the largest of all known butterflies or moths, which occasionally measures
almost a foot across its reddish-tawny wings.

The EGGARS form another allied family, also with tufted caterpillars, but
with the central eye of the wings absent, or reduced to a small black spot.
A set of remarkable photographs, representing the eggs, caterpillars,
cocoons and sections of cocoons, and the moths of a large and handsome
species--the CYPRESS-MOTH of Smyrna--appears on pages 720 and 721. We have
received the following account of their habits from Mr. Mavroyeni, to whom
we are indebted for the photographs: "In the month of July they start
weaving their cocoons, in which they remain for seventeen days. A couple of
weeks after the moths have emerged from their cocoons and laid their eggs,
the eggs hatch, and the young caterpillars run up the tree, and feed from
the end of August, during autumn, winter, and spring." We believe that the
cocoons of this species are prepared for use as silk in Greece.

Among other kinds, we may notice the bright-coloured TIGER-MOTHS, with
their black and cream-coloured fore wings and red-and-black hind wings,
which frequent gardens, and are reared from reddish-brown caterpillars with
long hair. These are stout-bodied moths; and there are other moths, with
brown fore wings and whitish hind wings, which fly to candles, or buzz over
flowers in the evening. These are called OWL-MOTHS; but there are larger
and handsomer members of the same family, called YELLOW UNDERWINGS,
measuring nearly 2 inches across the wings, and likely to be flushed in
strawberry-beds or hay-fields. They have brown fore wings, and bright
yellow hind wings, with a black border. The RED-UNDERWING MOTH is about 3
inches in expanse, and has greyish-brown fore wings, and red hind wings,
with a black central band; it is often seen flying about willow-trees in
the afternoon, or resting on tree-trunks, when the bright-coloured hind
wings are quite concealed.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

COCOONS OF CYPRESS-MOTH.

These yield silk.]

The LOOPER-MOTHS are those produced from caterpillars which have only ten
legs instead of sixteen, as already explained. Most have slender bodies of
moderate length, and broad and rather brightly coloured wings, green,
russet-brown, yellow, etc. Some, measuring about an inch in expanse, are
called CARPET-MOTHS, from the zigzag patterns on the fore wings, which are
generally black and white, or brown and white, and sometimes green. The
YELLOW-SHELL, a yellow moth, with some zigzag brown and whitish lines
across the wings, which expand about an inch, is common in hedges and
bushes. The white, black-and-yellow-spotted GOOSEBERRY-MOTH, or
MAGPIE-MOTH, so common in gardens, is also one of the Loopers.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

CYPRESS-MOTHS AT REST.

In the month of July they start weaving their cocoons, in which they remain
for seventeen days. A couple of weeks after their eggs are hatched, and the
young caterpillars run up the tree, and feed from the end of August, during
autumn, winter, and spring.]

Among the smaller moths are the PEARL-MOTHS, with long slender bodies,
wings longer than broad, and often with a pearly lustre, one or two species
of which are common among nettles. We may also mention the SNOUT-MOTH, a
brown slender-bodied moth, with a pointed beak projecting in front of the
head, likewise a common insect among nettles. The GRASS-MOTHS are small
moths, with narrow whitish fore wings, and broad brownish hind wings, which
they wrap round their bodies when at rest. They are common in every field
and meadow. The BELL-MOTHS have broad truncated fore wings, and rounded
hind wings. A species belonging to this family, with green fore wings and
brown hind wings, may be shaken from every oak-tree in summer, and at the
same time numbers of its little green caterpillars will drop themselves
down, and remain swinging at the end of a thread, till they think that the
danger is past, when they climb up again.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

CYPRESS-MOTHS.

The CLOTHES-MOTHS, familiar to everybody, are representatives of an
enormous family of small moths, comprising nearly two-thirds of the British
species, but only a few live in houses. Most have narrow wings with long
fringes, and many feed in tortuous galleries which they eat in the
substance of leaves. Some are among the smallest moths known.

The WHITE PLUME-MOTH, which may be noticed floating about in weedy places
like a piece of thistle-down, is a representative of a small family in
which the fore wings are divided into three separate feathers, and the hind
wings into two. The other species are brown, and smaller. When at rest,
they look like small daddy-long-legs.

The TWENTY-PLUME MOTH is a yellowish-grey species, less than an inch in
expanse, often to be seen at rest on windows or palings. It might easily be
taken for a small looper-moth, but that each wing is split into six
feathers.


SILKWORMS.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

CYPRESS-CATERPILLARS.

When they leave their cocoons, the young caterpillars run up the tree to
feed.]

We have now completed a rapid survey of the principal groups of Butterflies
and Moths, and may fittingly conclude this part of our subject by giving a
short account of the history of SILKWORMS--insects which far surpass all
other butterflies and moths in their importance to mankind, on account of
the valuable product which is obtained from their cocoons. The industry has
been carried on from time immemorial in China; and many old Chinese works
contain interesting particulars, especially relating to the rearing of
silkworms by the queens and their ladies, for silk was probably a royal
monopoly in old times. These Chinese records date back to about 2200 B.C.,
when the silk industry was already flourishing; but, according to the
usually received tradition, silkworms were first reared during the reign of
the Emperor Hwang-té (2640 B.C.) by his queen. The following extracts from
the "Le-he Book of Ceremonies," written between 204 B.C. and 135 B.C., and
quoted by Horsfield and Moore in their "Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the
East India Museum," may not be uninteresting to our renders:--

[Illustration: _Photo by J. Peat Millar_]     [_Beith._

DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH.

Remarkable for the skull-like pattern on the back.]

"In the first month of spring orders were issued to the forester not to cut
down the mulberry-trees; and when the cooing doves were observed fluttering
with their wings, and the crested jays alighting upon the mulberry-trees,
people were to prepare the trays and frames for the purpose of rearing the
silkworms.

DAY-FLYING MOTH OF MADAGASCAR.

Remarkable for the brilliancy of its colours--green and black, with the

"In the spring season, when the empress and her ladies had fasted, they
proceeded to the east, and personally engaged in picking the
mulberry-leaves. On this occasion the married and single ladies were
forbidden to wear their ornaments, and the usual employments of females
were lessened, in order to encourage attention to the silkworms. When the
rearing of the silkworms was completed, the cocoons were divided (for
reeling) and the silk weighed (for weaving), each person being rewarded
according to her labour, in order to provide dresses for the celestial and
ancestorial sacrifices. In all this none dared indulge in indolence.

"In the last month of summer the order was given to the female officers to
dye the silk of various colours, in order to weave chequered sarcenets,
comprising black and white, black and green, green and red, with
red-and-white checks--all of which was to be done according to the ancient
rule, without the least variation; the black, yellow, azure, and red tints
were all to be correct and good, without the least fault, in order to
provide dresses for the celestial and ancestorial sacrifices, and standards
for distinguishing the high and low degrees.

WHITE PLUME-MOTH.

A very delicate insect. The wings are cleft almost to the base into

"In ancient times the emperor and his princes had a public mulberry garden
and a silkworm establishment erected near some river. On the morning of the
first day of the third month of spring, the sovereign, wearing a leather
cap and a plain garment, ascertained by lot the chief of his three queens,
with the most honourable amongst his concubines, and caused them to attend
to the rearing of the silkworms in the above-named establishment. They then
brought the eggs of the worms, and washed them in the river above alluded
to, after which they picked the mulberry-leaves in the public garden, and
aired and dried them, in order to feed the worms.

Resembles the American Luna Moth figured on page 718, and of an equally

"When the season was over, the royal concubines, having completed the
business of rearing the silkworms, brought the cocoons to show them to the
prince, when he presented the cocoons again to his consort, whereupon his
consort said, 'This is the material of which your highness's robes are to
be formed.' Having said which, she covered herself with her robe, and
received the cocoons. On this occasion the ladies of the court were
honoured with the present of a sheep. This was the mode in which the
presentation of the cocoons was anciently conducted."

In the reign of Justinian eggs of the Chinese mulberry-silkworm were
smuggled into Europe by two monks, and the culture of silk rapidly spread
through Southern Europe, where it has continued to form a staple industry
ever since. In the Peloponnesus especially such large plantations of
mulberry-trees were grown for the purpose of rearing silkworms as to give
the peninsula its modern name of Morea. Silk is obtained in different parts
of the world from the cocoons of various other moths, chiefly belonging to
the group of Emperor-moths; but these products are only of local
importance, and are not likely to compete with the mulberry-silkworm.



HALF-WINGED INSECTS, OR BUGS AND FROG-HOPPERS.

BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.

[Illustration: _Photos by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S._]

SHIELD-BUG.

In tropical countries these bugs are often as large as cockchafers.]

[Illustration: JUNIPER-BUG.

Some species of this family are carnivorous as well as herbivorous.]

The order including the Bugs and Frog-hoppers is divided into two
sub-orders. There are also one or two small groups, sometimes treated as
separate orders, and sometimes regarded as aberrant sections of the order,
to which we shall allude later.

The TRUE BUGS have their fore wings of a horny texture, but generally
overlapping, and the extremities form a transparent membrane, resembling
that of the hind wings. They have a long sucking-proboscis curved down
beneath their bodies, and their antennæ usually consist of only four or
five long joints. Most are vegetable-feeders, but some species feed on the
juices of other insects, while a few attack warm-blooded animals, either
casually or habitually.

The first family includes the SHIELD-BUGS. These derive their name from the
unusual development of a part of the thorax called the "scutellum." In most
insects it is only a small plate of no great importance, attached to the
end of the thorax; but in the Shield-bugs it forms a great solid arch,
covering the whole of the wings, and protecting them as the wing-cases
protect the wings of beetles. There are only a few small species in
England, but a great number of beautiful species inhabit warm countries,
some of a brilliant blue or green or yellow, or spotted. Many of them are
comparatively large insects, nearly an inch long, and resemble brilliantly
coloured beetles, from which, however, they can easily be distinguished by
the antennæ, the proboscis, and the shield, the latter of which is not
divided down the middle like the wing-cases of beetles.

LACE-WING BUG.

An elegant little insect, injurious to pear-trees.]

Next to the Shield-bugs, and considered by many entomologists as belonging
to the same group, are the PENTAGONAL SHIELD-BUGS, so called because the
scutellum, though much smaller than in the Shield-bugs, is often half as
long as the abdomen, and forms a broad triangle, sometimes broken at the
sides, so as to make a five-sided plate, lying above the bases of the
wings. Several green or brown species of this family, about half an inch
long, are common in England among bushes. Many have a very disagreeable
smell, and hence they are called STINK-BUGS in America. They feed on
vegetable juices, and also frequently on soft-bodied insects. Several
species (chiefly foreign) among the Shield-bugs and the present group have
a strong spine, or else a blunt protuberance, projecting from each
shoulder.

The remaining plant-bugs are much more numerous--at least in England--than
those already mentioned, and form several families, which cannot be noticed
in detail. Many species are rather small and delicate creatures, narrower
and softer than the Shield-bugs and Pentagonal Shield-bugs, and are adorned
with various colours, black and red predominating. Some have more
transparent wings than the others, such as the beautiful little LACE-WINGED
BUGS, one species of which is often very destructive to pear-trees.

The BED-BUG is a reddish-brown, somewhat oval insect, common in many old
houses, hiding in cracks and crevices in walls and woodwork, and coming out
at night to suck the blood of sleepers with its sharp proboscis. There are
allied species, sometimes found in hen-houses, pigeon-houses, and places
where bats congregate. The bed-bug has only been known in England for a few
centuries, and though now a great pest in all parts of the world, was
probably a native of Africa originally.

The bed-bug, notwithstanding its offensive odour, is preyed upon by several
other insects, among which are the common cockroach and the MASKED BUG. The
latter is a black-winged bug about three-quarters of an inch long, and
remarkable for the habits of its larva, which conceals itself with dust or
fluff, so that it may steal upon its prey unobserved. The masked bug and
its larva feed on soft-bodied insects of various kinds, and are more
frequently found in outhouses than in dwelling-rooms. This bug occasionally
attacks warm-blooded animals; and a short time ago a great deal of nonsense
was published in the newspapers about a mysterious insect-pest in North
America, called the KISSING-BUG, which seems to have been nothing more
unusual than this insect. There are, however, some much larger species
belonging to the same family, which are formidable pests in the Southern
States of North America, Chili, and various other countries.

[Illustration: _Photo by P. Danado, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

MASKED BUG.

The larvæ of these insects cover themselves with dust, in order to creep
upon their prey unnoticed.]

After these insects come the WATER-BUGS, of which there are several
families, though the number of species is comparatively small. Some are
very slender insects, with long, slender legs, and may be seen running on
the surface of ponds in England; while others, which are tropical species,
are marine, and are met with running on the surface of the water in the
open sea.

The largest members of the group are some of the great water-bugs found in
Africa, India, and America. Their fore wings are of a light brown, and
measure from 3 to 5 inches in expanse. Their legs are short and strong, and
the front legs are adapted for grasping their prey, which consists of
insects and small fishes. There are some smaller species in which the
female lays her eggs in a cluster on the back of the male, which carries
them about till they are hatched. These bugs fly about in the evening, and
are frequently attracted by electric light.

In England there are two allied species called WATER-SCORPIONS, from their
long front legs, which somewhat resemble the nippers of a scorpion. The
commonest is a brown insect, with the abdomen red beneath. It is about an
inch long, including the breathing-tube, which sticks out behind the body
like a tail, and is formed of two separable parts. It is an oval insect,
half as broad as long, and is common in stagnant water. The other species
is twice as long, and is much more slender, with longer and more slender
legs. It is yellowish brown, like most of the other water-bugs, and is a
sluggish and rather scarce insect, creeping about in the mud at the bottom
of deeper water than that preferred by the commoner species.

The WATER-BOATMEN are yellowish-brown insects, measuring half an inch in
length, with smooth bodies, and long, hairy hind legs, with which they row
themselves about on the water, as if with oars, while floating on their
backs. All the larger water-bugs are capable of inflicting a severe
puncture with their sharp proboscis, if handled incautiously.

These insects live in water during the day, and fly about in the evening.]

The FROG-HOPPERS and their allies differ from the Bugs in the fore wings
being uniform in texture throughout, and not membranous, with the tips
transparent. Sometimes the fore wings are of a more or less horny texture,
but they are frequently as transparent as the hind wings. All the species
are plant-feeding insects.

[Illustration: _Photo by J. Edwards_]     [_Colesborne._

INDIAN CANDLE-FLY.

Erroneously stated to be luminous.]

The first family, the CICADAS, includes a number of large or moderate-sized
species, in which the males are provided with a large, drum-like apparatus
on the abdomen, and some of which make the loud noise for which they have
long been celebrated. There is only one comparatively small species in
England, which is rare, and almost confined to the New Forest. It is black,
with transparent wings, about 1½ inch in expanse, and has red transverse
lines on the abdomen. The largest Indian species, however, sometimes
expands 8 inches. Cicadas have broad heads, broad short bodies, ending
rather abruptly in a point, and their larvæ live in the ground, where they
are sometimes injurious to the roots of trees. The wings are usually, but
not always, transparent--a very common Indian and Chinese species, about 3
inches in expanse, being black, with large yellow spots on the fore wings.
In North America and Australia cicadas are often miscalled Locusts.

The LANTERN-FLIES, or CANDLE-FLIES, which form the next family, derive
their name from having been stated to be luminous, a statement which is now
considered very doubtful. They are insects of considerable size and bright
colours, occasionally resembling butterflies and moths; the largest
species, the LANTERN-FLY of South America, sometimes measures as much as 5
inches across the wings, which are of a pale yellowish or greenish tint,
with a large round spot on the hind wings, formed of black rings or
crescents, and enclosing one or two large white spots. On the head is an
immense hollow, blunt protuberance, marked with one or two longitudinal red
lines. In some species there is a curved horn in front of the head; in some
the horn forms a short cross; in others it ends in a red knob; while others
are destitute of such an appendage. The hind wings are often brightly
coloured, red or yellow usually predominating.

The TRUE FROG-HOPPERS are small insects about a quarter of an inch long,
found among grass and bushes. The fore wings are of rather a stout
consistency and uniform in colour (often yellowish), and the hind wings
transparent. The larvæ are soft grubs, and live in the masses of froth so
common in grass and bushes, which are vulgarly known as "cuckoo-spit."

Passing over several families of small species, we arrive at two which
contain many very destructive insects. The APHIDES, PLANT-LICE, or
SMOTHER-FLIES are the small green or brown winged or wingless insects which
frequently cover the shoots of roses and other trees and plants, and exude
a sweet sticky substance, called "honey-dew," very attractive to ants. One
species, known as the AMERICAN BLIGHT, is extremely destructive to
apple-trees, patches of a substance resembling white cotton appearing on
the bark. Under these patches the bark rots from the attacks of the
insects, the pest being very difficult to eradicate.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

SCALE-INSECTS.

Showing their appearance when crowded together on a branch.]

Many of the Aphides exhibit the curious phenomenon known as "alternation of
generations." The first brood consists of winged males and females; but the
eggs which the latter lay produce exclusively wingless females, or rather
sexless creatures capable of laying eggs, and these multiply indefinitely
for a time, till perfect males and females are again reproduced. In some
cases the winged forms live on the leaves of trees, and the wingless forms
at the roots of grass, etc. One of the most destructive of all these
insects is the VINE-APHIS, which was probably introduced into Europe from
America, and which threatened at one time almost to destroy the vine
industry in France. Wingless sexless forms live and multiply at the roots
of vines; and in summer winged males and females are produced, which fly
up, and lay eggs on the leaves; while some of the wingless insects also
quit the ground, and form small galls on the vine-leaves. Although very
abundant in America, the insect is not nearly so destructive to the plants
which it attacks as in Europe.

Some species of SCALE-INSECTS are almost equally destructive, especially to
greenhouse plants. The male is slender and two-winged, but the female is
wingless and often legless, and after depositing her eggs usually dies
above them, thus forming a covering to protect them from injury. Cochineal
consists of the bodies of a species of scale-insect which infests the
leaves of a cactus in Mexico.

The TRUE LICE are found on various species of mammals, and imbibe their
food through a proboscis. The BIRD-LICE, or BITING-LICE, form a
well-defined group by themselves. They are sometimes regarded as forming
distinct orders of insects; but some authors treat the first group as a
degraded family of insects allied to the Frog-hoppers, and the second group
as an equally degraded and aberrant family allied to the Lace-winged
Insects.


TWO-WINGED INSECTS, OR FLIES.

BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.

This order of insects is probably one of the most numerous in individuals,
though it may be that, when we know more of the insect population of the
world, we shall find that it is outnumbered in species by the Beetles or
the order to which the Bees and Ants belong. It differs from all other
orders in possessing only two wings instead of four, which is the usual
number in insects. The metamorphoses are complete, and the mouth is
furnished with a proboscis for imbibing liquid food. Hind wings are
represented in many species by a pair of organs called "poisers,"
resembling a knob at the end of a stick, and other species have two small
additional lobes attached to the wing, called "winglets "; but there is no
such thing as a really developed hind wing in any insect belonging to the
group. They are always two-winged flies, except in the case of a few
aberrant species, such as the Fleas, in which no wings, or only mere
rudiments of wings, are to be met with. The Gnats, Daddy-long-legs, and
House-flies are among the commonest representatives of this order.

[Illustration: _Photo by C. N. Mavroyeni_]     [_Smyrna._

CICADA AND PUPÆ.

Noted for the loud drumming sound produced by the males.]

The first section of the group includes the GNATS and the DADDY-LONG-LEGS,
or CRANE-FLIES, the members of which may be distinguished by having
moderately long antennæ, composed of more than six joints, and never
terminating in a bristle. They are all vegetable-feeders, with the
exception of the females of gnats and sand-flies, which are furnished with
a lancet-like arrangement for sucking the blood of warm-blooded animals.

The GALL-FLIES, WHEAT-MIDGES, etc., have rather long, jointed antennæ,
which are not feathered, though sometimes tufted on the sides, and their
maggots produce small galls on various trees and plants, or distort and
otherwise injure them. They resemble small gnats, and there are two
particularly destructive species which attack corn in England and
elsewhere,--the WHEAT-MIDGE, an orange-yellow fly with black eyes, which
produces little yellowish or reddish maggots which injure the growing grain
in the ear; and the HESSIAN FLY, which is brown, and produces
semi-transparent maggots, which afterwards grow darker, and when full grown
become pupæ resembling flax-seeds. The maggots attack the stalk, feeding on
the sap till the stalk cracks and bends over. This is an infallible sign of
their presence, and of the mischief they are doing.

Among the best-known insects of this group are the GNATS, or MOSQUITOES, of
which there are many genera and species. There is no difference, however,
to permit of their being classified in two separate popular categories. In
England any of these troublesome insects are called Gnats; out of England
they are termed Mosquitoes, if we are tormented by them, even though they
may belong to the same species as the English ones--for "mosquito" is
merely the Spanish word for "gnat" Anglicised.

[Illustration: BROWN MOSQUITO.

Observe the proboscis in front of the head.]

Gnats breed in standing water, fresh or otherwise, but seem to prefer
rain-water, for they are very numerous about small pools and water-butts.
Consequently they were formerly far more abundant in England than at
present, when the fens were still undrained, and when every house had its
rain-water butt. The females of some species construct small rafts of eggs,
which float about on the surface of the water till hatched, and then
produce small maggots with a breathing-apparatus at the end of the tail. In
this condition they swim head-downwards, while the more compact pupa floats
head-upwards. They may be destroyed by pouring a little kerosene into their
breeding-places; and as this floats on the surface of the water, it does
not interfere with the use of the water in water-butts, which is usually
drawn off by a tap below. The males of gnats often have feathered antennæ
and long, slender legs. The females, however, are more nocturnal in their
habits, and come into houses in the evening, and keep people awake by their
humming and painful "bites," or rather punctures, which frequently cause a
distressing irritation for a day or two afterwards. What is worse is that
they are now known to disseminate various diseases, such as elephantiasis
and also malarial fever of every kind, in this manner--from the
comparatively mild ague of the English fens (now nearly extinct) to the
terrible malaria of Southern Europe, India, and Africa, formerly attributed
to the unhealthy atmosphere of marshy countries, or to exposure to the
night air in warm countries, but now known to be caused by the bites of the
gnats, or mosquitoes, which breed in swampy places, and fly about in the
evening. It is believed that only certain species of gnats convey the germs
of these diseases; and it has been stated that, though ague-bearing species
of gnats are still found in England, those which have been examined for the
purpose have been free from these germs, and are therefore incapable of
propagating the disease.

DADDY-LONG-LEGS.

Large species, with variegated wings.]

In many parts of the world gnats are excessively numerous and troublesome
at certain seasons of the year, filling the air like clouds of dust, so
that it is difficult to sleep or eat from the annoyance and irritation
caused by their attacks. This will be readily credible to those who have
experienced the pain which they cause even when not very numerous, and have
been kept awake at night by their shrill piping as they approach. They
appear to be equally numerous in cold and warm countries--Lapland, France,
South Russia, Italy, various parts of America, and in fact most parts of
the world being liable to the inordinate multiplication of different
species.

In England they were formerly so abundant in the fenlands that
mosquito-curtains were in use less than a century ago, and may be so still.
But their numbers have so diminished of late years that, whenever gnats are
a little more troublesome than usual, it is reported that there has been an
invasion of mosquitoes. A year or two ago there was a report that
"mosquitoes" had been brought to Cromer in some fishing-vessel, and the
newspapers contained paragraphs about "mosquitoes" having caused much
annoyance in different parts of London. But many of the specimens submitted
to the inspection of entomologists proved to be nothing more than the
commonest of all the blood-sucking gnats, called the PIPING-GNAT by
Linnæus, on account of its shrill note. The note is produced by the rapid
vibration of the wings, which has been estimated at the rate of 3,000 per
minute. Gnats do not always fly near the ground. Sometimes they have been
seen ascending from cathedrals and other high buildings in such vast swarms
that they resembled clouds of smoke, and gave rise to the idea that the
building was actually on fire.

Equally troublesome and annoying are the SAND-FLIES, as they are called in
England, or the BLACK-FLIES, as they are called in America. They are very
small flies, short and broad, and with broader wings than gnats; and one of
them, which actually destroys many mules and other domestic animals in the
Mississippi Valley, as we learn from Professor Comstock, is called the
BUFFALO-GNAT, from a fancied resemblance of the side-view of the insect to
a buffalo. Other species are equally destructive to the cattle in the Banat
of Hungary. It is a curious circumstance that, in the case of nearly all
two-winged flies which attack men and animals, it is usually only the
females which suck blood, the males frequenting flowers and being perfectly
harmless.

HOVER-FLY.

[Illustration: RAT-TAILED LARVA.

Common in filthy water.]

Respecting mosquitoes in South America, Mr. H. W. Bates writes, in his work
"The Naturalist on the Amazons," when passing a night in a boat about
twenty-five miles from the town of Villa Nova: "At night it was quite
impossible to sleep for mosquitoes; they fell upon us by myriads, and
without much piping came straight at our faces as thick as rain-drops in a
shower. The men crowded into the cabins, and then tried to expel the pests
by the smoke from burnt rags; but it was of little avail, although we were
half suffocated during the operation." But the sand-flies, encountered a
little higher up the river, were much worse: "We made acquaintance on this
coast with a new insect-pest, the Piúm, a minute fly, two-thirds of a line
in length, which here commences its reign, and continues henceforward as a
terrible scourge along the upper river, or Solimoens, to the end of the
navigation on the Amazons. It comes forth only by day, relieving the
mosquito at sunrise with the greatest punctuality, and occurs only near the
muddy shores of the stream, not one ever being found in the shade of the
forest. In places where it is abundant, it accompanies canoes in such dense
swarms as to resemble thin clouds of smoke. It made its appearance in this
way the first day after we crossed the river. Before I was aware of the
presence of flies, I felt a slight itching on my neck, wrist, and ankles,
and, on looking for the cause, saw a number of tiny objects, having a
disgusting resemblance to lice, adhering to the skin. This was my first
introduction to the much-talked-of Piúm. On close examination, they are
seen to be small two-winged insects, with dark-coloured body and pale legs
and wings, the latter closed lengthwise over the back. They alight
imperceptibly, and, squatting close, fall at once to work, stretching
forward their tiny front legs, which are in constant motion, and seem to
act as feelers, and then applying their short, broad snouts to the skin.
Their abdomens soon become distended and red with blood, and then, their
thirst satisfied, they soon move off, sometimes so stupefied with their
potations that they can scarcely fly. No pain is felt whilst they are at
work, but they each leave a small circular raised spot on the skin, and a
disagreeable irritation. The latter may be avoided in great measure by
pressing out the blood which remains in the spot; but this is a troublesome
task when one has several hundred punctures in the course of a day [like
Prince Siror, in one of Bulwer Lytton's stories, who fell "pierced by five
hundred spears"]. I took the trouble to dissect specimens, to ascertain the
way in which the little pests operate. The mouth consists of a pair of
thick fleshy lips, and two triangular horny lancets, answering to the upper
lip and tongue of other insects. This is applied closely to the skin, a
puncture is made with the lancets, and the blood then sucked through
between these into the oesophagus, the circular spot which results
coinciding with the shape of the lips. In the course of a few days the red
spots dry up, and the skin in time becomes blackened with the endless
number of discoloured punctures that are crowded together. The irritation
they produce is more acutely felt by some persons than others. I once
travelled with a middle-aged Portuguese who was laid up for three weeks
from the attacks of Piúm, his legs being swelled to an enormous size, and
the punctures aggravated into spreading sores."

HOUSE-FLY (MALE AND FEMALE).

The larvæ of the house-fly live in refuse, so do not thrive where
cleanliness abounds.]

However, the traveller in Amazonia has one consolation: the great rivers
which traverse the forests are of three different colours; and the
black-water rivers--so called from the dark colour of the water, owing
apparently to the amount of vegetable matter which they hold in
solution--are never infested with mosquitoes. Probably the character of the
water renders it unsuitable to them for breeding purposes.

The CRANE-FLIES, or DADDY-LONG-LEGS, are also very injurious insects, but
in a different manner, for their subterranean maggots feed on and destroy
the roots of grass in the same way as the grubs of the Cockchafers. They
are insects of considerable size, with slender bodies, terminating in a
short, horny point (the ovipositor) in the female, and with long, slender
legs, which are liable to break off at the least touch. The commonest
species has a grey body and transparent wings; but there is a larger one
with the wings prettily variegated with brown, and a smaller one in which
there are yellow markings towards the end of the body.

The more typical FLIES have usually shorter and broader wings, and thicker,
shorter, and more hairy legs, than those just mentioned; and the antennæ
have usually only three or four joints, and are often furnished with a
long, slender bristle at or before the end of the last joint.

As in the case of the Gnats and Crane-Flies, so as regards the more typical
Flies, we have only space to notice a few of the more important families.

Some of the GAD-FLIES are no larger than house-flies, but others are as
large as wasps or larger, with broader wings, and of a black, grey, or
yellowish colour; they frequent fields, and settle on cattle, or on our
clothes or hands. Some have transparent and others dark-coloured wings, but
they are all capable of inflicting a severe puncture, often sufficient to
draw blood, even in the case of the smaller species.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S., Regent's Park._

BLUE-BOTTLE FLY, OR BLOW-FLY.

These flies deposit their eggs on meat, when it becomes "fly-blown."]

The prettiest of the gad-flies are the GOLDEN-EYED FLIES. They are black,
with the abdomen more or less marked with yellow; and black, or black and
transparent, wings. The eyes are of a beautiful golden green, dotted and
lined with purple. They are moderately stout insects, about the third of an
inch long, and are not uncommon. Another insect, known as the BLOOD-SUCKING
RAIN-FLY, has a rather long and slender body for a gad-fly, and is nearly
half an inch long. It is of a lighter or darker grey, with reddish markings
on the sides of the abdomen in the male. The wings are greyish brown with
whitish dots, and a white mark towards the tip. Both these flies are very
troublesome, the latter chiefly on the edges of woods or near water,
especially in rainy weather.

The ROBBER-FLIES are large flies, with long, tapering bodies, of a black or
partly yellow colour, and feed on smaller flies and other insects of
different kinds. They have very thick, hairy and a strong proboscis. A
handsome Australian species, allied to these, but with a broader body, is
represented in the Coloured Plate.

The HORNET ROBBER-FLY, represented on page 731, is one of the most
conspicuous of the British species. Among other places, it may be seen
flying over the short grass at the top of the cliffs between Brighton and
Rottingdean. They are very predaceous, and are probably rather beneficial
than otherwise, by contributing to keep down injurious insects. But in
North America there is a species called the BEE-KILLER, which is an
extremely destructive insect, taking up its station in front of a hive, and
killing large numbers of bees as they fly backwards and forwards from the
hive.

The HOVER-FLIES are brightly coloured, rather smooth flies, and are
familiar objects in gardens, and in open places in woods. They have the
habit of hovering motionless in the air, and then darting off suddenly.
Some of the larger species proceed from curious maggots, with long tails,
which have been compared to the tail of a rat. These live in putrid water;
and as the flies have a slight resemblance to bees, the fact is believed to
have given rise to the old fable that bees are generated from the rotting
carcases of oxen or other large animals.

The BOT-FLIES are remarkable for being parasitic on warm-blooded animals,
their maggots living in tumours on the skin of oxen, known as "warbles," or
in the stomach and intestines of horses, or in the nostrils and other
cavities in the heads of sheep or deer.

BLUE-BOTTLE FLY, OR BLOW-FLY.

This photograph shows the wings expanded.]

The HOUSE-FLIES and their allies form a very large group, divided into many
families. The true house-fly is an autumn insect; but there are other flies
which resemble it which live in houses at different times of the year. Most
of them are harmless, although there is one species, very like a house-fly,
which comes into houses in rainy weather, and inflicts a puncture like a
gad-fly. This is the meaning of the popular saying that "the flies bite in
rainy weather."

Although house-flies do not bite, yet they are sometimes exceedingly
troublesome when they are in unusual numbers; and as they settle
everywhere, they may convey infection mechanically, though not as the
principal agents in the dissemination of definite diseases, like the
mosquitoes. Thus, in Egypt, they are said frequently to convey ophthalmia,
a very prevalent disease in that country.

The very first paper published in the "Transactions of the present
Entomological Society of London" (for the existing Society had several
short-lived predecessors) was a paper read by William Spence at the meeting
on April 7, 1834, about a year after the Society had been definitely
founded, entitled "Observations on a Mode practised in Italy of excluding
the Common House-fly from Apartments." This desirable result is attained
simply by stretching a net of white or coloured thread, with meshes of an
inch or more in diameter, across an open window, which the flies will not
venture to pass, if the room is lighted from one side only--"for if there
be a _thorough_ light either from an opposite or side window, the flies
pass through the net without scruple." Mr. Spence's son also referred to a
passage in Herodotus where he says that Egyptian fishermen in his time
defended themselves from the gnats by covering their beds with the nets
which they had used in the day for fishing, and through which these
insects, though they bit through linen or woollen, did not even attempt to
bite. The matter seems to have been overlooked in recent years, though it
is evidently well worthy of consideration when flies or gnats are
troublesome.

There is a conspicuous insect allied to the house-flies, but a little
larger, measuring about half an inch in length. It is called the NOON-DAY
FLY, and is often seen in considerable numbers, in the hottest part of the
day, flying round and settling on the trunks and leaves of trees; it also
settles on cow-dung. It is a shining black fly, with the sides and under
surface of the head golden yellow in the male; the wings are transparent,
slightly tinged with pale brown, and bright rusty yellow towards the base.

The African TSETSE-FLY is not very unlike a house-fly, and is one of the
worst pests to cattle in those parts of Africa which it infests; for any
horse, ox, or dog attacked by it will infallibly die after a longer or
shorter period of suffering, though wild animals and sucking calves are not
affected by it. It used to be supposed that the fly itself infused some
deadly venom with its puncture; but later experiments have led naturalists
to the conclusion that the fly is not itself poisonous, but that it forms
the channel of communication of some fatal disease, just as some species of
mosquitoes convey the infection of malaria.

Destructive to horses and cattle in Africa.]

The BLOW-FLIES, or BLUE-BOTTLES, of which there are several species closely
allied to each other, are common in houses; and a smaller brilliant green
fly, called the GREEN-BOTTLE FLY, is common on hedges. These are all flies
which lay their eggs on fresh or putrid meat, when it is said to be
"fly-blown." They will also lay their eggs in open sores; and in former
days the sufferings of the wounded after a battle were often frightfully
aggravated by this cause; and at the present day farmers would frequently
lose sheep through their attacks, if they were not carefully tended in hot
weather.

Various species of flies in Eastern Europe, the Southern States of America,
Jamaica, etc., habitually lay their eggs in the mouths or nostrils of men
and animals, and the resulting maggots cause dreadful suffering and often
death. In India, and especially in the Eastern Archipelago, there are some
brilliantly coloured, smooth, metallic blue and green flies as big as
bumble-bees. There is also a family of flies allied to the house-fly, which
have very bristly bodies, and are parasitic on caterpillars, like
ichneumon-flies.

TSETSE-FLY (ENLARGED).

Showing the proboscis and veining of the wings more distinctly.]

There are other flies which easily attract attention, such as the yellow
hairy fly found about cow-dung, and some rather small species with prettily
variegated wings, which feed on flowers or fruit. The cheese-hoppers are
also the maggots of a small black fly.

Besides these, there are some aberrant parasitic families of flies with
long, hairy legs, and only one or two joints to the antennæ. These are the
FOREST-FLIES and BIRD-FLIES, which attack horses and birds; and also some
wingless insects, such as the so-called SHEEP-TICK (easily distinguished
from a true tick by possessing only six legs), the BEE-PARASITES, and the
spider-like BAT-PARASITES. This parasitic group is also remarkable for
depositing full-grown larvæ or pupæ instead of eggs.

The FLEAS are a small group of small wingless insects, with such powers of
leaping that it has been said that if a man was as agile as a flea he could
jump over the dome of St. Paul's. The larvæ of fleas are small, worm-like
creatures, with bristles, but without legs; they probably live on any sort
of animal or vegetable refuse. They subsequently change to pupæ in small
cocoons, and emerge as perfect fleas, which live by sucking the blood of
warm-blooded animals; or, when that fails them, they may attack
caterpillars, or other small soft-bodied creatures. Though not very
particular about their food, different species are more or less attached to
different animals; and while in Europe the most troublesome species is the
one considered to be most particularly attached to man, the species most
troublesome in North America is known in Europe as the DOG-FLEA. They are
all very similar in habits and appearance. Fleas are not only annoying,
but, in conjunction with rats, are believed to be among the principal
agents in the spread of the plague. There is another insect called the
JIGGER, or SAND-FLEA, common in most of the warmer parts of America, and
which has more recently been introduced into Africa. The female burrows
into the feet of men or animals, where her body swells up with eggs to the
size of a pea; and serious and sometimes fatal ulcers are the ordinary
result, unless the insect is carefully extracted at an early stage of the
attack.

USES OF FLIES.

It must not be supposed from the foregoing observations that flies are
simply and solely pests to man and beast, without any redeeming qualities.
Their services are less required in cold and settled countries, but in warm
climates their value as scavengers can hardly be over-estimated. As regards
the removal of carrion alone, Linnæus declared that the progeny of only
three blow-flies would devour the carcase of a dead horse as quickly as a
lion--a statement which, even if slightly exaggerated, conveys a vivid idea
of their voracity and the rate at which they increase.

Flies are also useful in keeping down the multitudes of destructive
insects. Numbers of caterpillars fall victims to the bristly flies alluded
to on the last page; and the Bee-flies, which form a family placed next to
the Gad-flies, render far greater service in destroying locusts. They much
resemble small bumble-bees, being very much the same shape, and they are
clothed with yellow down in the British species, and the transparent wings
are conspicuously marked with black bands (as in the photograph above), or
with brown shading and spots. The insects have a very rapid flight, and use
their long proboscis to suck the honey of flowers; but their grubs are
parasitic--at least in some instances--on wild bees; and it is probable
that their resemblance to bees has some reference to this mode of life. But
in Cyprus, Algeria, North America, etc., the larvæ of allied species feed
inside the egg-cases of locusts, sometimes destroying as large a proportion
as four-fifths of the whole brood. Locusts have many enemies, but it will
easily be seen that the attacks of foes like these must reduce their
numbers considerably, notwithstanding the swarms which frequently survive,
and which are liable to the attacks of other enemies, such as robber-flies,
locust-birds, etc., after they have actually arrived at maturity.

Nor must we omit to notice the use of flies as articles of food for man or
useful animals. Many persons are very fond of cheese-hoppers, which are
really the maggots of a small fly; and we read in Kirby's "Textbook of
Entomology," page 92: "The Rev. A. E. Eaton informs me that he believes
that two species of _Ephemeridæ_ (May-flies) form a portion of the
so-called 'Kungu Cake,' manufactured by the natives of South Africa of
gnats, and probably any other insects which can be obtained in sufficient
abundance." "Gentles," which are the maggots of flies, are used by anglers
for ground-bait.

CHAPTER I.

_SHELL-FISH, OR MOLLUSCS._


The Molluscan Group or Sub-kingdom represents one, if not the most
important, of the invertebrate sections of living animals with relation
both to its numbers and variety and in its commercial and economic utility
to mankind. In its ranks are included all those animals generally known as
Shell-fish, and familiar to the non-scientific in the shape of Oysters,
Mussels, Whelks, Periwinkles, and the innumerable varieties of gorgeous or
delicately tinted shells of tropical seas.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

AN OCTOPUS CROUCHING IN A ROCK-POOL.

Green shore-crabs constitute the chief food of the octopus.]

Collectively, Molluscs differ from all such invertebrate groups as Insects,
Crustaceans, and Worms in that they possess neither jointed limbs nor
jointed bodies, their body-substance being enclosed by a more or less
distinct muscular sac, or integument, technically known as the "mantle."
Molluscs possess no internal skeleton; but for the protection of their soft
and otherwise defenceless bodies the mantle is among the great majority of
species endowed with the property of secreting a more or less indurated
calcareous shell, within which, when danger threatens, the creature can
entirely withdraw. In some species the shell secreted is relatively small,
and serves only as a protective shield to especially vital areas; while in
a third very considerable assemblage a shell is altogether absent. The
minute yet technically recognisable structural differences between the
shells of even the most closely allied specific forms, and the wider and
distinctly evident divergences that separate the more remotely connected
varieties, furnish the basis for their classification and nomenclature by
the systematic conchologist. Molluscan shells, being so extensively
preserved in the fossil state, furnish the geologist with invaluable data
for his determination of the age and respective relationship of the
fossil-bearing strata of the earth's crust.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S., Milford-on-Sea._

AN OCTOPUS ON ITS BACK AT BAY, LEFT HIGH AND DRY BY THE RETREATING TIDE.

In this attitude the octopus can use its many-suckered tentacles and its
formidable parrot-like beak as defensive weapons.]

Having no jointed limbs, molluscs are dependent upon some other mechanical
adaptation for their powers of locomotion. This, in the majority of
species, is represented by a modification of the lower surface of the
animal's body, which is so richly supplied with muscular tissues as to
constitute an effective creeping-base. As a locomotive organ this muscular
area is usually known as the "foot."

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

OCTOPODS.

A blue-spotted West Australian species.]

Of living molluscs some 50,000 distinct species have been recorded. The
great majority of these organisms are, as is well known, marine. A very
considerable number, however, are inhabitants of fresh-water; while a yet
smaller proportion, like the Slugs and Snails and their allies, are
especially adapted for a terrestrial existence. Excepting two relatively
small and inconspicuous groups, the great natural division or sub-kingdom
of Molluscs is separated by systematic zoologists into three main sections
or classes. The particular modification of the locomotive organ, or foot,
serves, on the one hand, to readily distinguish the first or most highly
organised group from the second or central class; while the third or lowest
one is as clearly separated from the second and first by the character of
the shell. The first and most highly developed section includes such
species as the Octopus, the Cuttle-fish, the Squid, and the several
varieties of Nautiluses; to the second or central group are referred all
the marine and terrestrial Slugs and Snails with their innumerable
modifications; while the third and lowest group comprises all the
double-shelled or bivalve forms, such as Oysters and Mussels.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

A TASMANIAN SQUID, OR CUTTLE-FISH.

Giant species of squids have been recorded in which the shorter tentacles
measured 12 feet, and the two longer ones as much as 30 or 40 feet in
length.]

In the OCTOPUS and its allies the creeping-base, or foot, is prolonged
round its margin into eight or more arm-like extensions. The anterior of
these in the earlier phases of their development grow round and enclose the
mouth, which consequently opens upon the centre of the locomotive surface.
The arms of the octopus and other forms are in most instances provided
throughout their length with complex sucking-disks, wherewith their owners
can seize and retain their prey or walk with ease and celerity over the
smoothest perpendicular or overhanging rock-surfaces. The octopus, as the
type of its class, possesses yet another most effective locomotive organ.
This is the so-called funnel, or siphuncle, a membranous tube connected
with the capacious gill-cavity which is formed by a folding of the mantle
on the under-surface. When at rest or moving leisurely, the water taken in
through the pocket-like entrance to this cavity is discharged through the
funnel without any particular effort. The animal can, however, at will
leave go its attachment to the rocks, and propel itself swiftly through
water by successive forcible expulsions of the water through the funnel. By
directing the aperture of the funnel to the right or left, the creature can
also direct its course in whatever direction it desires. When thus
swimming, its translation is necessarily backwards. Another notable feature
of the octopus is the "ink-bag," a huge gland secreting an inky-black
fluid, which, as produced by the common cuttle-fish, constitutes the sepia
of commerce. The contents of the ink-bag are discharged through the funnel
at the will of the animal; as soon as the ink is brought into contact with
the water, it becomes distributed through it in the form of a thick cloud,
under cover of which the mollusc makes good its escape from any attacking
enemy.

The octopus in British seas by no means attains to its maximum growth.
Examples with arms from 2 to 2½ feet in length are accounted large
specimens. In Mediterranean waters, however, these dimensions are much
exceeded, individuals with arms 5 feet long, which are capable of covering
a circular area no less than 10 feet in diameter with their fully extended
appendages, being frequently recorded. In the West Indies, on the
North-west American coast, and also in Chinese seas, similar, if not larger
dimensions are attained by these creatures. That these monster octopods, or
"devil-fish," as they are sometimes designated, prove a source of danger to
human life has been abundantly demonstrated. Lurking, as is their custom,
among rock-crevices, they seize hold of any moving object which approaches
within reach of their extended arms. Bathers in this manner have been
seized and drowned, it being impossible for even the strongest swimmer to
free himself from the clutches of one of these animals, which, while
retaining a firm hold on the rocks with a portion of its hundred-suckered
arms, has entwined the others around its victim.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SHELL OF THE PEARLY NAUTILUS.

The inner lining of this shell is brilliantly iridescent.]

The natural food of the octopus are crabs, lobsters, and their like; and in
places like the Channel Islands, where the tide retires very low, leaving
the rock-fissures inhabited by the molluscs more or less exposed, their
presence may be often foretold by the accumulation of empty, broken-up
crab-shells around the entrances to their retreats. In common with other
members of its tribe, the octopus is furnished with a strong, horny,
parrot-like beak, wherewith it can with ease break through the shells of
its accustomed food. The year 1900 was remarkable for the extraordinary
abundance of the octopus on the English south coast, the result of their
collective depredations very seriously affecting the local crab and lobster
fisheries. The pots laid down over-night, in place of yielding the
following morning their customary quota of marketable crustaceans, were
more often than otherwise found to contain nothing but broken-up shells and
a loathsome "devil-fish."

The SQUIDS and CUTTLE-FISHES, with their large lustrous eyes, are
especially adapted for an open sea life, and for this purpose are furnished
with lateral fin-like membranous expansions. A more important structural
distinction is their possession of two supplementary appendages, which,
usually retracted within special pouches when not in use, can be shot out
to a length at least twice that of the eight ordinary arms. Both the
cuttle-fish and the squid, or calamary, are also the possessors of an
internal calcareous or horny shell which underlies and strengthens the
upper-surface. The cuttle-bone used as a dentifrice and ink-eraser is the
product of the first-named mollusc. The Ten-armed group, as it is named,
with reference to the two supplementary arms, ten in all, possessed by its
members, is notable for including species whose dimensions not only exceed
those of any other invertebrate type, but whose fully extended length
rivals that of the largest vertebrates. Giant squids, or calamaries, have
been taken off the coast of Newfoundland, yielding, with their tentacular
arms extended, a linear measurement of over 50 feet, associated with an
estimated weight of as much as 1,000 lbs. There can be no doubt that these
giant squids have in many instances furnished the basis of the
oft-recurrent sea-serpent stories, more especially on those occasions where
the supposed marine reptile and a whale have been reported as seen engaged
in combat. As a matter of fact the sperm-whales habitually feed on deep-sea
squids, and have been known, when mortally wounded, to vomit forth detached
portions of these gigantic molluscs. The long tentacular arms of one of
these monsters, thrown around the whale with which it had entered upon a
death-struggle, might at a little distance be easily mistaken for some huge
snake-like organism.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SHELL OF THE ARGONAUT, OR PAPER-NAUTILUS.

The female animal only possesses a shell, and uses it as a cradle for her
eggs and young.]

The various species of NAUTILUS, including the so-called "Paper" and
"Pearly" species, belong likewise to this group of Molluscs. In the former
case, however, it is only the female animal which secretes a shell, and
this is used as a cradle wherein she deposits her eggs and rears her young.
The pretty romance of the PAPER-NAUTILUS, or ARGONAUT, as it is technically
termed, floating on the sun-lit waves with spreading sails and an even
keel, has unfortunately been entirely dissipated by the penetrating
search-light of modern science. The animal only floats on the surface when
ill, or when torn from its customary pasture-fields by abnormal storms,
otherwise it creeps about the sea-bottom, or disports itself in the
sub-marine grottoes like an ordinary octopus, with which, in point of fact,
the shell-less male agrees in all essential details. The shell-cradle of
the paper-nautilus is not vitally connected with the body of the animal, as
is that of the pearly species and all ordinary shell-fish. It is freely
detachable from the body, and during life is grasped and held closely to it
by the expanded extremities of the two lateral tentacles by which the
delicate shell is mainly secreted.

The next group comprises the great bulk of Simple-shelled Molluscs, of
which it is impossible in these pages to give more than a brief enumeration
of some of the most prominent. The Lung-breathing section, which is usually
awarded the first place on the list, includes the familiar GARDEN-SNAILS,
the SHELL-LESS SLUGS, the FRESH-WATER SNAILS which come to the surface to
breathe, and many distinct terrestrial species. The largest living
representative of this group is the huge Land-snail of tropical West
Africa, sometimes known as the AGATE-SNAIL, the shell of which is not
infrequently as much as 7½ inches long.

[Illustration: GIANT CLAM-SHELLS ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, AS EXPOSED AT
EXTREME LOW TIDE.

The shell in the foreground is 4 feet in diameter.]

The NAKED-GILLED SEA-SLUGS constitute a second clearly defined group. All
the species are essentially marine, and most abundant among seaweeds and
coral-growths, over twenty species occurring in British seas. They are
notable for the slug-like form of their body, which is usually supplemented
by the outgrowth from it of complex, variously modified gill-filaments. In
some species these external gills take the form of symmetrical flower-like
tufts at the posterior end of the back, while in others simple or variously
branched gills may be developed on the upper-surface. The colours of many
of these sea-slugs are more brilliant than those of any other molluscs,
this being especially the case with the tropical coral-reef-frequenting
species. Bright scarlet, yellows, and blues, separately or variously
combined, are among the dominant tints. Many of these tropical species are
also of considerable size. One particular kind, having a flower-like dorsal
gill-tuft, observed by the writer on the West Australian reefs, was over 10
inches long and 8 inches broad. Its general ground-colour was intense
vermilion, relieved, however, by a frilled border nearly an inch in width
of the purest white, with radiating streaks of scarlet. It is an
interesting circumstance that these naked-gilled molluscs, shell-less so
far as their adult phases are concerned, emerge from the egg with a
perfectly formed, but necessarily very minute, transparent shell,
resembling that of a garden-snail. It is consequently inferred that the
group has been derived from some permanently shell-bearing form.

HIGHLY MAGNIFIED TONGUE OF A SEA-SNAIL.

With this structure its owner bores or files a hole through the shells of
other molluscs upon which it preys.]

The Comb-gilled section embraces the great majority of the marine molluscs
having a single more or less convoluted or spirally twisted shell. They
take their name from the circumstance that the gills have a compactly
disposed comb-like contour. This gill-tuft is situated in an excavated
chamber inside the shell, immediately over the neck. The COMMON WHELK, the
PELICAN'S-FOOT SHELL, and the WINKLE are a few typical British marine
representatives of this group, which, however, attains to the zenith of its
development in the size, variety of form, and ornate coloration of its
shells in tropical seas. The inter-tropical coral-reefs in particular yield
a most abundant harvest in this direction. The shells in common use
obtained from such a source include the ponderous HELMET-SHELLS, or CONCHS,
employed for the manufacture of cameos; the GIANT WHELKS and
TRUMPET-SHELLS, often over 18 inches long, used as signal-horns throughout
Polynesia and on the tropical Australian coast; and the capacious
MELON-SHELLS, made to do duty for boat-baling and as water-vessels and
general domestic receptacles throughout the same tropical area. To this
list may be added the HARP-SHELLS, VOLUTES, CONES, MITRES, OLIVES, THORNY
WOODCOCKS, and a host of others prized by the conchologist. To this section
must also be referred the innumerable species of COWRIES, of which the
large, boldly mottled "TIGER" and "PANTHER" species are well known. The
comparatively small, yellowish, thickly built, porcelain-like shell of the
"MONEY-COWRIE" constitutes, as is well known, the current coin throughout
extensive areas of Africa and India. It is recorded that as large a
quantity as sixty tons of these small shells, originally collected from
tropical seas, have been shipped from one British port alone to the African
coast for commercial use within a single year. One very diminutive cowrie,
pale pink in colour, with a delicately streaked surface, is indigenous to
British waters.

The third large group of Molluscs which demands attention is that of the
Bivalves, or Leaf-gilled group. Though not so numerous in species as the
last, it outrivals it in the enormous abundance in which the individuals of
many varieties are produced. OYSTERS, MUSSELS, COCKLES, SCALLOPS, and other
allied forms occur in closely associated colonies, constituting natural
"beds" or "banks," which may be of vast extent and, in at any rate the case
of oysters, several feet in thickness. From a commercial and economic
standpoint this group is undoubtedly of the highest importance to the human
race. Not only do its members, as instanced by the foregoing forms,
contribute largely to the world's commissariat, they also yield the
much-prized material known as "mother-of-pearl" and the purest and most
æsthetically beautiful gems--orient pearls. Pearls and mother-of-pearl are
the products of two groups of shell-fish, respectively known as
PEARL-OYSTERS and PEARL-MUSSELS. There are a considerable number of
species, mainly denizens of tropical seas, which, like ordinary oysters and
mussels, occur naturally in banks and beds of vast extent. In some species,
such as the CEYLON PEARL-OYSTER, the shell is small, and the
mother-of-pearl substance, or "nacre," as it is technically termed, so thin
as to be of relatively little value. Hence the fishery for this species is
conducted almost exclusively for the sake of the pearls, which are fairly
numerous and frequently of the finest quality. From the tropical Australian
seas pearl-shells of the largest size, which produce the thickest and most
valuable mother-of-pearl, are obtained. Pearls of the best quality are more
rarely found in this description of shell, and its fishery is prosecuted
primarily on account of the substantial substance and magnificent quality
of its nacre. A single pair of shells of this species will attain in its
adult state to a weight of from 12 to 18 lbs. The fishery for this
pearl-shell has, however, been prosecuted so relentlessly that bivalves of
such matured age and weight are now of rare occurrence, and obtained only
from almost inaccessibly deep waters. Unless, in point of fact, systematic
methods of conservation and cultivation are resorted to on an extensive
scale and on lines corresponding fundamentally with those successfully
followed in the culture of ordinary commercial oysters, there would seem to
be an imminent risk of the valuable Australian pearl-shell fisheries
becoming depleted to more or less complete exhaustion.

ROCK-OYSTERS.

This is the ordinary commercial oyster of the Australian shores.]

The tropical Australian seas, and notably those which wash the Great
Barrier Reef, are famous for the production of the largest of living
bivalve molluscs. These are represented by the GIANT CLAMS, which, dwelling
among the coral-growths, are left exposed to view for brief periods during
abnormally low spring tides. A photograph of a colony of these monster
bivalves, taken by the writer amidst this mollusc's characteristic
surroundings, is reproduced on page 741. The example in the foreground
measured no less than 4 feet in diameter and weighed several
hundred-weights. In many clams the living tissues, or mantle-borders, that
are exposed to view when the shell-valves are partly open, are brilliantly
tinted.

A QUEENSLAND OYSTER-BANK.

Illustrating another characteristic growth-phase of the Australian
rock-oyster.]

Of the SCALLOPS many of the larger species are highly esteemed for the
table. It is notable of them that they can progress through the water in a
jerky, flight-like manner by the repeated flapping of their opposing
shells. In many scallops the jewel-like eyes are developed in a row round
the margin of the mantle.

The Bivalve Class includes certain representatives which are held in evil
repute, on account of their destructive habits. PHOLAS and its allies bore
their way into solid rock, bringing about its complete disintegration. From
the dreaded SHIP-WORM, or TEREDO, on the other hand, there would appear to
be no description of wood that can withstand its ravages.

The Bivalve Molluscs are not without fresh-water representatives. The
well-known POND- and RIVER-MUSSELS, which form the most conspicuous
examples of this group, number several hundred species. While insipid and
of no account for the human commissariat, many of its members produce
pearls of value. One such, obtained from the river Conway, in North Wales,
is said to occupy a place in the crown of England.

The CHITONS, or MULTIVALVE MOLLUSCS, invite brief notice. As the last-named
title implies, the shell-elements in this group are relatively numerous,
consisting of eight pieces, or plates, which may form contiguous transverse
shelly shields that entirely cover in and protect the dorsal surface of the
elongate, boat-shaped body, or may be more or less isolated from one
another. In the former instance the animal bears some considerable
resemblance to a gigantic limbless wood-louse, and, like that familiar
terrestrial crustacean, it is capable of rolling itself into a spheroidal
shape as a means of protection. None of the chitons are provided with eyes
in the adult state in that region of their body--namely, the head--where
they might be most naturally expected to exist. Recent scientific
investigation has, however, elicited the fact that in various species the
respective shell-plates are studded with minute eye-specks, the aggregate
number of visual organs thus possessed by certain forms reaching to the
astonishing figures of 11,000 or 12,000. The majority of the chitons are
shallow-water, rock-frequenting molluscs, which may be successfully sought
by turning over stones at low water. Several species are inhabitants of
British seas.

CHAPTER II.

_LAMP-SHELLS._


A little group of double-shelled creatures, formerly regarded as near
allies of the Oysters and Mussels, are the LAMP-SHELLS. Their scientific
appellation, signifying "arm footed," relates to the two spirally
convoluted arm-like structures which constitute the salient features in
these animals. That of lamp-shells bears reference to the small circular
perforation near the extremity, or "beak," of the united shells, which
imparts to the entire structure a not altogether remote resemblance to an
ancient Greek or Roman lamp with its sub-terminal wick-hole. In all
essential points of their organisation the lamp-shells differ so
essentially from ordinary bivalves that they are now generally recognised
as representing an independent animal class, having, as a matter of fact, a
closer relationship with Worms than with Molluscs. In their earlier
condition certain lamp-shells are indistinguishable from larval worms;
while the convoluted arms of the adult animals, thickly beset with bristles
and hairs, closely resemble the arms, or "cirrhi," of many sea-worms. The
superadded valves of the lamp-shells differ fundamentally from those of the
bivalve molluscs in the circumstance that they are developed upon the upper
and lower surfaces respectively of the enclosed animal, and not on the
sides. The union between the two valves is also accomplished through the
medium of interlocking calcareous teeth, in place of a horny or ligamentous
hinge-joint, as obtains in an oyster or a mussel. A supplementary
calcareous support, having a corresponding spiral shape, is also developed
in connection with the convoluted arms. This structure varies in the
contour of its minuter details in every specific form, which thus furnishes
zoologists with a basis for systematic classification. The lamp-shells
collectively form two natural groups or orders. In one of these the shells
are hinged together, and are of conspicuously unequal dimensions. The
larger shell of the two is more distinctly concave and produced into a
perforated beak. It is this structure that in some species resembles the
wick-hole of an antique lamp, and has given rise to the popular title by
which these shells are distinguished. The second or hingeless group is
further distinguished by the shells being of almost uniform shape and size.
In the most interesting example of this group, known as LINGULA, the two
shells are thin, horny, of a green tint, and mounted on a long, flexible,
worm-like stalk. Like a worm, this creature moves about in the mud, and
constructs a sand-lined dwelling-tube.

Although lamp-shells are represented by comparatively few species at the
present day, in the older epochs they existed in enormous abundance. It is
further remarkable of this group that many species are scarcely
distinguishable from their fossil ancestors. Lingula, the type last
referred to, is especially notable in this respect.

CHAPTER III.

_STAR-FISHES, SEA-URCHINS, ETC._


The somewhat varied assemblage of marine animals familiarly known as
STAR-FISHES, FEATHER-STARS, BRITTLE-STARS, SEA-URCHINS, and SEA-CUCUMBERS
all agree structurally with one another and differ from all other living
organisms in several conspicuous features. Prominent among these is the
circumstance that their protecting skin is more or less extensively
impregnated externally and strengthened internally with calcareous elements
which take the form of plates and spines and spicules.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

COMMON OR SHORT-SPINED SEA-URCHIN.

This species is used for food in Italy and other Continental countries.]

The COMMON SEA-URCHIN may be cited as an example in which these calcareous
elements attain their maximum development. The subspherical box-like case
or shell, wherein all the vital organs are enclosed and safely protected,
is a common object of the seashore, and, empty and denuded of its external
coating of prickly spines, familiarly known as a "sea-egg." Examined
closely, this shell is found to consist of a series of calcareous plates,
which dovetail or fit together in juxtaposition with the utmost nicety. The
surface of the shell is studded throughout with rounded hemispherical
knobs, those of a larger size having a very distinctly symmetrical plan of
distribution. These rounded knobs are the bases of attachment of the
spines, which radiate at all points from the surface of the shell when the
animal is alive. It will be further recognised on a nearer examination that
the walls of the shell are pierced on a definitely symmetrical pattern with
minute perforations, such perforations being most distinctly visible on the
inner surface of the shell. These minute punctures are the apertures
through which in life the delicate tubular locomotive organs, or so-called
"feet," are thrust out and retracted. The majority of these tubular organs
terminate in a circular sucking-disk, wherewith, collectively, the urchin
is able to adhere to and travel over the surface of the smoothest rock, or
even up the glass walls of an aquarium. In the empty beach-gathered
urchin-shell a circular hole may be observed at the two opposite poles, the
one in the centre of the lower and flatter surface being the larger of the
two. It is within this lower and larger one that the mouth, with its
complex apparatus of teeth, is suspended. The membranous disk which covers
the upper and smaller circular aperture in the living animal is perforated
centrally by the vent, and around it are grouped the eye-spots and sundry
excretory apertures.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

LONG-SPINED SEA-URCHINS.

The needle-like spines of these sea-urchins are over a foot in length.
Acres of these creatures may be sometimes seen on tidally exposed areas of
the Queensland Great Barrier Reef, where this photograph was taken.]

A noteworthy feature associated with the greater portion of the structural
details of the sea-urchin which have been enumerated is the dominance of
the number five in the constituent elements. It is found, for instance,
that the perforated areas through which the tube-feet are protruded form,
as with the petals and other elements of many flowers, five symmetrically
corresponding segments. The dental apparatus comprises five equivalent
tooth-like structures, and there are five eye-spots and five excretory
apertures at the upper pole. This particular number, with multiples of the
same, is furthermore characteristic of all the typical members of the
class. Thus, in the COMMON STAR-FISH, there are five so-called arms, five
eye-spots, one at the tip of each arm, and five equivalent elemental
components of all the more important viscera. In the SEA-CUCUMBERS, which
have elongate worm-like bodies, there is a similar apportionment of the
nerves and muscles of the body generally into fives, and also of the
branching tentacles which surround the mouth. Tubular locomotive organs,
the so-called "tube-feet," are common to all the three types enumerated.
The calcareous plates and spinules, while attaining to a maximum
development in the urchins, are also abundantly represented in the other
groups. In the common star-fish these calcareous elements form within the
skin an openly reticulated trellis-like framework, while in the ordinary
sea-cucumbers they more usually take the form of innumerable
microscopically minute spicules. The two less familiarly known groups of
the FEATHER-STARS and BRITTLE-STARS fully agree with the previously
enumerated types in their five-fold structural composition. The
brittle-stars have almost invariably five arms only, but they are
independent outgrowths from the body proper, instead of being prolongations
of it, as in the common star-fish.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

THICK-SPINED SEA-URCHIN.

In large specimens the spines are as thick as a slate-pencil, and may be
used for the same purpose.]

The FEATHER-STARS, which include some of the rarest and most beautiful
representatives of the group, are mostly inhabitants of deep water, and
remarkable for the circumstance that either throughout life or in their
early phases they are affixed to submarine objects by slender stalks. This
peculiarity imparts to the animals such a flower-like aspect that, in
conjunction with the indurated calcareous nature of their skeletons, they
have received the title of "Stone-lilies." This appellation, however, was
originally more particularly applied to their fossilised remains, which
occur in remarkable abundance in the older geological strata.

The most familiar British representative of the group is the ROSY
FEATHER-STAR, occasionally obtained among seaweed in rock-pools on the
southern coast, but more often brought up with the dredge from deeper
water. In this form the elongate feather-like arms radiate from the
central, relatively small, five-rayed body. There is no supporting
foot-stalk in this adult stage, the animal being freely movable, and
clinging to seaweeds and other objects by means of a cluster of claw-like
filaments developed upon its under-surface. Releasing its hold upon its
temporarily selected position, it can crawl about with the aid of the
hooked extremities of its arms and their radiating joints. It can also
propel itself through the water in a somewhat clumsy fashion by the
consecutive flexion and extension of these appendages. This freedom of
locomotion was not, however, always possessed by the feather-star. In its
early days, and when of very small size, it was affixed to a slender
foot-stalk, and dependent for its food on the animalcules and other minute
organisms which drifted or swam within reach of its extended arms. The rosy
feather-star takes its name from the bright rose-red tints by which it is
usually characterised. Individuals of the species are, however, subject to
considerable colour-variation. On the Australian coast, where many forms
are abundantly represented, examples tinted deep crimson, black, bright
golden yellow, or sundry admixtures of these several hues are not
uncommonly found associated among a dredge-haul of these elegant sea-stars.

The PERMANENTLY STALKED STONE-LILIES are at the present day of rare
occurrence. Up to within comparatively recent years the so-called
MEDUSA'S-HEAD LILY was, indeed, regarded as the only living representative
of the group. This species has a pentagonal jointed foot-stalk that may be
3 feet long, with five slender appendages developed in whorls at short
sub-equal distances throughout its length. From the shallow cup-shaped body
at the apex of the stalk a tassel-like bundle of arms is developed, all of
these being produced by repeated bifurcation from one of the five
equivalent basal stem-joints. Dredging expeditions have within the last
quarter of a century revealed the existence of a considerable number of
previously unknown species of stone-lilies in the abysses of the ocean, a
depth of no less than 3,200 fathoms representing the habitat of one such
type.

[Illustration: _Photo by N. Lazarnick_]     [_New York._

STAR-FISH IN WATER.

If pulled to pieces, each of the five arms, or fingers, will grow into a
perfect star-fish.]

The Star-fish group is represented by the COMMON FIVE-FINGERS, or
CROSS-FISH, as it is sometimes called, and includes a very numerous
assemblage of species of varying size and shape and colour. The British
seas alone yield some twenty forms. Among the more notable of these is the
SUN STAR-FISH, which, departing from the rule of possessing five arms only,
has twelve or more, its contour, from which it derives its name, somewhat
resembling that of a symbolic sun. The colours of this species are
particularly brilliant, consisting usually of a variably patterned
admixture of crimson, pink, and white. An extreme contrast in contour to
the sun-star is presented by the so-called BIRD'S-FOOT species, in which
the body is pentagonal and so flattened out as to somewhat resemble the
foot of a duck. In the Cushion-stars the body, while pentagonal, is
comparatively thick.

[Illustration: _Photo by E. Connold._]     [_St. Leonards._

STAR-FISH, OUT OF WATER, TURNING OVER.

The sucker-tipped tubes with which the star-fish effects locomotion are
well shown in this photograph.]

The so-called SNAKE-ARMED SAND-STARS and BRITTLE-STARS constitute a section
distinguished from the preceding by the character of the arms, which branch
separately from the central body, and are composed of an innumerable series
of calcareous joints, which snap asunder under the slightest provocation.
The great majority of the species are provided with five simple arms only.
In an exceptional form, however, known as the SHETLAND ARGUS, and its
allies, these five arms, while simple at their base, bifurcate repeatedly
and in geometrical progression to such an extent as to form in life a
complex network of writhing, snake-like tendrils, that has been
appropriately likened to a Medusa's head. It has been calculated that there
are no less than 80,000 terminal arm-subdivisions in adult examples of this
species.

Among the Sea-urchin Tribe there are many notable departures from the
typical form previously referred to. In some, while the sub-spheroidal form
of the case, or test, is still retained, the external spiny armature is
greatly varied. In one series these spines are exceedingly long, slender,
and of needle-like contour and sharpness. In others, while long, they are
abnormally thick and cylindrical, somewhat resembling slate-pencils, for
which they are sometimes used as a substitute; or they may be club-shaped,
branched, or reduced to flattened plates. In other forms the shell itself
is conspicuously modified. With some known as BISCUIT- or CAKE-URCHINS it
is flattened out to the resemblance of a cake or biscuit, the spines being
minute and inconspicuous. In another group, distinguished as HEART-URCHINS,
the shell is oval and bilaterally symmetrical, though the dominant number
of five still holds good with regard to the building up of its structural
details. One of the most interesting is the LEATHER-URCHIN, so called on
account of the flexible and loosely jointed character of its shell, the way
being paved by such a form to the normally soft- and flexible-skinned
sea-cucumbers. Sea-urchins are to a great extent vegetable-feeders, and the
larger species are appreciated as an article of food in many countries, the
ovaries, or roe, with which at certain periods the shell is mostly filled,
forming the edible portion.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

A YOUNG BRITTLE STAR-FISH (MUCH MAGNIFIED).

The arms of the brittle-stars are composed of loosely fitting, readily
fractured joints.]

The SEA-CUCUMBERS--better known in the commercial world as Bêche-de-mer, or
Trepang--represent the only group which possesses a substantial
market-value. Its typical members present an elongate worm-like contour,
but progress by means of extensile tube-feet, after the manner of the
Urchins and Star-fishes, and have their dental, nervous, and muscular
systems fashioned on the same five-sectioned basis. The mouth, which is
situated at one extremity of the body, is surrounded by a series of ten or
twenty delicately branched or mop-like tentacles, which can be protruded or
retracted at the animal's will, and are used for seizing food. The skin of
the typical sea-cucumber is more or less soft and flexible, and has
embedded within its substance innumerable minute calcareous spinules.

The commercially valuable sea-cucumbers, or bêche-de-mer, are all
inhabitants of tropical waters, the North-eastern Australian coast and the
Malay seas yielding the most highly prized forms. The Queensland Great
Barrier Reef, consisting of a series of coral-reefs extending for upwards
of 1,000 miles at a little distance from the Australian mainland,
represents one of the most productive areas for this marine delicacy, the
bulk of which goes to the Chinese market. The fishery is prosecuted with
the assistance mainly of the Queensland natives, who, either by diving or
wading on the reefs at low tide, collect the creatures in vast quantities.
On being brought to the curing-stations, the animals are emptied from the
collecting-sacks into large caldrons, where they are allowed to stew in
their own juice for about twenty minutes. Taken out of the caldrons, they
are split open and eviscerated, dried for a short interval in the sun, and
then placed in tiers on wire gratings in a smoke-house, where they remain
for twenty-four hours. They should at this stage have shrunk up to about
one quarter of their normally extended size, much resemble charred sausages
in aspect, and should rattle like dry walnuts when bagged up for
exportation. From £50 to £150 per ton are the prices that the better
qualities of bêche-de-mer realise when well cured and delivered at Chinese
ports. The chief culinary use to which the cured sea-cucumbers are applied
is that of the concoction of soup, the best quality prepared taking rank
with that made from swallows' nests. At the hotels and clubs in the leading
Australian cities bêche-de-mer soup is held in high favour, and its more
extensive introduction on the menu-cards of Western civilisation may be
only a question of time.

A BRANCHING-ARMED BRITTLE-STAR.

The specimen is attached to a brilliant scarlet sponge.]

Many species of sea-cucumbers inhabit British seas, but none possess that
density of tissue which is essential for their economic conservation; the
majority, moreover, are of comparatively small size, some few inches long
only when fully extended, whereas the commercially valuable tropical ones
may measure as much as from 2 to 3 feet. The mode of feeding of
sea-cucumbers is somewhat interesting; the smaller species, with
much-branching tentacles, generally affix themselves by their tube-feet to
some object, and, extending their tentacles in all directions, utilise
them, like those of a sea-anemone, for seizing any minute and suitable prey
which may strike against them. The microscopic organisms on which they
chiefly feed abound in the waters they inhabit, and one after the other,
the branched tentacles having effected a capture, are gathered together and
tucked bodily into the creature's central mouth and apparently half-way
down its throat. The larger coral-frequenting species are provided mostly
with mop-shaped tentacles. They crawl about leisurely in search of their
food, mopping over the ground, and gathering up in their tentacles the
minute shells and other organisms on which they subsist, which are
collectively thrust with an indrawn tentacle into the throat. In some of
the lower forms the tube-feet have disappeared, the integument is thin and
semi-transparent, and the worm-like animal crawls about by means of its
skin-spinules, which take the form of anchors or grappling-hooks. In an
opposite direction they may develop a supplementary covering of dermal
plates and a more rigid integument, which indicate their nearer
relationship with sea-urchins.

SEA-CUCUMBERS, SOME WITH EXTENDED TENTACLES.

A West Australian species whose colours are bright pink and yellow.]

The majority of sea-urchins and star-fishes pass through a series of
interesting metamorphoses before arriving at the adult state. The larval
phases in these instances are free-swimming organisms, having arm-like
processes, strengthened by calcareous rods that have been likened in
contour to a clock-stand. A small spherical central area, like a clock in
its case, representing the stomach of the larva, develops spicules around
it, and becomes the body of the urchin, the other outlying portions
becoming gradually absorbed. Some of the brittle-stars and sea-cucumbers
bring forth their young in the adult form, nursing them from the egg in
special breeding-chambers.

SEA-CUCUMBER, OR BÊCHE-DE-MER.

These animals are collected in vast quantities on the Australian Great
Barrier Reef, smoked, and sent to the Chinese market.]

The capacity of a star-fish to renew its lost arms is commonly manifested.
A single detached arm, moreover, in such a type as the common five-fingered
species, can reproduce its body and the remaining four arms. Fishermen, who
are in the habit of tearing up star-fishes and throwing them back into the
water, under the impression that they are thus effectually incapacitating
them from further injury to their oyster-beds, commit an error, such
mutilation tending to the multiplication of their numbers.

PRICKLY SEA-CUCUMBER.

This species of bêche-de-mer commands a high price in China, and makes

In the matter of colour-ornamentation the Star-fish group is richly
endowed. Allusion to the brilliant crimson and pink-and-white tints of the
British sun star-fish has been already made. As with most animal groups,
however, it is amid their tropical representatives that the most striking
colour-variations obtain. One form which is common among the coral-reefs on
the Queensland coast-line, and much resembles the common British
"five-fingers" in size and shape, is brilliant ultramarine-blue. Another
large pentagonal species, belonging to the group known as Cushion-stars,
has a golden-brown ground, upon which are thickly scattered small bead-like
tubercles of turquoise. A third form, not uncommon on the Tasmanian
coast-line, which is nearly related to the Bird's-foot species, previously
mentioned, is distinguished by tints which range through several shades of
crimson to brilliant violet.

Not a few of the star-fishes are notable for their eminent phosphorescent
properties. The group of the Snake-armed and Brittle-stars are more
especially distinguished in this respect. Many of these species occur in
such numbers in comparatively deep water that the dredge may be filled with
a tangled mass of their writhing snake-armed bodies. Should it be night
when the dredge is brought aboard, and its contents are emptied upon the
deck, the spectacle presented as the star-fishes scramble in all
directions, their bodies and arms aglow with pale green or blue phosphoric
coruscations, is highly remarkable.

CHAPTER IV.

_MOSS-ANIMALS._


A little group of animals whose relationship with the sub-divisions
previously and hereafter described cannot be very definitely determined is
that of the MOSS-ANIMALS, sometimes designated CORALLINES, or LACE-CORALS.
All its members are of exceedingly minute size, and if living separately
would be scarcely discernible to the unaided vision. They are, however, in
the habit of forming stocks, or colonies, after the manner of corals, by a
process of continual budding, and in this way build up social aggregations
which may be of considerable dimensions. The majority are marine, and
largely in evidence on almost every seashore in the form of the so-called
SEA-MATS, consisting of masses of minute, light brown, horny cells, which
take the form of seaweeds, or are spread in thin, lace-like encrustations
upon the surfaces of shells, stones, and the larger seaweeds. The living
inhabitants of these cells are as transparent as glass, their most
characteristic feature being the elegant shuttle-cock-shaped crown of
tentacles which is thrust out or withdrawn at will from the aperture of
each tiny tenement. The assistance of the microscope is requisite for the
apprehension of these details, as also of the somewhat complex alimentary
and other organs enclosed within the component cells.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent>, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

MOSS-ANIMALS.

These coral-like masses are composed of many thousand closely united
dwelling-cells of microscopic dimensions.]

A comparatively small number of these moss-animals are inhabitants of
fresh-water, forming brown tubular aggregations on the under side of the
leaves of water-lilies or other submerged objects. It is interesting to
observe that the tentacular crown in almost all these fresh-water species
is horseshoe-shaped, instead of like a shuttle-cock, as in the marine
forms. One very notable fresh-water species is remarkable for the
circumstance that in place of horny tubes the component individuals secrete
a common transparent gelatinous matrix, which is provided with a
creeping-base, wherewith the colony-stock is enabled to travel over the
surfaces of the water-plants among which it lives, or up the glass sides of
an aquarium. In some respects, and more especially their earlier
developmental phases, the Moss-animals show affinities with the
Lamp-shells, while the tentacular crown of the adult individual is closely
imitated in certain worms.




----



CHAPTER V.

_WORMS._


The WORMS and their allies embrace a numerous assemblage of animals which
exhibit a remarkable amount of variation both in structure and habits. A
fundamental distinction which serves to separate readily even the most
highly organised members of the group from the other articulate or
jointed-bodied animals, such as Crabs, Insects, or Centipedes, is furnished
by the character of the locomotive appendages. These in the Worm Tribe
never assume a jointed character, but take the form of unjointed membranous
processes which may or may not be supplemented by bristles. Frequently
bristles alone constitute the essential locomotive organs. In certain
groups, such as the Leeches, Flat-worms, Thread-worms, and others, even
these are unrepresented.

The appropriate title of BRISTLE-WORMS has been conferred upon the section
in which the locomotive organs take the form of bristles. Among these the
COMMON EARTH-WORM is included. At first sight the worm's body appears to be
perfectly smooth and naked; it is found, however, on closer investigation
to be furnished, according to the species, with either two or four
longitudinal rows of fine, hook-like bristles. Although these bristles
project but slightly above the surface of the skin, they constitute very
effective aids to locomotion, enabling the animal to obtain a secure grip
upon the surface of the ground over which it may be travelling. Progression
under such conditions is effected, in fact, on the same principle as that
of the snake, the ends of the stiff bristles with which the segments are
armed fulfilling the same role as the projecting edges of the reptile's
scales. Earth-worms are chiefly vegetable-feeders, dragging into their
holes fallen leaves, straws, and every other description of vegetable
débris. They also swallow and pass through their systems large quantities
of earth, absorbing from it its organic constituents, and depositing the
indigestible residuum therefrom in the form of "earth-casts." The useful
function thus performed by worms in bringing up earth from considerable
depths and redepositing it upon the surface of the ground has been fully
demonstrated in one of Mr. Darwin's works. There are some twenty species of
British earth-worms, none of which, however, attain to the proportions of
certain kinds indigenous to Australia and South Africa. Some of these giant
species are as much as 3 or 4 feet long when unextended, and will on the
stretch measure twice such lengths. Their thickness, which is
proportionate, may vary from that of a man's finger to that of an ordinary
sausage.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

TUBE-WORMS.

Some with their flower-like gill-tufts expanded.]

The most numerically abundant and structurally varied representatives of
the bristle-bearing worms are inhabitants of the sea, and are divisible
into two easily recognised natural groups. In one of these the animals
resemble earth-worms in their ability to move about freely from place to
place. In the other group they secrete and permanently reside within a
tubular edifice, which may be calcareous and of shell-like hardness, or
composed of particles of sand, mud, or other substances. The free-roving
group, which embraces by far the larger number, includes such forms as the
LUG-WORM, or LOB-WORM (held in high repute for fishing-baits), and a host
of other allied species. In all of these the development of bristles and
other appendages is more pronounced than in the Earth-worms. In another
group, known as the NEREIDS, the elongate worm-like body is more or less
flattened in shape; unjointed leg-like appendages, supplemented by
bristles, are developed from the majority of the segments, and the animal
presents a somewhat centipede-like aspect. This likeness is further
enhanced by the presence of antennæ-like organs at the anterior extremity,
while the mouth is armed internally with a pair of sharp-pointed, horny
jaws. In many of the nereids the lateral organs are flattened out and
paddle-like, constituting effective swimming-structures. Some of the larger
species attain a length of several feet, and are especially noteworthy for
the brilliantly iridescent tinting of their skins. The palm of beauty with
respect to its brilliant colouring must undoubtedly, however, be awarded to
the so-called SEA-MOUSE, frequently cast up by storms on the British coast.
In this creature the body is comparatively short and thick, 3 or 4 inches
long by 1½ to 2 inches wide. The centre of the back is covered in by a
felt-like mass of fine interlacing hairs of a brownish hue, underneath
which are broad, flat scales which protect the breathing-apparatus. The
sides are, however, thickly clothed with long, slender hairs and bristles,
each of which reflects the most brilliant prismatic tints.

SEA-WORMS, OR NEREIDS.

Their innumerable "false feet" impart to them a centipede-like aspect.]

The TUBE-DWELLING WORMS are noteworthy for the elegant and often
beautifully coloured flower-like gill-tuft with which the head is crowned.
Its separate filaments are clothed with vibrating hairs, which create
currents bringing food-particles to the mouth. In those forms which build
up a hard calcareous dwelling-tube, one of the gill-filaments is usually so
modified as to constitute a stopper-like organ, wherewith the animal, on
retreating into its domicile, can effectually bar out the ingress of
intruders. In some members of the group the gill-tufts are elegantly
branched and supplemented by long, simple, thread-like filaments, that are
thrust out to long distances in every direction both for food and the
materials required for the further lengthening and enlargement of the tube.

The LEECHES differ essentially from the Bristle-worms in the absence of
bristles or supplementary appendages, in the presence of an adhesive
sucking-disk at the posterior and sometimes also the anterior extremity,
and on their well-known blood-sucking propensities. While the MEDICINAL and
so-called HORSE-LEECHES inhabit fresh-water, some, more especially in
tropical countries, infest the moist jungles and scrubs in vast numbers,
and are among the most actively aggressive pests with which the traveller
has to contend. A few leeches also inhabit the sea, preying upon the skate
and other fishes. The bodies of these marine species are cylindrical, with
a sucker at each extremity, and roughly corrugated or warted.

The FLAT-WORMS embrace a large number of intestinal and other parasitic
species, including TAPE-WORMS, THREAD-WORMS, LIVER-FLUKES, and others.
Among the free-living non-parasitic members of this group, the so-called
INDIA-RUBBER-WORM is remarkable for the extraordinary elasticity of its
tissues. Black in hue, it lives among rocks and seaweeds, and preys upon
small fishes and other organisms. These, being seized by the suctorial
mouth, are unable to effect their escape, the worm's body being capable of
stretching out to a length of 20 feet or more, and "playing" the captured
victim like a living elastic fishing-line until its struggles are
exhausted.

CHAPTER VI.

_CORALS, SEA-ANEMONES, AND JELLY-FISHES._


With the Sea-anemones and Jelly-fishes almost the lowest organised group of
living animals is reached. As typified by an ordinary sea-anemone, the body
may be described as a simple sac, the orifice of which is inverted for some
little distance, and held in position with relation to the outer wall by a
series of radiating partitions. One or more rows of tentacles, varying in
number and character according to the species, surround the mouth of this
partially inverted sac. There is no distinct intestinal track, the whole
space enclosed within the outer wall and ramifying among the radiating
partitions containing the digestive juices. The radiating membranous
partitions develop upon their surfaces the reproductive elements, and in
the case of Corals, which are merely skeleton-producing sea-anemones,
partly secrete within them the symmetrical radiating calcareous plates so
characteristic of the group.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

PART OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF OF AUSTRALIA.

Chiefly composed of star-corals, many of them resembling human skulls. The
Great Barrier Reef of Australia, consisting of innumerable detached reefs
and coral-islets, is over 1,500 miles in length.]

Some thirty odd species of sea-anemones are indigenous to British waters,
and one or more of these will be familiar to most readers. The
STRAWBERRY-ANEMONE, clinging to the rocks as a hemispherical lump of
crimson, green, brown, or red and yellow speckled jelly when the tide is
down, and expanding like a beautiful flower when the waters flow back upon
it, is the commonest and in many respects the most beautiful of all, the
circlet of turquoise beads, regarded as rudimentary eyes, developed around
the outer margin of the tentacles, adding a charm possessed by few other
species. The DAHLIA-ANEMONE, whose expanded disk and innumerable petal-like
tentacles may measure as much as 6 or 8 inches in diameter, is the largest
British species. These dimensions are, however, vastly exceeded by its
tropical allies. The Australian coast produces giant species which may
measure no less than from 18 inches to 2 feet across their expanded disks.
These giant anemones are further interesting on account of the circumstance
that they are self-constituted "harbours of refuge" to sundry species of
fishes and crabs, which nestle among their tentacles like birds in a leafy
bower. The anemones are themselves bright in colour, but the associated
fishes are even more so. In an example which was photographed by the writer
on the Western Australian coast, the anemone was olive-green, with the tips
of the tentacles bright mauve. The fishes, of which three examples were
present, were brilliant orange-scarlet with white bands. In addition to the
fishes a small flat-clawed crab shared the sheltering hospitality of the
anemone. Some of the tropical coral-reef-frequenting anemones, which have
their tentacles beautifully branched, must be cautiously handled, in
consequence of their notable stinging properties. All sea-anemones and
corals are, in fact, provided with peculiar stinging-cells, with which they
benumb and thus make an easy capture of the living organisms on which they
prey. While the majority of the sea-anemones live single or individually
separate lives, there are some which form aggregations or colony-stocks of
numerous units. These compound growths are brought about by repeated
budding, or the sub-division or fission, without complete separation, of an
originally single individual. It is by a similar process of recurrent
sub-division that the wonderful fabrications of the coral-polyps are built
up.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

BLEACHED CORALS FROM THE GREAT BARRIER REEF.

Branching stag's horn corals are chiefly represented in this group. Several
of the large solitary mushroom-corals may, however, be observed in the
foreground.]

An ordinary coral-animal or polyp, as previously stated, differs in no
respect from a sea-anemone, excepting for the possession of a calcareous
skeleton secreted within its basal tissues, including portions of the
membranous radiating partitions. Some coral-animals, like the majority of
the Anemones, are solitary, and form single attached or loosely lying
corals. The well-known MUSHROOM-CORAL is one of the latter. One species
observed, which was photographed through the water by the writer as it lay
expanded in a tide-pool on the Australian Great Barrier Reef, might easily
be mistaken for a big sea-anemone allied to the dahlia-anemone. On being
disturbed, however, it immediately shrinks back upon its base, ejecting all
the water with which its expanded tissues were filled, and revealing the
presence of the hard radiating coral beneath. Each of the calcareous radii,
which are now clearly defined through the thin semi-transparent skin,
corresponds in position with one of the internal membranous partitions, and
also with the origin of one of the tentacles. New mushroom-corals are
produced as buds thrown off from the parent, which attach themselves and
secrete a foot-stalk, to which they remain affixed, like the young of the
feather star-fish, for the earlier epoch of their existence. Ultimately,
however, they become detached, and, falling from their stalks, lie loosely
on the sea-bottom, after the manner of their parents. The huge coral-masses
commonly known as MADREPORES, out of which coral-islands and reefs are
constructed, all commence as a single coral-animal, with its contained
skeleton analogous to the mushroom-coral, though in all instances much
smaller. The buds developed by the coral-polyp in these instances remain
attached to the parent. If they spread out laterally, they build up by
accumulation the large flattened or sub-spherical masses known as
BRAIN-CORALS and STAR-CORALS, which are most abundant on coast-line reefs,
or form the bases of the outer barrier-reefs. Where, on the other hand, the
budding is terminal or oblique, branching tree-like growths such as the
STAG'S-HORN CORALS, with their innumerable allies and variations, are
produced. The colours of the coral-polyps are as brilliant and diverse as
those of ordinary sea-anemones, living reefs, whereon a number of different
species are in a condition of healthy growth, yielding a spectacular effect
that vies with that of any floral parterre. Sometimes large areas, acres
upon acres in extent, may be covered with one almost uniform purple, green,
brown, or other coloured growth of the branching stag's-horn species. The
aspect presented is not unlike that of a heath-covered common.

In addition to the solid, calcareous-skeletoned Madrepores, or "Stony
Corals," as they are often termed, there are a number of species in which a
skeleton composed only of loosely aggregated calcareous spicules is
produced. The so-called FLEXIBLE CORALS, or SEA-FANS, belong to this
category, as also the precious CORAL OF COMMERCE. In the last-named species
the solid, brilliantly coloured skeleton so much prized as an article of
jewellery is deposited as a supplementary basis outside the tissues by
which the star-patterned skeletons of the stony corals are secreted.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

A QUEENSLAND STAR-CORAL.

This species in life is of a pale lemon-yellow tint.]

A group which demands brief notice is that of the HYDROID POLYPS. These
include the majority of the JELLY-FISHES, a few coral-secreting species,
and the organisms whose seaweed-like horny skeletons, known as SEA-FIRS,
are, in common with those of Sea-mats, included among the flotsam and
jetsam on every sea-beach. In the COMMON HYDRA, or FRESHWATER POLYP, an
exceptional fresh-water representative of this group is presented. It may
be likened to a tiny sea-anemone, having, when extended, a slender
foot-stalk and long thread-like tentacles. Like a sea-anemone, it will
shrink up when disturbed into a mere button of jelly. Its organisation is
more simple than that of the anemone, its body-cavity being a simple sac,
without any intucking of the orifice, or strengthening by supplementary
membranous partitions. A similar simple structural plan is characteristic
of all the organisms belonging to the series. An interesting phenomenon
connected with the fresh-water hydra is the circumstance, demonstrated now
over a century ago, that, if one of these animals be cut up into little
pieces, each separate fragment is capable of repairing itself and growing
into a new polyp.

The JELLY-FISHES, or MEDUSAS, and their allies would appear at first sight
to possess but little structurally in common with the Coral-polyps and
Sea-anemones. In their most familiar form they are represented by a more or
less translucent bell-shaped body, which drifts with the current or propels
itself through the water by its alternate expansions and contractions. In
the centre of the lower surface, occupying the position of the bell's
clapper, a polyp-like, tubular mouth is usually discernible, and this is
frequently surrounded by a circle of tentacles, sometimes simple and
sometimes elaborately ramified. Long, thread-like tentacles are also
commonly developed around the margin of the swimming-bell.

A GIANT ANEMONE FROM THE GREAT BARRIER REEF.

The larger number of the jellyfishes are, as a matter of fact, transitional
phases only of the fixed hydroid polyps previously referred to. In certain
instances the body of the fixed polyp becomes elongated, and splits up
horizontally into a series of jelly-fishes, or medusas, resembling a pile
of saucers, which consecutively break away and lead a free-roving
existence. In other forms a compound tree-like growth gives birth to
medusa-like buds, like the flowers on a plant, which ultimately become
detached and swim away. What are known as the COMB-BEARING
JELLY-FISHES--their locomotive organs consisting of comb-like bands of
vibratile hairs--are especially noteworthy. In some of these the body is
nearly spherical or ovate, one of the species, in reference to its shape,
being popularly known as the SEA-LEMON. A notable feature of these medusas
is their remarkable glass-like transparency, their presence in the water in
many instances being recognisable only by the prismatic glimmerings of
their rows of vibratile hairs when the light falls upon them at a
favourable angle. The most remarkable member of this particular group is
undoubtedly the form known as VENUS'S GIRDLE. This species takes the form
of a long, ribbon-like band of transparent jelly. The edges of the ribbon
are clothed with vibratile hairs, and the mouth is situated in the centre
of one of the edges. The animal progresses by the action of its hairs
alone, or may be assisted by the twistings and undulations of its
ribbon-like body.

with companion or "commensal" fish and crabs of brilliant colour. The fish
cruise round in search of food, but always return to shelter among the
anemone's tentacles. Photograph taken through the water.]

Many jelly-fishes possess an unenviable reputation with reference to their
stinging properties. The so-called PORTUGUESE MAN-OF-WAR is one of the more
noteworthy of these. The organism consists of an ovately pointed
air-bladder, which floats on the water, and from which depend numerous
nutritive polyps and a mass of capturing-filaments, or tentacles.

CHAPTER VII.

_SPONGES AND ANIMALCULES._


The Sponges are regarded as a group standing on the borderland between the
Polyps and the lowly organisms which follow. The familiar BATH- and
TOILET-SPONGES of commerce represent but an insignificant fraction in
comparison with the many hundred species which find no place in the world's
market. Toilet-sponges owe their intrinsic value to the relative fineness
and elasticity of their component fibrous skeletons. In these particular
species the skeleton is composed of a substance akin to horn. In other
sponges the skeleton may consist of horny fibres mixed with flinty
spicules, or it may be of flint only, or of spicules of carbonate of lime.
Finally, there are sponges which possess no internally supporting skeleton,
fibrous or spicular, and whose substance is consequently little more than
gelatinous. All these numerous forms, however, agree with one another in
the identity of their most essential vital elements. In the living sponge
the skeleton, fibrous or otherwise, is embedded within a gelatinous matrix
by whose component cells it is excreted. Externally the sponge-body is
perforated over the greater portion of its extent by minute holes or pores,
while one or more holes of relatively large size occupy the summit of the
sponge, or are scattered here and there among the numerous smaller pores.
The smaller pores represent incurrent apertures, and lead to chambers
within the sponge's substance lined by cells. Each of these is provided
with a long whip-like appendage, with a transparent wineglass-shaped cup or
collar, which is a beautifully constructed food-trap. The lashings of the
whips of the collar-cells cause currents of water bearing nutrient
particles to flow in at all the smaller pores. Arriving at the chambers,
these particles are caught by the outstretched collar-traps and absorbed
into the cell's substance. The water, together with rejected and waste
materials given off by the sponge-body, is carried forward, and passes out
at the larger orifices or vents.

RETICULATED SPONGE.

The skeleton of this sponge is composed of fine horny fibres resembling
those of ordinary commercial sponges.]

Among the more remarkable sponges may be mentioned the NEPTUNE'S-CUP
SPONGE, like a huge chalice 3 or 4 feet high, indigenous to the South Seas;
the wonderful cornucopia-shaped LACE-SPONGE, consisting of a lace-like
reticulation of flinty fibres; and its near ally the GLASS-ROPE SPONGE,
forming a cup- or bird's-nest-shaped body, supported on a long cylindrical
stalk of flinty fibres that may be over a foot in height. One of the
compound or social sea-anemones is in the habit of forming bark-like
encrustations on this glassy stem, and it was for a long time doubtful
whether the sea-anemone or the sponge produced the supporting-stalk.

CHALINA SPONGE.

A British species, composed partly of horny and partly of flinty elements.]

The ANIMALCULES, which represent the simplest and lowest forms of living
animals, consist chiefly of organisms which are the equivalents of one of
the single cells, or, as they might be termed, the "life-bricks," out of
which all the higher animals, and also plants, are built up. They are of
minute dimensions, and require the aid of the microscope for their proper
investigation. Among the most highly organised members of this sub-kingdom
mention must be made of the CILIATED ANIMALCULES, or INFUSORIA, so called
because they were first discovered inhabiting decaying vegetable and animal
infusions. The so-called SLIPPER-ANIMALCULE is one of the commonest forms
which makes its appearance amidst such environments. The length of this
single-celled animal scarcely averages the one-hundredth part of an inch,
but within this restricted space an amazing degree of structural and
functional differentiation is included. Its outer surface is, in the first
place, densely clothed with hairs, which represent its organs of
locomotion. This outer cell-wall has a subjacent somewhat softer layer, in
which are developed as crowded a series (as compared with the hairs) of
minute rod-like bodies, which, under various stimuli, can be shot out like
darts through the skin, and are adjudged to be offensive and defensive
weapons, partaking much of the same nature as the thread- or stinging-cells
of sea-anemones. Among other noteworthy structures, the slipper-animalcule
has a distinct throat-opening, two rhythmically contracting cavities
fulfilling a respiratory function and a complex reproductive nodule, or
nucleus. Compared with a host of its kindred, this animalcule is a giant,
the longest diameter of many of the smaller varieties measuring no more
than the 1/5000th part of inch, or even less.

The elegant little BELL-ANIMALCULE, with its crystal wineglass-shaped body,
crown of vibrating hairs, and long spirally contractile foot-stalk, is a
familiar object to the possessor of a microscope. Most commonly these
single-celled organisms, like the single-celled elements of organic
tissues, multiply by repeated sub-division, the number that can be
reproduced in a short space of time by this simple process being almost
incredible. As many as a million, it has been calculated, of some species
may be thus derived from an original single individual within twenty hours.
In this connection these lowly organisms can among living animals most
logically lay claim to immortality. The individual, in point of fact, never
dies. Finding itself growing old and obese at the ripe age of, say, sixty
minutes, it has simply to split itself up into two offsets, which swim away
and repeat the process. Occasionally, for the rejuvenescence of the race,
two individuals coalesce completely with one another, and multiplication by
splitting takes place.

Some near relations of the little bell-animalcule, while sub-dividing so
far as their bodies are concerned, remain united by their foot-stalks, and
thus in time build up beautiful tree-like structures, laden as it were with
crystal bells or fruit. In some of these the common branching foot-stalk is
erect and rigid, while in others it is flexible, and contains, as in the
ordinary species, a central elastic ligament. Under these circumstances the
whole tree-like structure, with its crystal bells, collapses and expands
again under the slightest stimulus, and constitutes one of the most
beautiful objects that can be viewed through the microscope.

[Illustration: Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S.]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

CUP-SPONGES, PHOTOGRAPHED AS GROWING IN A CORAL-POOL.

The Neptune's cup Sponge, allied to this species, is sometimes 2 or 3 feet
in height and diameter.]

In lower forms of the infusorial animalcules one or more long, lash-like
organs take the place of locomotive hairs. In this category are included
the COLLAR-BEARING ANIMALCULES. Some of these build up tree-like growths by
repeated sub-divisions and imperfect separation, after the manner of the
bell-animalcules, while others excrete tubular dwelling-cases, inhabited by
the resultants of the splitting process. Such forms can with difficulty be
distinguished from skeletonless sponges.

The animalcule NOCTILUCA, which by its countless myriads is the chief
constituent of ocean phosphorescence, is a member of the Lash-bearing
group. This noteworthy form invites a somewhat more extended notice. It is
to the presence of the Noctiluca in countless myriads upon the upper
stratum of the water on calm summer nights that is especially due the
diffused form of phosphorescence which is more essentially characteristic
of temperate latitudes. Under the most favourable of these conditions, the
waves falling upon the strand leave as they retreat a glittering carpet of
scintillating points; the oars of the passing boat seem as it were to dip
into molten silver; while on the high seas the revolving screw or paddle of
the steam-vessel leaves in its wake a broad, luminous track as far as the
eye can reach. A glassful of water taken from the sea at such times
immediately reveals the origin of these wonderful phenomena. Here and there
will be seen floating minute bladder-like transparent spheres, resembling
as nearly as possible small granules of boiled sago. Investigated more
closely with the microscope, each individual speck will be found to exhibit
a pouch-like contour, having a central furrow, from which the lash
projects, and upon which the minute mouth-aperture opens. Irritated by
agitation in any shape or form, the Noctilucas at once respond by, as it
were, angry flashes of silvery-greenish light, and it is to the
coruscations in their aggregate condition of many millions of these minute
organisms that the several phenomena above recounted are produced.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

SHELLS OF FORAMS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED.

The chalk cliffs of Dover and many other strata are mainly composed of
similar microscopically minute shells.]

One other characteristic manifestation of ocean phosphorescence dependent
upon the presence in countless numbers of these minute animalcules may be
recorded. To those accustomed to a seafaring life the spectacle is a common
one, on nights when the luminosity is most in evidence, of fishes following
or darting away from the sides of the vessel apparently aglow themselves
with phosphoric light, and leaving behind them, in accordance with their
size, a more or less conspicuous luminous path in the murky waters. It is
commonly supposed that such form of luminosity is emitted by the fishes
themselves; but on closer investigation it will be found that this also is
due to the presence of the animalcules under notice in countless numbers,
which are disturbed into a sudden display of their phosphoric properties by
the passage of the fishes through their midst. This light is reflected, as
from a mirror, by the fishes' glittering scales, while the Noctilucas
continue scintillating for several seconds in the path or wake through
which the fishes have passed.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

NOCTILUCAS.

These are the animalcules which chiefly produce marine phosphorescence.]

There are other animalcules nearly allied to Noctilucas which sometimes
occur in such vast abundance in both salt and fresh water as to visibly
affect its character. In addition to a very long lash they have a girdle of
vibratile hairs. The fresh-water representatives of this group are
sometimes brilliant green, at others bright scarlet. That instance among
the Biblical Egyptian plagues in which the water of the Nile was as it were
"turned to blood, and all the fish died," has been attributed to a
phenomenal development of these animalcules, which, on dying, polluted and
putrefied the water. Instances of fishes being destroyed in vast quantities
through a like agency throughout even extensive sea-areas have been
occasionally recorded. While these pages are going to press an account has
appeared in an American journal of red water caused by these flagellate
animalcules, which occurred last July for an extent of at least 200 miles
along the coast of California, producing with their decomposition a most
sickening odour, and the death of shoals of fishes, octopods,
sea-cucumbers, and other organisms.

[Illustration: _Photo by W. Saville-Kent, F.Z.S._]     [_Milford-on-Sea._

POLYCYSTS.

Flinty-shelled organisms of microscopic dimensions. The living animals
consist of tiny specks of transparent jelly, from which radiate innumerable
false feet of hair-like fineness.]

Next to the Flagellates come the ROOT-FOOTED ANIMALCULES, which possess no
mouth and no hairs or lashes, but progress by pushing out lobes of their
jelly-like substance in any desired direction, into which the rest of the
body flows. Food is picked up at any point with which an acceptable morsel
may be brought in contact. The little gelatinous animal known as an AMOEBA
is one of these. Related forms of this jelly animalcule secrete shells of
varying form and structure. Some of these, known as FORAMS, are of
carbonate of lime, and wonderfully like nautiluses and other of the higher
molluscan shells in aspect. Though so minute, scarcely visible to the
unassisted eye, they occur in the sea in such numbers as to form by their
aggregations the more considerable ingredients of vast areas of the earth's
strata, both past and present. The chalk cliffs of Albion and the white
tenacious ooze of the broad Atlantic are thus to a large extent composed of
the shells of minute organisms, which formerly flourished near the surface
of the ocean, but sank on their death to its abysmal depths.

The simplest of the forams fabricate shells with a single chamber, which
are often elegantly vase- or flask-shaped. More usually, however, the shell
represents the product of repeated buddings or outgrowths, and may attain
considerable dimensions. Flattened circular forms of this type much
resemble time-worn coins, and are hence called NUMMULITES. Their
fossil-shells enter mainly into the composition of rocks which extend
through North Africa and Asia to the Himalaya, and supplied the stone of
which the Pyramids are built.

Allied to the Forams, but distinguished by the radiating, needle-like
contour of their false feet and the flinty texture of their shells, are an
equally numerous assemblage of organisms known as RADIOLARIANS. Like the
Forams, they are inhabitants of the sea, and their discarded shells enter
extensively into the constitution of strata. A little globular fresh-water
form, devoid of a shell, and with slender bristle-like feet radiating in
every direction, is known as the SUN-ANIMALCULE, and forms a
connecting-link between the last two groups.



From Man to Egg-laying Mammals, Molluscs to Animalcules, the vast scheme of
the Animal Creation has now been successively portrayed. With such simple
gelatinous life-specks as the Amoeba and its allies THE LIVING ANIMALS OF
THE WORLD make their exit: unorganised organisms, groping blindly in the
darkness--"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
