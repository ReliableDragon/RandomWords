How To Use This Book 


This hardcover Monstrous Manual was created in response to the 
many requests to gather monsters into a single, durable volume which 
would be convenient to carry. With the DUNGEON MASTER™ Guide 
fDMG) and the Player's Handbook iPHB), the Monstrous Minted 
forms the core of the AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition game* 

Every monster from the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM* Volumes 
One and Two are contained within, as well as a few creatures from 
later volumes. The monsters in the Monstrous Manual have been re¬ 
vised, edited, and updated. Statistics for many of the creatures have 
been corrected, new information has been added to many of the en¬ 
tries, and many monsters have been reclassified* There are some new 
beasts, as well. In cases of conflicting information, the Monstrous 
Manual supersedes all previously published data . 

Certain entries have been greatly condensed from MONSTROUS 
COMPENDIUM entries, to make this book as complete as possible 
without increasing its size or price. For instance, there is a full-page 
description of ravens in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appen¬ 
dix for the GREY HAWK* campaign setting; in this book, ravens are 
given only a few' lines in the "Bird" entry. This provides enough infor¬ 
mation to use the creatures for a short encounter, and it allows a page 
to be devoted to another adversary* 

To find a monster in this book, flip through the pages or look in the 
index, which contains listings for the common name(s) of every mon¬ 
ster in the book, referenced to the correct page. 

All of the monsters described here are typical for their type. DMs 
should note that unusual variations are encouraged, but they are 
most effective when they depart from the expected. Likewise, entries 
describe typical lairs for creatures, from the dungeon complexes they 
inhabit to the tree houses they build; changing the look of these can 
make a monster encounter unique. 

Contents 

This introduction describes how to interpret the monsters in this 
book. In addition, there are three small appendices in the back of the 
book. The first deals with making monsters. The second covers mon¬ 
ster summoning and includes tables for random determination of 
summoned creatures; to make random encounter charts for a cam¬ 
paign, the DM should refer to Chapter 11 of the DMG. The third 
appendix is concerned with creating NFC parties. 

Other Worlds 

Several of the monsters in this book have been imported from specialized 
game worlds, such as the SPELLJAMMERS campaign setting, the 
FORGOTTEN REALMS^ setting, or the DARK SUN’ world. The mon¬ 
sters in this book may be used in any setting; if a campaign setting is 
noted, it simply describes where the monster was first encountered, or 
where if is the most common. A particular monster sriJJ may not be en¬ 
countered in a specific campaign world; this is up to the DM. For mon¬ 
sters from one of the specific worlds, the DM should consult the 
appropriate MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendices. 

The Monsters 

Each monster is described fully with entries that describe behavior, 
combat modes, and so on. These are explained in the following text. 

CUMAXLTERRAIN def ines where the creature is most often found. 
Climates include arctic, sub-arctic, temperate, and tropical. Typical 
terrain includes plain/scrub, forest, rough/hill, mountain, swamp, 
and desert. In some cases, a range is given; for instance, "cold” im¬ 
plies arctic, sub-arcric, and colder temperate regions. 

FREQUENCY is the likelihood of encountering a creature in an area. 
Chances can be ad lusted for special areas. 


ORGANIZATION is the general social structure the monster adopts. 
"Solitary" includes small family groups. 

ACTIVITY CYCLE is the time of day when the monster is most active. 
Those active at night can be active at any time in subterranean settings. 
These are general guidelines and exceptions are fairly common. 

DIET shows what the creature usually eats. Carnivores eat meat, her¬ 
bivores eat plants, and omnivores eat either. Scavengers primarily 
eat carrion. If a monster does not fit any of these categories, the sub¬ 
stances it does eaL are described in the entry or in the text. 

INTELLIGENCE is the equivalent of human 'TQ. W Certain monsters 
are instinctively cunning; these are noted in the monster descriptions. 
Ratings correspond roughly to the following Intelligence ability 
scores: 


0 

Nonintelligent or not ratable 

1 

Animal intelligence 

2-4 

Semi-intelligent 

5-7 

Low intelligence 

6-10 

Average (human) intelligence 

11-12 

Very intelligent 

13-14 

Highly intelligent 

15-16 

Exceptionally intelligent 

17-1S 

Genius 

19-20 

Supra-genius 

21 + 

Godlike intelligence 


TREASURE refers to the treasure tables in the DUNGEON MASTER 
Guide . If individual treasure is indicated, each individual may carry 
it £or not, at the DM's discretion). Major treasures are usually found 
in the monster's lair; these are most often designed and placed by the 
DM, Intelligent monsters will use the magical items present and try to 
carry off their most valuable treasures if hard pressed. If treasure is 
assigned randomly, roll for each type possible; if all rolls fail no trea¬ 
sure of any type is found. Treasure should be adjusted dow nward if a 
few monsters are encountered. Large treasures are noted by a multi¬ 
plier ( x 10, for example); this should not be confused w ith treasure 
type X. Treasure types listed in parentheses are treasures found in the 
creatures' lair. Do not use the tables to place dungeon treasure, since 
the numbers encountered underground will be much smaller. 

ALIGNMENT shows the general behavior of the average monster of 
that type. Exceptions, though uncommon, may be encountered, 

NO. APPEARING indicates an average encounter size for a wilder¬ 
ness encounter. The DM should alter this to fit the circumstances as 
the need arises. This should not be used for dungeon encounters. 

Note that some solitary creatures are found in small groups; this 
means they are found in very small family units, or that several may 
happen to be found together, but do not cooperate with one another. 

ARMOR CLASS is the general protection worn by humans and hu¬ 
manoids, protection due to physical structure or magical nature, or 
difficulty in hitting due to speed, reflexes, etc. Humans and human¬ 
oids of roughly man-size that wear armor will have an unarmored 
rating in parentheses. Listed AC does not include any special bonuses 
noted in the description. 

MOVEMENT shows the relative speed rating of the creature. Higher 
speeds may be possible for short periods. Human, demihuman, and 
humanoid movement rate is often determined by armor type (unar¬ 
mored rates are given in parentheses). Movements in different medi¬ 
ums are abbreviated as follows: 


Very rare 
Rare 

Uncommon 

Common 


= 4% chance 
-11% chance 
-20% chance 
= 65% chance 


FI “ flying 

Sw = swimming 

Br - burrowing 

Cl 34 climbing 

Wb = moving across webs 




How To Use This Book 


Hying creatures also have a Maneuverability Class from A to E. 
Class A creatures have virtually total command over their move¬ 
ments in the air; they can hover, face any direction in a given round, 
and attack each round. Class B creatures are very' maneuverable; 
they can hover, turn ISO degrees in a round, and attack in each 
round, Qass C creatures are somewhat agile in the air; they cannot 
move less than half their movement rate without tailing, they can 
turn up to 90 degrees in a round, and attack aerially once every two 
rounds, Gass D creatures are somewhat slow; they cannot move less 
than half their movement rate without falling, can turn only 60 de¬ 
grees in a round, and can make a pass once every three rounds. Class 
E includes large, clumsy fliers; these cannot move less than hall their 
movement rate without falling, can turn only 30 degrees in a round, 
and they can make one pass every six rounds. See Chapter 9 of the 
DMG for more information. 

HIT DICE controls the number of hit points damage a creature can 
withstand before being killed. Unless otherwise stated, Hit Dice are 
8-sided (1-8 hit points). The Hit Dice are rolled and the numbers 
shown are added to determine the monster's hit points. Some mon¬ 
sters have a hit point spread instead of Hit Dice, and some have addi¬ 
tional points added to their Hit Dice. Thus, a creature with 4+4 Hit 
Dice has 4dB + 4 hit points (8-36 total). Note that creatures with +3 
or more hit points are considered the next higher Hit Die for purposes 
of attack rolls and saving throws. 

THACO is the attack roll the monster needs to hit Armor Class 0. 
This is always a function of Hit Dice, except in the case of very large, 
nonaggressive herbivores (such as some dinosaurs), or creatures 
which have certain innate combat abilities. A human or demihuman 
always uses a player character THACO, regardless of whether they 
are player characters or "monsters." The THACO does not include 
any special bonuses noted in the descriptions, 

NUMBER OF ATTACKS shows the basic attacks the monster can 
make in a melee round, excluding special attacks. This number can 
be modified by hits that sever members, spells such as haste and 
slow, and so forth. Multiple attacks indicate several members, raking 
paws, multiple heads, etc. 

DAMAGE ATTACK shows the amount of damage a given attack 
causes, expressed as a spread of hit points (based on a die roil or com¬ 
bination of die rolls) If the monster uses weapons, the damage done 
by the typical weapon will be allowed by the parenthetical note 
'weapon T Damage bonuses due to Strength are listed as a bonus fol¬ 
lowing the damage range. 

SPECIAL ATTACKS detail attack modes such as dragon breath, mag¬ 
ic use, etc. These are explained in the monster description, 

SPECIAL DEFENSES are precisely that , and are detailed in the mon¬ 
ster description. 

MAGIC RESISTANCE is the percentage chance that any magic cast 
upon the creature will tall to affect it, even if other creatures nearby 
are affected. If the magic penetrates the resistance, the creature is still 
entitled to any normal saving throw allowed. Creatures may have 
resistances to certain spells; this is not considered magic resistance," 
which is effective against all spells. 

SIZE is abbreviated as 

T = tiny (2’ tail or less): 

S *■= smaller than a typical human (2+" to 4'); 

M = man-sized (4+ to 7 
L = larger than man-sized (7+ to 12'); 

H = huge 02+ to 25'); and 
G = gargantuan '25 + 1. 

Most creatures are measured in height or length; some are measured 
in diameter. Those measured in diameter may be given a different 


size category than indicated above. For instance, while a 6-foot tali 
humanoid is considered size M, a spherical creature 6 feet in diameter 
has much more mass, so is considered size L. Similarly, a creature 12 
feet long with a very slender body (like a snake) might be considered 
only man-sized. Adjustments like these should not move a creature 
more than one size category in either direction, 

MORALE is a general rating of how likely the monster is to persevere 
in the face of adversity or armed opposition. This guideline can be 
adjusted for individual circumstances. Morale ratings correspond to 
the following range; 


2-4 

Unreliable 

5-7 

Unsteady 

8-10 

Average 

11-12 

Steady 

13-14 

Elite 

15-16 

Champion 

17-18 

Fanatic 

19-20 

Fearless 


XP VALUE is the number of experience points awarded for defeating, 
but not necessarily killing, the monster. This value is a guideline that 
can be modified by the DM for the degree of challenge, encounter 
situation, and for overall campaign balance. 

Combat is the part of the description that discusses special combat 
abilities, arms and armor, and tactics. 

Habitat'Soriety outlines the monsters general behavior, nature, so¬ 
cial structure, and goals, In some cases, it further describes their lairs 
(the places they live in), breeding habits, and reproduction rates. 

Ecology describes how the monster fits into the campaign world, 
gives any useful products or byproducts, and any other miscellane¬ 
ous information. 

Variations of a monster am given in a special section after the main mon¬ 
ster entry. These can be found by consulting the index. For instance, the 
xom entry also describes the xaren. a very similar creature. 

Psionics are mental powers possessed by many creatures in the Mon¬ 
strous Manual, The psionic listings are explained below': 

Level: How tough the monster is in terms of psionic experience level. 
DisfSciDev: How many disciplines the creature can access, followed 
by the total number of sciences and devotions the creature knows. 
Monsters can know sciences and devotions only from the disciplines 
they can access. 

AitackDefense: The telepathic attack and defense modes that the 
creature can use. Note that defense modes are not included in the 
total number of powers the creature knows. Abbreviations used are 
as follows: 


PB 

Psionic Blast 

M- 

Mind Blank 

MT 

Mind Thrust 

TS 

Thought Shield 

EW 

Ego Whip 

MB 

Mental Barrier 

II 

Id Insinuation 

IF 

Intellect Fortress 

PsC 

Psychic Crush 

TW 

Tower of Iron Will 


Power Score: The creatures usual score when using a power that is 
not automatically successful. 

PSPs: The creatures total pool of psionic strength points (the maxi¬ 
mum available to it). 

The rest of the listing indicates, by discipline, which powers the 
creature has, sometimes listing the most common powers, sometimes 
listing only the powers that all members of the species have. Unless 
otherwise noted, the creature always knows powers marked by an 
asterisk. 

For information regarding psionic powers, see PHBR5, The Com¬ 
plete Psionics Handbook, If the DM chooses not to use psionics in the 
campaign, the powers can be changed to magical equivalents or sim¬ 
ply ignored, though the latter severely impedes certain monsters.

The aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the 
peaks of the highest mountains, spending their days soaring on 
the thermal winds in peace and solitude. 

Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet. 
About halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with three 
hmman-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated 
fourth finger extends the length of the wing and locks in place for 
flying Though the wing-hands cannot grasp during flight, they 
are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is on the 
ground and its wings are folded back. The wing muscles anchor 
in a bony chest plate that provides the aarakocra with extra pro¬ 
tection. The powerful legs end in four sharp talons that can un¬ 
lock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands, 
also with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. 
The hand bones, like the rest of an aarakocra s skeleton, are hol¬ 
low and fragile, 

Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. 
They have grav-black beaks, and black eyes set frontally in their 
heads that provide keen binocular vision. Plumage color varies 
from tribe to tribe, but generally males are red, orange, and yel¬ 
low while females are brown and gray. 

Aarakocra speak their own language, the language of giant ea¬ 
gles, and, on occasion, the common tongue (10% chance). 

Combat: In aerial combat, an aarakocra fights with either tal¬ 
ons or the heavy fletched javelins that he dutches In his lower 
hands. An aarakocra typically carries a half dozen javelins 
strapped to his chest in individual sheaths. The javelins, which 
can be used for throwing or stabbing, inflict 2d4 points of dam¬ 
age. Owing to the aarakocra s remarkable skill at throwing jave¬ 
lins in the air, it incurs none of the attack penalties for aerial 
missile fire. An aarakocra will always save its last javelin for 
slabbing purposes rather than throwing it . Its favorite attack is to 
dive at a victim while clutching a javelin in each hand, then pul] 
out of the dive just as it reaches its target, and strike with a 
blood-curdling shriek. This attack gains a +4 bonus to the attack 
roll and causes double damage, but an aarakocra must dive at 
least 200 feet to execute it properly. 

An aarakocra is reluctant to engage in grappling or ground 
combat, since its fragile bones are easily broken. Though rarely 





used except when cornered, an aarakocra's sharp beak can bite 
for 1-3 points of damage. 

Habitat/Society: Aarakocra live in small tribes of about 11-30 
{Id20+IG) members, Each tribe has a hunting territory of about 
10,000 square miles with colorful banners and pennants marking 
the boundaries. 

Each tribe lives in a communal nest made of woven vines with 
a soft lining of dried grass. The eldest male serves as the tribe s 
leader. In tribes of more than 20 members, the second oldest male 
serves as the shaman, leading simple religious ceremonies involv¬ 
ing the whistling of melodic hymns at sunset on the first day of a 
new month. Males spend most of their waking hours hunting for 
food and occasionally for treasure, such as gems and other shiny 
objects. Females spend eight months of the year incubating their 
eggs, passing the time by fabricating javelins and other tools 
from wood and stone. While resting on their backs, aarakocra 
females can use all four hands at the same time to weave bound¬ 
ary pennants, javelins sheaths, and other useful objects from 
vines and feathers. 

Five aarakocra, including a shaman, can summon an air ele¬ 
mental by chanting and performing an intricate aerial dance for 
three melee rounds. The summoned air elemental will comply 
with the aarakocra^' request for a favor, though it will not endan¬ 
ger its life on their behalf. 

Aarakocra are extremely claustrophobic and will not willingly 
enter a cave, building, or other enclosed area. 

Ecology: Aarakocra have little to do with other species, includ¬ 
ing neighboring aarakocra tribes, and leave their home territory 
only in extreme circumstances. They rarely encounter humans 
except for an occasional foray into a rural community to sna tch a 
stray farm animal: this is not an intentionally malicious act as 
aarakocra are unable to distinguish between domestic and wild 
animals. A human venturing into aarakocra territory may be 
able to convince one to serve as a guide or a scout in exchange for 
a shiny jewel or coin.

The aboleth is a loathsome amphibious creature that lives in sub¬ 
terranean caves and lakes. It despises most land-dwelling crea¬ 
tures and seeks to enslave Intelligent surface beings. It is as cruel 
as it is intelligent. 

An aboleth resembles a plump fish, 20 feet in length I mm its 
bulbous head to its fluke-like fail. Its body is blue-green with 
gray splotches, and its pink-tan underbelly conceals a toothless, 
rubbery mouth. Three slit-like eyes, purple-red in color and pro¬ 
tected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its 
head. Four pulsating blue-black orifices line the bottom of its 
body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. Four 
leathery tentacles, each 10 feet in length, grow from its head. An 
aboleth uses its tail to propel itself through the water and its ten¬ 
tacles to drag itself along dry land. 

Combat The aboleth attacks with its tentacles tor ld6 points of 
damage each. If a victim struck by a tentacle fails a saving throw vs, 
spell, the victims skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane in 
ld4+l rounds. If this occurs, the victim must keep the membrane 
damp with cool water or suffer ldl2 points of damage each turn. 
Cure disease cast upon the victim before the membrane completely 
forms stops the transformation. Otherwise, cure serious wounds 
will cause the membrane to revert to normal skin. 

Because its sluggish movement makes attacks difficult, the 
aboleth attempts to lure victims dose by creating realistic illu¬ 
sions at will, complete with audible, olfactory, and other sensory 
components. The aboleth can attempt to enslave creatures within 
30 feet: it can make three attempts per day one creature per at¬ 
tempt. If the victim fails a saving throw vs. spell, he follows all of 
the aboleth's- telepathic commands, although the victim will not 
fight on the aboleth's behalf. The enslavement can be negated by 
remoue curse* dispel magic t the death of the enslaving aboleth, 
or, if the victim is separated from the aboleth by more than a 
mile, a new saving throw (one attempt per day) 

When underwater, an aboleth surrounds itself with a mucous 
cloud 1 foot thick, A victim in contact with the cloud and inhal¬ 



ing the mucus must roll a successful saving throw vs, poison or 
lose the ability to breathe air. The victim is then able to breathe 
water, as if having consumed a potion of water breathing* for 1-3 
hours. This ability may be renewed by additional contact with 
the mucous cloud. An affected victim attempting to breathe air 
will suffocate in 2d6 rounds. Wine or soap dissolves the mucus, 

Habitat/Society An aboleth brood consists of a parent and one 
to three offspring. Though the offspring are as large and as 
strong as the parent, they defer to the parent in all matters and 
obey it implicitly. 

Aboleth have both male and female sexual organs, A mature 
aboleth reproduces once every five years by concealing itself in a 
cavern or other remote area, then laying a single egg and cover¬ 
ing it in slime. The parent aboleth guards the egg while the em¬ 
bryo grows and develops, a process that takes about five years. 
A newborn aboleth takes about 10 years to mature. 

The aboleth spends most of its time searching for slaves, pref¬ 
erably human ones. It is rumored that the aboleth use their slaves 
to construct huge underwater cities, though none have ever been 
found. The aboleth are rumored to know ancient, horrible se¬ 
crets that predate the existence of man, but these rumors are also 
unsubstantiated. There is no doubt that aboleth retain a stagger¬ 
ing amount of knowledge. An offspring acquires all of its parent's 
knowledge at birth, and a mature aboleth acquires the knowl¬ 
edge of any intelligent being it consumes. 

An aboleth's treasure consists of items taken from its slaves. 
The items are buried in caverns under a layer of slime resembling 
gray mud, recognizable by the distinctive rancid grease odor. 

Ecology: The omnivorous aboleth will eat any organic matter, 
usually algae and micro-organisms, but they are also fond of in¬ 
telligent prey so they can absorb nutrients and information at the 
same time. Aboleth have no natural enemies, as even the mighti¬ 
est marine creatures give them a wide berth. Aboleth slime is 
sometimes used as a component for potions of water breathing .

The ankheg is a burrowing monster usually found in forests or 
choice agricultural land. Because of its fondness for fresh meat, 
the ankheg is a threat to any creature unfortunate enough to en¬ 
counter it. 

The ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged worm. Its six 
legs end in sharp hooks sui table for burrowing and grasping, and 
its powerful mandibles are capable of snapping a small tree in 
half with a single bite. A tough chitinous shell, usually brown or 
yellow, covers its entire body except for its soft pink belly The 
ankheg has glistening black eyes, a small mouth lined with tiny 
rows of chitinous teeth, and two sensitive antennae that can de¬ 
tect movement of man-sized creatures up to 300 feet away. 

Combat: The ankheg's preferred attack method is to lie 5 to 10 
feet below the surface of the ground until its antennae detect the 
approach of a victim. It then burrows up beneath the victim and 
attempts to grab him in its mandibles, crushing and grinding for 
3d6 points of damage per round while secreting acidic digestive 
enzymes to cause an additional ld4 points of damage per round 
until the victim is dissolved. The ankheg can squirt a stream of 
acidic enzymes once every six hours to a distance of 30 feet. 
However, since it is unable to digest food for six hours after it 
squirts enzymes, it uses this attack technique only when desper¬ 
ate. A victim struck by the stream of acidic enzymes suffers 8d4 
points of damage (half damage if the victim rolls a successful sav¬ 
ing throw vs. poison)* 

Habitat Society; The ankheg uses its mandibles to continuously 
dig winding tunnels 30-40 feet deep in the rich soil of forests or 
farmlands. The hollowed end of a tunnel serves as a temporary 
lair for sleeping, eating, or hibernating. When an ankheg ex¬ 
hausts the food supply in a particular forest or Held, it moves on 
to another. 

Autumn is mating season for ankhegs. After the male fertilizes 
the female, the female kills him and deposits 2d6 fertilized eggs in 
his body. Within a few weeks, about 75% of the eggs hatch and 
begin feeding. In a year, the young ankhegs resemble adults and 
can function independently. Young ankhegs have 2 Hit Dice and 
an AC 2 overall and an AC 4 for their undersides; they bite for 
ld4 points of damage twith an additional ld4 points of damage 
from enzyme secretions), and spit for 4d4 points of damage to a 
distance of 30 feet. In every* year thereafter, the ankheg functions 



with full adult capabilities and gains an additional Hit Die until it 
reaches 8 Hit Dice. 

Beginning in its second year of life, the ankheg sheds its chitin- 
ous shell just before the onset of winter. It takes the ankheg two 
days to shed its old shell and two weeks to grow a new one. Dur¬ 
ing this time, the sluggish ankheg is exceptionally vulnerable. Its 
overall AC is reduced to 5 and its underside AC is reduced to 7. 
Additionally it moves at only half its normal speed. Us mandible 
attack inflicts only IdlO points of damage, and it is unable to 
squirt acidic enzymes. While growing a new shell, it protects it¬ 
self by hiding in a deep tunnel and secreting a repulsive fluid that 
smells like rotten fruit. Though the aroma discourages most crea¬ 
tures. it can also pinpoint the ankhegs location for human 
hunters and desperately hungry predators. 

Ankhegs living in cold climates hibernate during the winter. 
Within a month after the first snowfall, the ankheg fashions a lair 
deep within the warm earth where it remains dormant until 
spring. The hibernating ankheg requires no food, subsisting in¬ 
stead on nutrients stored in its shell. The ankheg does not secrete 
aromatic fluid during this time and is thus relatively safe from 
detection. Though the ankheg's metabolism is reduced, its anten¬ 
nae remain functional, able to alert it to the approach of an in¬ 
truder, A disturbed ankheg fully awakens in Id4 rounds, after 
which time it can attack and move normally. 

The ankheg does not hoard treasure. Items that were not dis¬ 
solved by the acidic enzymes fall where they drop from the 
ankhegs mandibles and can be found scattered throughout its 
tunnel system. 

Ecology: Though a hungry ankheg can be fatal to a farmer, it 
can be quite beneficial to the farmland, Its tunnel system laces the 
soil with passages for air and water, while the ankhegs waste 
products add rich nutrients. The ankheg will eat decayed organic 
matter in the earth, but it prefers fresh meat* All but the fiercest 
predators avoid ankhegs. Dried and cured ankheg shells can be 
made into armor with an AC of 2, and its digestive enzymes can 
be used as regular acid.

The arcane are a race of merchants, found wherever there is po¬ 
tential trade in magical items. They appear as tail lanky, blue 
giants with elongated faces and thin fingers; each finger having 
one more joint than is common in most humanoid life. The ar¬ 
cane dress in robes, although there are individuals who are found 
in heavier armor, a combination of chain links with patches of 
plate (AC 3), 

Combat: For creatures of their size, the arcane are noticeably 
weak and non-combative. They can defend themselves when 
called upon, but prefer to talk and/or buy themselves out of dam 
gerous situations. If entering an area that is potentially danger¬ 
ous (like most human cities), the arcane hires a group of 
adventurers as his entourage. 

The arcane can become invisible , and can dimension door up 
to three times a day, usually with the intention of avoiding com¬ 
bat. An arcane feels no concern about abandoning his entourage 
in chancy situations. They can also use any magical items, re¬ 
gardless of the limitations of those items, This includes swords, 
wands, magical tomes, and similar items restricted to one type of 
character class. They will use such items if pressed in combat and 
they cannot escape, but more often use them as bartering tools 
with others. 

Arcane have a form of racial telepathy, such that an injury to 
one arcane is immediately known by all other arcane. The arcane 
do noL seek vengeance against the one who hurt or killed their 
fellow. They react negatively to such individuals, and dealing 
with the arcane will be next to impossible until that individual 
makes restitution. 

Habitat Society: Nothing is known about the arcane's origins: 
they come and go as they please, and are found throughout the 
known worlds. When they travel, they do so on the ships and 
vehicles of other races. Finding such ships with arcane aboard is 
rare, and it is suspected that the arcane have another way of trav¬ 
elling over Jong distances. 

Contacting the arcane is no trouble in most civilized areas: a 
few words spread through the local grapevine, through taverns, 
guilds, and barracks, are enough to bring one of these creatures 
to the surface. In game terms, there is a base 10% chance per day 



of finding an arcane, if PCs actively look for one; the chance in¬ 
creases or decreases depending on their location. Arcane never 
set up permanent “magic shops." 

The arcane s stock in trade is to provide magical items, particu¬ 
larly speltjamming helms, which allow rapid movement through 
space The arcanes' high quality and uniform (if high) prices 
make them the trusted retailers. They accept payment in gold, or 
barter for other magical items (as a rule of thumb, costs should be 
five times the XP reward of the item, or a more valuable item). 

The arcane take no responsibility for the use of the items they 
sell. The arcane will deal with almost anyone. They often make 
deals with both sides in a conflict, fully aware that they might 
annihilate all of their potential customers in a region. The arcane 
have no dealings with neogi, nor with creatures from other 
planes, such as genies, tanar ri, and fiends. It is unknown wheth¬ 
er the arcane create a wide variety of magical devices, or secure 
them from an unknown source. 

Those dealing with the arcane find them cool, efficient, and 
most importantly, uncaring. Trying to haggle with an arcane is a 
chancy business, at best. Sometimes they will engage in haggling 
with a bemused smirk, but just as often leave the buyer hanging 
and walk out on the negotiations. They do not like being threat¬ 
ened, insulted, or blackmailed. Those who do so will find it very 
difficult to purchase reliable equipment. An arcane will not raise 
his hand in vengeance or anger—there are more subtle ways to 
wreak revenge. 

Ecology: It is not known what arcane do with the gold, gems, 
and magic they collect, One theory says they need the items for 
reproduction (the basis for a large number of bawdy arcane 
jokes), while another links it to production and acquisition of 
more magical items, The arcane seem sexless. No young arcane 
have been reported, and the arcane keep their own counsel.

Argos are found in the same regions of wildspace as the baleful 
beholder nations. An argos resembles a giant amoeba. It has one 
large, central eye with a tripartite pupil, and a hundred lashless, 
inhuman eyes and many sharp-toothed mouths. An argos can ex¬ 
trude several pseudopods, each tipped with a fanged maw that 
functions as a hand to manipulate various tools. 

Argos move by slithering; they can cling to walls and ceilings. 
They can levitate and fly at the very slow rate of 3. 

Argos colors tend toward shades of transparent blues and vio* 
lets; they smell like a bouquet of flowers, They are huge beasts 
ranging in size from 10 to 20 feet in diameter, weighing about 200 
pounds per Hit Die, Though they exhibit signs of being intelligent 
tool users, they do not wear clothes, choosing rather to carry 
gear stored in temporary cavities within their bodies. However, 
their digestive juices often ruin devices within two to three weeks 
(saving throw vs. add). 

Combat; An argos can attack with one to three weapons or 
items, or it can enfold a victim in a pseudopod and attack with 
Id3 mouths for Id4 points of damage each. It may attack as 
many foes in this way as it can physically reach. 

If an argos rolls a natural 20 on an attack, it envelopes its vic¬ 
tim, swallowing him whole, A swallowed victim suffers 2d8 
points of damage each round from the creatures digestive juices. 
The victim may attempt to cut his way free from within, using 
only short cutting weapons. He must inflict 8 points of damage to 
break free. 

The eyes of an argos, like those of a beholder, have a variety of 
special powers. An argos can bring IdlO of its smaller eyes to 
bear on any target. The large, central eye can focus only on tar¬ 
gets that are in front of the creature (within 90 degrees of the 
"'straight-ahead point" of the central eye). Though the creature 
has nearly 100 eyes, only 20 special powers have been noted: 
therefore a number of eyes must possess the same power. 

Each point of damage inflicted on an argos eliminates one eye; 
the DM decides which powers are reduced in the process. It is 
possible to target one particular eye by attacking with a -4 pen¬ 
alty to the attack roll. 

Each ability of an argoss eye is treated as a spell effect. Use the 



argoss Hit Dice as the caster level* Roll ld2G and check the fol¬ 
lowing table for a particular eye's power.

Habita(/Society: Argos are solitary creatures, though it is not un¬ 
heard of to discover an argos guardian aboard an eye tyrant ship, 
Argos appear capable ot replenishing their own air envelope and 
thus may be encountered wandering asleroid rings and dust 
clouds alone* 

Despite its relative intelligence, the argos is a ravenous crea¬ 
ture driven by its hunger. It tries to lure prey into its grasp, feed¬ 
ing until it has consumed a number of creatures equal to two 
times its own Hit Dice. It then slips away to digest its meal for a 
period equal to two hours per Die. If an argos is unable to find 
food within a week of its last meal, it loses 1 Hit Die per week 
until it becomes a 5-Hit Die creature. After that point, it can hi¬ 
bernate for up to a year by crystallizing its outer shell and form¬ 
ing a chrysalis. 

Ecology; Argos consume anything that moves and is digestible. 
Their preference is to use their abilities to lure their prey into 
traps and then to pick off individuals one at a time. It sorts 
through the tools and weapons of its victims and keeps the useful 
items.

Despite being only the size of a large badger, the aurumvorax, 
or ' golden gorged' is an incredibly dangerous creature. The ani¬ 
mal is covered with coarse golden Hair and has small silver eyes 
with golden pupils, it has eight powerful legs that end in 3-inch- 
long copper daws. The aurumvoraxs shoulders are massively 
muscled while its heavy jaw is hill of coppery teeth. 

The creature weighs over 500 pounds. This incredible density 
provides the animal with much of its natural protection. This, 
combined with its speed, power, and sheer viciousness, makes it 
one of the most dangerous species yet known. 

Combat: The aurumvorax charges any creature that enters its 
territory, causing a -3 to opponents' surprise rolls if attacking 
from its den. A female of the species receives a +2 bonus to at¬ 
tack rolls when guarding her young. 

The creature bites at its prey until it hits, clamping its massive 
jaws onto the victim and doing 2 S hit points of damage. After it 
hits, the aurumvorax locks its laws and hangs on, doing an addi¬ 
tional 8 points of damage per round until either the aurumvorax 
or its enemy is dead. Only death will cause the aurumvorax to 
relax Us grip. 

Once its laws lock, the golden gorger also rakes its victim with 
2^8 of its legs, causing 2-8 hit points of damage per additional hit. 
An opponent who is held by an aurumvorax receives no dexteri¬ 
ty adjustment to Armor Class, 

Due to its incredibly dense hide and bones, the aurumvorax 
takes only half damage from blunt weapons. It is immune to the 
effects of small, normal fires and takes only half damage from 
magical fires. Neither poison nor gasses have any effect, on the 
sturdy creature. 

Habitat Society: The aurumvorax makes its solitary home in 
light forests, hills, and at the timberline on mountainsides. An 
aurumvorax chooses a likely spot and then uses its powerfully 
clawed legs to create a burrow, sometimes into solid rock. 

Due to their unusual dietary needs, aurumvorae make their 
lairs in spots that either contain rich veins of gold ore or are very 
near to an area where gold is readily available. 

The aurumvorax ss a solitary creature which jealously guards 
its territory, even from others of its kind. The only time adult 
aurumvorae willingly meet is during mating season, which oc¬ 
curs approximately every eight years, 



The pair will stay together for a week or two before the male 
returns to his territory and the female prepares for the birth of 
her kits. A litter of ld6 +2 kits is bom four months after mating. 

For the first two weeks of life, the kits are blind and hairless. 
They must be fed both meat and precious ores, including gold, in 
order to survive. It is unusual for more than 1-2 of the strongest 
kits to survive. If a kit is found and "adopted 4 ' before its eyes are 
open, it can be tamed and trained. 

Dwarves tend to dislike aurumvorae. though some communi¬ 
ties have been known to raise one or more of the beasts for use in 
sniffing out veins of ore. 

Ecology: In order to survive, the aurumvorax supplements Its 
carnivorous diet with quantities of gold. The ability to digest and 
utilize gold and other ores makes it possible for the creature to 
develop the dense fur, hide, and bones that protect it so well. 

If an aurumvorax is killed with a minimum of cutting damage 
to its hide, the hide may be turned into a garment of incredible 
strength and beauty worth 15,000-20,000 gold pieces. The gar¬ 
ment will also protect its wearer as armor, the specific Armor 
Class depending on the size of the aurumvorax. A garment with 
AC 2 weighs 50 pounds, one with AC 3 weighs 40 pounds, and 
one with AC 4 weighs 30 pounds. 

The wearer also receives a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. nor¬ 
mal fires and a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. magical fire. 

If an aurumvorax is burned in a forge, approximately 150-200 
pounds of gold are left behind. This burning process is very diffi¬ 
cult and usually takes between one and two weeks to perform. 
Of courser the hide may be removed before the creature is 
burned; if burned at the same time, the hide will provide an addi¬ 
tional 21-40 (ld20+20) pounds of gold. 

The aurumvoraxs teeth and claws are abo prized for decora¬ 
tion, and can bring up to 1 gp each on the open market.

General; The baatezu are the primary inhabitants of the Nine 
Hells, They are a strong, evil tempered race held together by an 
equally strong organization. The baatezu live in a rigid caste sys¬ 
tem where authority is derived from power and station. 

The baatezu wish to fulfil! their ancient quest to destroy the 
tanarTi, their blood enemies. The baatezu also know that by in¬ 
filtrating humans and entering their world they will gain power 
over the tanar'ri, Toward this end they constantly strive to domi¬ 
nate the Prime Material plane and its natives. 

The baatezu are divided into three groups: greater, lessen and 
least. Below are listed a few:

Pit Fiend: The most terrible baatezu of the Nine Kelts, pit fiends 
appear to be giant, winged humanoids, very much like gargoyles 
in appearance, with huge wings that wrap around their bodies 
for defense. Pit fiend's fangs are large and drip with a vile, green 
liquid. Their bodies are red and scaly, often emitting flames when 
they are angered or excited. In the rare situations they choose to 
communicate, they use telepathy. 

Combat: In physical combat, the pit fiend is capable of dealing 
out tremendous punishment, using its incredible 18/00 Strength 
( +6 damage adjustment). They can attack six times in a single 
round, dividing attacks against six different opponents. They cart 
attack with tw T o hard, scaly wing buffets for 1-4 points of damage 
per hit. Their powerful claws do 1-6 points of damage per suc¬ 
cessful attack. The bite of a pit fiend is dreadful indeed, causing 
any creature bitten to take 2-12 points of damage and receive a 
lethal dose of poison. A saving throw vs. poison is required or 
the victim dies in 1-4 rounds. The bite also infects the victim with 
a disease, 

Pit fiends can abo attack with their tail every round, inflicting 
2-8 points of damage per hit, The tail can then hold and constrict 
the victim for 2-8 points of damage per round until the victim 
makes a successful Strength check to break free. Pit fiends can 
also carry Jagged-toothed clubs which inflict 7-12 points of dam¬ 
age per hit (this replaces one claw attack). 

Once per round a pit fiend can use one of the following spell¬ 
like powers, plus those available to all baatezu: detect magic, de¬ 
tect invisibility, fireball hold person, improved invisibility 
polymorph self r produce flame , pyrotechnics, and of fire. 

They can f once per year, cast a wish spell* They may always 
gate in two lesser or one greater baatezu with a 100% chance of 
success, performing this action once per round. Once per day, a 
pit Bend can use a symbol of pain— the victim must save vs, rod, 
staff or wand or suffer a - 4 penalty on attack dice, and a -2 pen¬ 
alty to Dexterity for 2-20 rounds. 

Pit fiends regenerate 2 hit points per round and radiate a fear 
aura in a 20-foot radius (save vs. rod, staff, or wand at a-3 penal¬ 
ty or flee in panic for 1-10 rounds).

Baatezu 




Habita t Society: Pit fiends are the lords of the Nine Hells. They 
are the baatezu of the greatest power and the highest station. Pit 
fiends are found throughout the various layers of the Nine Hells, 
but are very rare on the upper layers, 

Wherever they are found, these mighty lords hold a position of 
great authority and power. They sometimes command vast le¬ 
gions consisting of dozens of complete armies, leading them into 
battle against the tanarTi. These huge forces are terrifying to be* 
hold, and any non-native of the lower planes, of less than 10 Hit 
Dice, who sees them, flees in panic for 1-3 days. Those of 10 Hit 
Dice or more must make a saving throw vs. rod, staff, or wand 
or flee in panic for 1-12 turns. 

Ecology: Pit fiends are spawned from the powerful gelugcms of 
the Nine Hells eighth layer, When those icy fiends are found 
worthy they are cast into the Pit of Flame for l f 0Gl days after 
which they emerge as pit fiends. 

Abishai: Abishai are common on the first and second layers of 
the Nine Hells, appearing much like gothic gargoyles. They are 
thin and reptilian with long, prehensile tails and great wings. 
There are three varieties of abishai. They are, in ascending order 
of station, black, green, and red. Abishai communicate with te* 
lepathy. 

Combat: In battle, the abishai strikes with formidable daws, in¬ 
flicting 1-4 points of damage per successful hit. It can also lash 
out with its flexible tail for 2-5 points of damage. Hidden in the 
end of an abishai's tad is a small stinger that infects poison on a 
successful hit, requiring a $a% F ing throw vs. poison (failure results 
in death). 

Abishai can fly into the air and dive at enemies, striking with 
both daws. Their attack roll is made with a + 2 bonus. A success¬ 
ful hit inflicts double damage. 


In addition to the powers possessed by all baatezu. an abishai 
can perform the following magical powers, one at a time, once 
per round: change self, command, produce flame, pyrotechnics * 
and scare. They can also attempt to gate 2-12 lemures (60% 
chance of success, once per day) or 1-3 abishai (30% chance of 
success, once per day)* 

AJ1 abishai are susceptible to damage from holy water. If a vial 
is splashed on it, an abishai suffers 2-8 points of damage. All 
abishai regenerate 1 hit point per melee round unless the damage 
was done by holy water or a holy magical weapon. 

Habitat Society: Abishai are voracious and evil. They delight in 
tormenting those few natives of the Nine Hells that are lower in 
power. Abishai are fond of using change self and charm person to 
tempt mortals bold enough to travel to the Nine Hells* 

Ecology: The abishai comprise the main body of many large, evil 
armies battling against the tanar’ri and intruders against the Nine 
Hells, In some cases, a red abishai may have proven himself wor¬ 
thy enough to command a force of lemures. If it is successful in 
this endeavor, the red abishai may be promoted to a higher form 
of baatezu,

The banshee or groaning spirit, is the spirit of an evil female elf— 
a very rare thing indeed. Banshee hate the living, finding their 
presence painful, and seek to harm whomever they meet. 

Banshees appear as floating, luminous phantasms of their 
former selves. Their image glows brightly at night, but is trans¬ 
parent in sunlight (60% invisible), Most banshees are old and 
withered, but a few (10%) who died young retain their former 
beauty. The hair of a groaning spirit is wild and unkempt. Her 
dress is usually tattered rags. Her face is a mask of pain and an¬ 
guish. but hatred and ire bums brightly in her eyes. Banshees fre¬ 
quently cry out in pain—hence their name. 

Combat: Banshees are formidable opponents. The mere sight 
of one causes fear, unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is 
rolled. Those who fail must flee in terror for 10 rounds and are 
50% likely to drop any items they were carrying in their hands. 

A banshees most dreaded weapon is its wail or keen. Any 
creature within 30 feet of a groaning spirit when she keens must 
roll a saving throw vs. death magic. Those who fail die immedi¬ 
ately, their face contorted in horror. Fortunately, groaning spirits 
can keen just once per day and then only at night. The touch of a 
groaning spirit causes ld8 points of damage, 

Banshees are noncorporeal and invulnerable to weapons of 
less than +1 enchantment. In addition, groaning spirits are high¬ 
ly resistant to magic (50%), They are fully immune to charm, 
sleep, and hold spells and to cold- and electricity-based attacks. 
Holy water causes 2d4 points of damage if broken upon them. 
An dispel evU spell will kill a groaning spirit. A banshee is turned 
as a ‘ special" undead, 

Banshees can sense the presence of living creatures up to five 
miles away. Any creature that remains within five miles of a 
groaning spirit lair is sure to be attacked when night falls. The 
nature of this attack varies with the victim. Beasts and less 
threatening characters are killed via a touch. Adventurers or 
demihumam are attacked by keening. Creatures powerful 
enough to withstand the groaning spirit's keen are left alone. 

When attacking adventurers, the groaning spirit attacks at 
night with her wad. If any characters save successfully she then 
retreats to her lair. Thereafter, each night, the groaning spirit re¬ 
turns to wail again, This routine is repeated until all of the vic¬ 



tims are dead or have left the groaning spirits domain, or until 
the groaning spirit is slain. 

Habitat'Society: Banshees loathe all living things and thus 
make their homes in desolate countryside or ancient ruins. There 
they hide by day when they cannot keen, and wander the sur¬ 
rounding countryside by night. The land encircling a groaning 
spirit's lair is strewn with the bones of beasts who heard the 
groaning spirit's cry. Once a groaning spirit establishes her lair 
she will remain there. 

The treasure of groaning spirits varies considerably and often 
reflects what they loved in life. Many hoard gold and fine gems. 
Other groaning spirits, particularly those that haunt their former 
homes, show finer tastes, preserving great works of art and 
sculptures, or powerful magical items. 

It is nearly impossible to distinguish the cry of a groaning spirit 
from that of a human or elf woman in pain. Many a knight gal¬ 
lant has mistaken the two sounds, and then paid for the mistake 
with his life. Banshees are exceptionally intelligent and speak nu¬ 
merous languages, including common, elvish, and other demi- 
human languages. 

Banshees occasionally use their destructive powers to seek re¬ 
venge against their former adversaries in life. 

Ecology: Banshees are a blight upon wherever they settle. They 
kill without discretion, and their only pleasure is the misfortune 
and misery of oLhers. In addition to slaying both man and beast, 
a groaning spirits keen has a powerful effect upon vegetation. 
Flowers and delicate plants wither and die and trees grow twisted 
and sickly, while hardier plants, thistles and the like, flourish. 
After a few years all that remains within five miles of a groaning 
spirit's lair is a desolate wilderness of warped trees and thorns 
mixed with the bones of those creatures that dared to cross into 
the groaning spirit's domain.

These reptilian monsters all posses a gaze that enables them to 
turn any Fleshy creature to stone; their gaze extends into the As¬ 
tral and Ethereal planes. 

Basilisk 

Although it has eight legs, its sluggish metabolism allows only a 
slow movement rate, A basilisk is usually dull brown in color, 
with a yellowish underbelly. Its eyes glow pale green. 

Combat: While it has strong, toothy jaws, the basilisks major 
weapon is its gaze. However, if its gaze is reflected, and it sees its 
own eyes, it will become petrified itself, but this requires light at 
least equal to bright torchlight and a good, smooth reflector. In 
the Astral plane its gaze kills; in the Ethereal plane it turns vic¬ 
tims into ethereal stone. These will only be seen by those in the 
Ethereal plane or who can see ethereal objects. 

Greater Basilisk 

The greater basilisk is a larger cousin of the more common reptil¬ 
ian horror, the ordinary basilisk. These monsters are typically 
used to guard treasure. 

Combat: The monster attacks by raising its upper body striking 
with sharp claws, and biting with its toothy maw. The daws car¬ 
ry Type K poison (saving throws vs. poison are made with a +4 
bonus). Its foul breath is also poisonous, and all creatures, com¬ 
ing within 5 feet of its mouth, even if just for a moment, must roll 
successful saving throws vs. poison (with a+ 2 bonus) or die 
(check each round of exposure). 

Even if a polished reflector is used under good lighting condi¬ 
tions , the chance for a greater basilisk to see its own gaze and 
become petrified is only 10%, unless the reflector is within 10 feet 
of the creature. (While its gaze weapon is effective to 50 feet, the 
creatures oddly-shaped eyes are nearsighted and it cannot see its 
own gaze unless it is within 10 feet, t 

Dracolisk 

The sages say that the dracolisk is the offspring of a rogue black 
dragon and a basilisk of the largest size. 

The result is a deep brown, dragon-1 ike monster that moves 
with relative quickness on six legs. It can fly but only for short 
periods—a turn or two at most. 


Combat; This horror can attack with its ialoned forelegs and de¬ 
liver vicious bites. Ln addition, it can spit a stream of acid 5 feet 
wide and up to 30 feet away. The acid causes 4d6 points of dam¬ 
age, half-damage if a successful saving throw vs, breath weapon 
is rolled. The dracolisk can spit up to three rimes per day. 

The eyes of a dracolisk can petrify any opponent within 20 feet 
if the monsters gaze ts met. Because its hooded eyes have nictat¬ 
ing membranes, the monster is only 10% likely to be affected by 
its own gaze. Opponents in melee with a dracolisk and seeking to 
avoid its gaze fight with a ^4 penalty to their to attack rolls.

Bats are common animals in many parts of the world. While or¬ 
dinary bats are annoying but harmless, larger varieties can be 
quite deadly. With almost 2,000 different species of bats known, 
one can find wingspans from less than two inches across to 15 
feet or more. The small body of the ordinary bat resembles a 
mouse, while the wings are formed from extra skin stretched 
across its fore limbs. The larger bats are scaled up but otherwise 
similar in appearance. 

Despite the common belief that bats are blind, nearly all 
known species have rather good eyesight, in the dark, however, 
they do not rely on their visual acuity, but navigate instead by 
echo-location. By emitting a high-pitched squeal and listening for 
it to bounce back to them, they can see" their surroundings by 
this natural form of sonar 

Combat: Ordinary bats attack only it cornered and left with no 
other option. If startled, bats tend to become frightened and con¬ 
fused. This causes them to swarm around and often fly into 
things. The typical bat swarm ends up putting out torches (3 % 
chance per bat encountered per round), confusing spell casting 
(Wisdom roll required to cast spells), inhibiting combatants' abil¬ 
ity to wield weapons (by a —2 THACO penalty), and otherwise 
getting in the way. Under ideal Flying conditions, a bat's Armor 
Class rating rises from 8 to 4. 

Habitat Society: While bats are found almost anywhere, they 
prefer warm and humid climes. Some species hibernate during 
the cold season and a few are know to migrate. Bats live in caves, 
dark buildings, or damp crevices, hanging by their toes during 
the day, and leaving at dusk to feed during the night In large, 
isolated caverns there may be thousands of bats. 

Ecology: Most bats eat fruit or insects, though some include 
small animals or fish in their diets. The rare vampire bat travels 
at night to drink the warm blood of living mammals, bul its vic¬ 
tims are rarely humans or demihumans. Care must be taken not 
to confuse the vampire bat with the Lrue vampire in this regard. 

Rot grubs and carrion crawlers are among the few creatures 


known to live in the guano on the floor of large bat-infested ca¬ 
verns, making any expeditions into such caves dangerous Indeed. 
If the noxious odor from the guano is not enough to subdue the 
hardiest of adventurers (a single Constitution check to stay con¬ 
scious), these crawling denizens are. 

Large Bat 

These creatures are large versions of the carnivorous variety of 
the ordinary bat with 3-footJong bodies and 5- to 6-foot-long 
wingspans. They dwell in dark caverns, usually underground, 
and depend on their sonar in flight to compensate for their poor 
eyesight. Only 10% of giant bats are of the more powerful l Hit 
Die variety* 

Extremely maneuverable in flight, large bats gain an Armor 
Class bonus of +3 when an opponent with a Dexterity of 13 or 
less fires a missile weapon at it* The creature must land (usually 
on its victim) to attack with its bite. The typical example of this 
species inflicts ld2 points of damage with its teeth while the larg¬ 
er does ld4 points of damage. Anyone bitten by a large bat has a 
1% chance per point of damage done to contract rabies. 

When rabies is contracted, there is a Id# + 6 day incubation 
period. Once this period has ended, the victim has 10 days to 
live. The victim cannot drink or eat anything and is overly irrita¬ 
ble. Anything from loud noises to being awakened at night can 
set the victim off (the DM determines the temper triggers). If tem¬ 
per flares, the victim must roll a Wisdom check. If the check fails, 
the rabid person attacks until he is killed or knocked uncon¬ 
scious, When a character contracts rabies, he or she dies from the 
infliction, unless cured by a wish, alter reality, limited wish, cure 
disease, or similar spell* 

Huge Bat (Mobat) 

Mobats prefer warm-blooded prey that they bite to death with 
their fangs. They have a dim and evil intelligence that gives them 
a desire for shiny objects. Because the typical mobat has a wing¬ 
span of 12 to 16 feet, they must have large areas to serve as flight 
runways. 


15 





Bat 


Because Mobats flight is so rapid and silent, their victims suf¬ 
fers 3 penalty to their surprise rolls. They can also give a pierc¬ 
ing screech that causes such great pain that victims seek to cover 
their ears rather than fight, unless a saving throw versus paraly- 
nation is successful. This screech is always used if the prey resists 
and it is effective in a 20-foot radius about the mobat. Note that 
mobile mobats have an Armor Class of 2, Under crowded flying 
conditions, their Armor Class suffers and raises to 7. When not 
in Right, mobats have an Armor Class of 10. 

Azmyth 

Azmyths live on flowers, small plants, and insects. They are soli¬ 
tary wanderers, though they do have "favorite haunts' to which 
they return. They often form partnerships with humanoids For 
mutual benefit, sometimes forming loyal friendships in the proc¬ 
ess, Azmyths have been known to accompany creatures For their 
entire lives, and then accompany the creatures' offspring. The life 
span of azmyths are presently unknow n but is believed to be over 
100 years. They are not familiars as wizards understand the term; 
no direct control can be exercised over one, except by spells. 

Azmyths have crested heads and bearded chins, white, pupil¬ 
less eyes, and leathery gray, mauve, or emerald green skin. They 
emit shrill squeaks of alarm or rage, and endearing, liquid chuck¬ 
les of delight or amusement. They communicate by telepathy 
that has a range of 60 feet and have infra vision to 90 feet. They 
can knom alignment three times per day become mutsib/e (self 
only for six rounds or less, ending when the azmyth makes a suc¬ 
cessful attack) once per day, and create silence 15 1 radius , cen¬ 
tered on themselves, once per day 

In combat, the azmyth bites for 1 point of damage and stabs 
with its powerful needle-sharp tails For ld2 points. Twice per day 
an azmyth can unleash a shocking grasp attack, transmitting 
IdS+ 6 points of electrical damage through any direct physical 
contact with another creature. This attack can be combined with 
a physical attack for cumulative damage. 

Night Hunter 

This species, know as dragazhar, is named after the adventurer 
who first domesticated one, long ago. Nocturnal on the surface, 
it is active anytime in the gloom of the underworld. It eats carri¬ 
on if it must, but usually hunts small beasts. Desperate dragazhar 
are known to attack livestock, drew, or humans. 

Night hunters swoop down to bite prey Ud4) P rake with their 
wing claws (ld2 each), and slash (Id6) or stab (3d4) with their 
dexterous, triangular-shaped, razor sharp tails. They stalk their 
prey flying low and dodging behind hillocks, ridges, trees, or 
stalactites, to attack from ambush. They have infra vision to a 
distance of 120 feet, but rarely surprise opponents, since they 
emit echoing, loon-like screams when excited* 

Night hunter lairs usually contain over 30 creatures. They typ¬ 
ically live in double-ended caves, or above ground in tall, dense 
woods. Night hunters do not tarry to eat where they feel endan¬ 
gered, so their lairs often contain treasure fallen from prey car¬ 
ried there* Night hunters roost head-down when sleeping. They 
are velvet in hue. even to their claws, and have violet, orange, or 
red eves. 

Sinister 

These mysterious jet-black creatures most closely resemble man¬ 
ta rays. They have no distinct heads and necks, and their 
powerfully-muscled wings do not show the prominent finger 



bones common Lo most bats, A natural ability of levitation al¬ 
lows them to hang motionless in midair. This unnerving appear¬ 
ance and behavior has earned them their dark name, but sinisters 
are not evil, Above ground, they prefer to hunt at night, when 
their 160 -range infravision is most effective. They eat carrion if 
no other food is available, and regularly devour flowers and seed 
pods of all sorts. 

Sinister* are both resistant to magic and adept in its use. In 
addition to their pinpoint precision levitation, they are sur¬ 
rounded at all times by a naturally-generated 5-foot-deep energy 
Rdd akin to a wall of force. This field affords no protection 
against spells or melee attacks, but missile attacks are stopped 
utterly: normal missiles are turned away, and such effects as 
magic missile and Meffs acid arrow are absorbed harmlessly. In 
addition, all sinister* can cast one hold monster (as the spell) 
once per day. They usually save this for escaping from creatures 
more powerful than themselves, but may use it when hunting* if 
ravenous* 

Curiously though they are always silent (communicating only 
with others of its kind via 20-foot-range limited telepathy), sinis¬ 
ter* love music-both vocal and instrumental* Many a bard mak¬ 
ing music at a wilderness campfire has found him or herself 
surrounded by a silent circle of Floating sinisters. Unless they are 
directly attacked, the sinisters will not molest the bard in any 
way, but may follow the source of the music, gathering night af¬ 
ter night to form a rather daunting audience, 

Sinisters are usually encountered in small groups and are 
thought to have a long life span* Their social habits and mating 
rituals are unknown.

A rather common omnivorous mammal, bears tend to avoid humans un¬ 
less provoked. Exceptions to this rule can be a most unfortunate occur¬ 
rence. 

Bears are, in generaJ, large and powerful animals which are found 
throughout the world's temperate and cooler climates. With dense fur 
protecting them from the elements and powerful daws protecting them 
from other animals, bears are the true rulers of the animal kingdom in the 
areas where they live. 

The so-called black bear actually ranges in color from black to light brown. 
It is smaller than the brown bear and the most widespread species by far. 

Combat; Although black bears are usually not aggressive, they are able 
fighters when pressed. If a black bear scores a paw hit with an IB or better 
it also hugs tor 1-8 (2d4) points of additional damage. 

Habitat.Society; All bears have excellent senses of hearing and smell 
but rather poor eyesight. The size shown Is an average for the variety and 
larger individuals will, of course, be correspondingly more powerful. 

One common misconception people hold about bears is that they hi¬ 
bernate during the winter. In fact, they sleep most of the time, but their 
metabolism does not slow down, and they often wake up and leave their 
lairs during warm spells. 

Bears live In small family groups. Female bears are very protective of 
their young, and more than one individual has been badly injured when 
taunting or playing with seemingly harmless bear cubs. 

Ecology- All of these ursoids are omnivorous, although the gigantic 
cave bear tends towards a diet of meat. 

Bears are fairly intelligent animals that can be trained to perform in a 
variety of ways, particularly if captured as cubs. Bears can thus be found 
dancing in circuses or accompanying "mountain men" in the wilderness. 

Brown Bear 

The brown bear, of which the infamous grizzly is the most well known 
variety, is a bear of very aggressive disposition. Brown bears are more 
carnivorous than their smaller cousins, the black bears. The grizzly in 
particular will often bring down large game such as deer and elk. 

Brown bears are aggressive hunters. If a brown bear scores a paw hit 
with a roll of IS or better it will also hug for 2-12 (2d&amp;) points of addi¬ 
tional damage. Brown bears will continue to fight for 1-4 melee rounds 
after reaching D to -8 hit points. At-9or fewer hit points, they arc killed 
immediately. 

Cave Bear 

Cave bears are quite aggressive, willing to attack well-armed parties 
without provocation. If a cave bear scores a paw hit with an 18 or better 


it also hugs for 2*16 (2d8) points of additional damage. Cave bears will 
continue to fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -8 hit points. At 
-9 or fewer hit points, they are killed immediately. 

Polar Bear 

These powerful swimmers feed mostly on marine animals. A paw hit of 
18 or better indicates a "hug - , which inflicts 3-18 (3d6l points of addition¬ 
al damage. These aggressive animals will Hght for 2-5 rounds after being 
brought Lo 0 to ^12 hit points, but beyond that they will die instantly

Giant beetles are similar to their more ordinary counterparts, but 
thousands of times larger—with chewing mandibles and hard 
wings that provide substantial armor protection. 

Beetles have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs, fortu¬ 
nately, the wings of a giant beetle cannot be used to fly, and in 
most cases, its six bristly legs do not enable it to move as fast as a 
fleeing man* The hard, chitinous shell of several varieties of these 
beetles are brightly colored, and sometimes have value to art col¬ 
lectors. While their shells protect beetles as well as plate mail ar¬ 
mor, it is difficult to craft armor from them, and a skilled 
alchemist would need to be brought in on the job. 

AH beetles are basically unintelligent and always hungry. They 
will feed on virtually any form of organic material including 
other sorts of beetles. They taste matter with their antennae, or 
feelers; if a substance tasted is organic, the beetle grasps it with its 
mandibles, crushes it, and eats it. Because of the thorough grind¬ 
ing of the mandibles, nothing eaten by giant beetles can be re¬ 
vived by anything short of a wish. Beetles do not hear or see well 
and rely primarily on taste and feel 

Except as noted below, giant beetles are not really social ani¬ 
mals; those that are found near each other are competitors for the 
same biological niche, not part of any family unit. 

Bombardier Beetle 

The bombardier beetle is usually found above ground in wooded 
areas. It primarily feeds on offal and carrion, gathering huge 
heaps of the stuff in which to lay its eggs. 

Combat: If it is attacked or disturbed, there is a 50% chance each 
round that it will turn its rear toward its attacker and fire off an 
SToot, spherical cloud of reeking, reddish, acidic vapor from its 
abdomen This cloud causes 3d4 points of damage per round to 
any creature within range. Furthermore, the sound caused by the 
release of the vapor has a 20% chance of stunning any creature 
with a sense of hearing within a iMoot radius, and a like chance 
for deafening any creature that was not stunned. Stunning lasts 
for 2d4 rounds, plus an additional 2d4 rounds of deafness after¬ 
wards, Deafening lasts 2d6 rounds. The giant bombardier can 
fire its vapor cloud every third round, but no more than twice in 
eight hours. 


Ecology: The bombardier action of this beetle is caused by the 
explosive mixture of two substances that are produced internally 
and combined in a third organ. If a bombardier is killed before ii 
has the opportunity to fire off both blasts, it is possible to cut the 
creature open and retrieve the chemicals. These chemicals can 
then be combined to produce a small explosive, or fire a projec¬ 
tile, with the proper equipment. 

The chemicals arc also of value to alchemists, who can use 
them in various preparations. They are worth 50 gp per dose. 

Boring Beetle 

Boring beetles ieed on rotting wood and similar organic material 
so they are usually found individually inside huge trees or 
massed in underground tunnel complexes. 

Combat: The large mandibles of the boring beetle have a power¬ 
ful bite and will inflict up to 20 points on damage to the victim. 

Habitat Society: Individually, these creatures are not much more 
intelligent than other giant beetles, but it is rumored that nests of 
them can develop a communal intelligence With a level of con¬ 
sciousness and reasoning that approximates the human brain. 
This does not mean that each beetle has the intelligence of a hu¬ 
man, but rather that, collectively, the entire nest has attained that 
level In these cases, the beetles are likely to collect treasure and 
magical items from their victims, 

Ecology: In tunnel complexes, boring beetles grow molds, slimes, 
and fungi for food, beginning their cultures on various forms of 
decaying vegetable and animal matter and wastes. 

One frequent fungi grown is the shrieker, which serves a dual 
role. Not only is the shrieker a tasty treat for the boring beetle, 
but it also functions as an alarm when visitors have entered the 
fungi farm. Boring beetles are quick to react to these alarms, dis¬ 
patching the invaders, sometimes eating them, but in any case 
gaining fresh organic matter on which to raise shrieker and other 
saprophytic plants.

Beetle, Giant 


Fite Beetle 

The smallest of the giant beetles, fire beetles are nevertheless ca¬ 
pable of delivering serious damage with their powerful mandi¬ 
bles, They are found both above and below ground, and are 
primarily nocturnal. 

Combat: Despite its name, the fire beetle has no fire attacks, rely¬ 
ing instead on its huge mandibles to inflict up to three times the 
damage of a dagger in a single attack. 

Ecology: Fire beetles have two special glands above their eyes 
and one near the back of their abdomens, These glands produce a 
luminous red glow, and for this reason they are highly prized by 
miners and adventurers. This luminosity persists for IdG days af¬ 
ter the glands are removed from the beetle, and the light shed will 
illuminate a radius of 10 feet. 

The light from these glands is "cold'—it produces no heat. 
Many mages and alchemists are eager to discover the secret of 
this cold light, which could he not only safe, but economical, 
with no parts to heat up and bum out. In theory, they say, such a 
light source could last forever. 

Rhinoceros Beetle 

This uncommon monster inhabits tropical and subtropical jun¬ 
gles, They roam the rain forests searching for fruits and vegeta¬ 
tion, and crushing anything in their path. The horn of a giant 
rhinoceros beetle extends about 6 feet. 

Combat: The mandibles of this giant beetle inflict 3d6 points of 
damage on anyone unfortunate enough to be caught by them; the 
tremendous horn is capable of causing 2d8 points of damage by 
itself. 

Ecology: The shell of this jungle dweller is often brightly colored 
or iridescent. If retrieved in one piece, these shells are valuable to 
clerics of the Egyptian pantheon, who use them as giant scarabs 
to decorate temples and other areas of worship. It is a representa¬ 
tion of this, the largest of all beetles, that serves as the holy sym¬ 
bol for derics of Apshai, the Egyptian god whose sphere of 
influence is said to include all insects. 

Stag Beetle 

These woodland beetles are very fond of grains and similar grow¬ 
ing crops, and they sometimes become great nuisances when they 
raid cultivated lands. 

Combat: Like other beetles, they have poor sight and hearing, 
but they will fight if attacked or attack if they encounter organic 
material they consider food. The giant stag beetle's two horns are 
usually not less than 8 feet long; they inflict up to 10 points of 
damage each. 

Ecology: The worst damage from a stag beetle raid is that done to 
crops: they will strip an entire farm in short order. Livestock suf¬ 
fers too, stampeding in fear and wreaking more havoc. The bee¬ 
tles may even devour livestock, if they are hungry enough. 



Water Beetle 

The giant water beetle is found only in fresh water no less than 30 
feet deep. 


Combat: Voracious eaters, these beetles prey upon virtually any 
form of animal but will eat almost anything. Slow and ponder¬ 
ous on land, they move very quickly tn water. Giant water bee¬ 
tles hunt food by scent and by feeling vibrations. 

Habitat Society: Water beetles sometimes inhabit navigable riv¬ 
ers and lakes, in which case they can cause considerable damage 
to shipping, often attacking and sinking craft to get at the tasty 
morsels inside. 

Ecology: Although they are air breathers, water beetles manage 
to stay underwater for extended periods of time by catching and 
holding a bubble of air beneath their giant wings. They will carry 
the bubble underwater, where it can be placed in a cave or some 
other cavity capable of holding an air supply.

The behir is a snake-like reptilian monster whose dozen legs al¬ 
low it to move with considerable speed and climb at Fully half its 
normal movement rate. It can fold its limbs dose to its long, nar~ 
row body and slither in snake-fashion if it desires. The head 
looks more crocodilian than snake-like, but has no difficulty in 
opening its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, the way 
a snake does. 

Behir ha ve band-like scales of great hardness. Their color rang¬ 
es from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The 
belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the 
head look dangerous enough but are actually used for preening 
the creature's scales and not for fighting. 


Combat: A behir will attack its prey by first biting and then 
looping its body around the victim and squeezing. If the latter 
attack succeeds, the victim is subject to six talon attacks next 
round. 

A behir can discharge a 20-foot long stroke of electrical energy 
once every 10 rounds This Jfghfnmg bolt will cause 24 points of 
damage unless a saving throw vs. breath weapon is made. In the 
latter case, the target takes only half damage. 

On a natural attack roll of 20 the behir swallows man-sized 
prey whole Any creature swallowed will lose l f*&gt; of ils starting 
Hit Points each round until it dies at the end of the sixth round. 
The behir will digest its meal in 12 turns, and at that time ihe 
victim is totally gone and cannot be raised from the dead. Note, 
however, that a creature swallowed can try to cut its way out of 
the behirs stomach The inner armor class of the behir is 7, but 
each round the creature is in the behir it subtracts 1 from the 
damage each of its attacks does. This subtraction is cumulative, 
so on the second melee round there is a -2, on the third a -3, and 
so on, 


H a bita t/Society: Behir are solitary creatures, meeting others of 
their kind only to mate and hatch a dutch of 1-4 eggs. The female 
guards these eggs for eight months while the male hunts for the 
pair. When the young hatch they are immediately turned out of 
the nest to fend for themselves, and the adults separate. 



Newly hatched behir are about 2 feet long, Behir grow at a rate 
of 8 feet per year until fully mature. Interestingly enough, newly 
hatched behir do not have all of their legs, having instead only six 
or eight, Additional pairs of legs grow slowly over time until the 
creature has its full complement when it reaches adulthood. 

Behir range over a territory of about 400 square miles, often 
living high up a cliff face in a cave. 

Behir are never friendly with dragonkind, and will never be 
found coexisting in the same geographical area with any type of 
dragon. If a dragon should enter a behir s territory the behir will 
do everything it can to drive the dragon out. If the behir fails in 
this task, it will move off to find a new home. A behir will never 
knowingly enter the territory of a dragon. 

Ecology: Behir are useful to mages, priests, and alchemists for a 
number of concoctions. The horns of a behir can be used to brew 
the ink necessary to inscribe a lightning boh scroll, and the sharp 
talons can likewise be used by a cleric to make the ink for a neu¬ 
tralize poison scroll. The heart of the behir is one of the more 
common ingredients for ink for a protection from poison scroll. 

As behir sometimes swallow prey whole, there is a 10% chance 
that there will be some small items of value inside the monster. 
More often than not (60%) these will be gems (10 x Q). Other¬ 
wise, there is a 30% chance that there will be from T8 pieces of 
jewelry and a 10% chance that a single small magical object of an 
indegistible nature may be found. Such objects are never found 
in a behirs lair, because the creature expels this waste and buries 
it elsewhere. 

The scales are valued for their hardness and color, and are 
worth up to 500 gp to an armorer who can use them to fashion a 
highly ornate set of scale mail armor.

The beholder is the stuff of nightmares. This creature, also called the 
Sphere of many eyes or the eye tyrant. appears as a large orb dominated 
by a central eye and a large toothy maw, has 10 smaller eyes on stalks 
sprouting from the top of the orb. Among adventurers, beholders are 
known as deadly adversaries. 

Equally deadly arc a number of variant creatures known collectively as 
beholder-kin, including radical and related creatures, and an undead va¬ 
riety. These creatures are related in manners familial and arcane to the 
'traditional" beholders, and share a number of features, including the 
deadly magical nature ni their eyes. The most extreme of these creatures 
are called beholder abominations. 

The globular body of the beholder and its kin is supported by levita¬ 
tion. allowing it to float slowly about as it wills. 

Beholders and beholder-kin are usually solitary creatures, but there are 
reports of large communities of them surviving deep beneath the earth 
and in the void between the stars, under the dominion of hive mothers. 

All beholders speak their own language, which is also understood by 
all beholder-kin. In addition, they often speak the tongues of other lawful 
evil creatures. 

Combat: The beholder has different Armor Classes for different parts of 
their body. When attacking a beholder, determine the location of the at¬ 
tack before striking (as the various Armor Classes may make a strike in 
one area, and a miss in another):

Each of the beholder s eyes, including the central one has a different func¬ 
tion. The standard smaller eyes of a beholder are as follows: 

L Charm person fas spell) 

2* Charm monster las spell) 

3, Steep (as spell, but only one target) 

4. Telekinesis (250 pound weight) 

5, flesh to stone fas spell 30-yard range) 

6. Dismfe&amp;rate (20-yard range f 
7- Fear (as wand! 

8, Sloir (as spell but only a single target) 

9. Cause serious wounds (50-yard range) 


10, Death ray (as a death spell with a single target, 40-yard range) 

The central eye produces an anfi-rntigic ray with a 140-yard range, 
which covers a 90 degree arc before the creature. No magic (Including the 
effects of the other eyes) will function within that area Spells cast in or 
passing through that zone cease to function, 

A beholder may activate the magical powers of its eyes' at will* Gener¬ 
ally, a beholder can use ld4 smaller eyes if attackers are within a 90 de¬ 
gree angle in front, ld6 if attacked from within a 180 degree angle, ld8 if 
attacked from a 270 degree arc, and all 10 eyes if attacked from ail sides. 
The central eye can be used only against attacks from the front. If at¬ 
tacked from above, the beholder can use all of the smaller eyes 
The beholder can withstand the loss of its eyestalks. each eyestalk 
smaller eye having 5-12 hit points. This loss of hit points is over and 
above any damage done to the central body. The body can withstand two 
thirds of the listed hit points in damage before the creature perishes. The 
remaining third of the listed hit points are located in the central eye, and 
destroying it will eliminate the anti-magic ray, A beholder with 45 hit 
points will have a body that will take 30 points of damage, a central eve 
that will take 15 points, while one with 75 hit points will have a body that 
will withstand 50 points of damage, and a central eye that takes 25 hil 
points to destroy. Both beholders would have smaller eyestalks/eyes that 
take 5-12 Side +4) points of damage to destroy but such damage would 
not affect the body or central eye. Slaying the body will kill the beholder 
and render the eyes powerless. Destroyed eyestalks (but not the central 
eye) can regenerate at a rate of one lost member per week, 

Habitat/Soriety: The beholders are a hateful, aggressive and avaricious 
race, attacking or dominating other races, including other beholders and 
many of the beholder-kin. This is because of a xenophobic intolerance 
among beholders that causes them to hate atl creatures not like them¬ 
selves. The basic, beholder body-type (a sphere with a moulh and a cen¬ 
tral eye, eye-tipped tentacles) allows for a great variety of beholder 
subspecies. Some have obvious differences, there are those covered with 
overlapping chitin plates, and those with smooth hides, or snake-like eye 
tentacles, and some with crustacean-Hke joints. But something as small as 
a change in hide color or size of the central eye can make two groups of 
beholders sworn enemies. Every beholder declares its own unique body- 
form to be the "true ideal" of beholder hood, the others being nothing but 
ugly copies, fit only to be eliminated. 

Beholders will normally attack immediately. If confronted with a par¬ 
ticular party there is a 50% chance they will listen to negotiations (brib¬ 
ery) before raining death upon their foes. 





Beholder and Beholder'kin 




A hit on a tentacle-mouth inflicts no damage, but stuns the tentacle, 
causing U to writhe helplessly for 1-4 rounds. If its central eye is de¬ 
stroyed, a bleeder locates beings with in 10 feet by smell and sensing vi¬ 
brations , but it is otherwise unaffected, 

TenLades must be struck with edged weapons to injure them. They can 
be tom free from the victim by a successful bend bars, lift gates roll. Such 
a forceful removal does the victim 1-6 damage per tentacle, since the 
barbed teeth are violently tom free from the tentacle. 

If an attached tentacle is damaged but not destroyed, it instantly and 
automatically drains sufficient hit points, in blood, from the victims 
body to restore it to a full 6 hit points. This reflex effect occurs after every 
non-killing hit on a tentacle, even if it is wounded more than once in a 
round. This cannot occur more than twice in one round. The parasitic 
healing effect does not respond to damage suffered by the central body or 
other tentacles, 

A tentacle continues to drain blood, if it was draining when the central 
body of the death kiss reaches 0 hit points. Tentacles not attached to a 
victim at that time are incapable of further activity. A death kiss can re¬ 
tract a draining tentacle, but voluntarily does so only when its central 
body is at 5 hit points or less; it willfully detaches once the victim has 
been drained to 0 hit points. 

Ingested blood is used to generate electrical energy—I hit point of 
blood becomes 1 charge. A death kiss uses this energy for motor activity 
and healing. An eye of terror expends one charge every two turns in mov¬ 
ing, and thus is almost constantly hunting prey. Spending one charge en¬ 
ables a bleeder to heal 1 hit point of damage to each of its 10 tentacles, its 
central body, and its eye (12 hit points in all). It can heal itself with one 
charge of stored energy every other round in addition to its normal at¬ 
tacks and activity. 

Each tentacle can store up to 24 charges of drained energy' the body 
capable of storing 50 charges of drained energy, A severed tentacle is 70% 
likely to discharge its cumulative charges, when severed, into anything 
touching it- each charge delivers 1 hit point of electrical damage. 

Finally, bleeders can ram opponents with their mass. This attack does 
1-8 damage . 

A death kiss may 'shut itself down," remaining motionless and insensi¬ 
tive on the ground, and can remain alive in that state for long periods of 
time. To awaken from its hibernation, the creature requires an influx of 


Ecology: The exact reproductive process of the beholder is unknown. The 
core racial hatred of the beholders may derive from the nature of their 
reproduction, which seems to produce identical (or nearly so} individuals 
with only slight margin for variation. Beholders may use parthenogenic 
reproduction to duplicate themselves, and give birth live (no beholder 
eggs have been found). Beholders may also (rarely) mate with types of 
beholder-kin. 

The smaller eyes of the beholder may be used to produce a potion of 
levitation, and as such can be sold for 50 gp each. 


Death KU* (beholder-kin} 

The Death Kiss, or bleeder," is a fearsome predator found in caverns or 
ruins. Its spherical body resembles that of the dreaded beholder, but the 
"eyestalks" of this creature are bloodsucking tentacles, its "eyes" are 
hook-toothed orifices. They favor a diet of humans and horses, but will 
attack anything that has blood. An older name for these creatures is eye 
of tenor. 

The central body of a death kiss has no mouth. Its central eye gives it 
120-foot infra vision, but the death kiss has no magical powers. A death 
kiss is 90% likely to be taken for a beholder when sighted. The 10 tenta¬ 
cles largely retract into the body when not needed, resembling eyestalks, 
but can lash out to a full 20-foot stretch with blinding speed, The tenta¬ 
cles may act separately or in concert, attacking a single creature or an 
entire adventuring company. 

A tentacles initial strike does 1-8 points of damage as the barb- 
mouthed tip attaches to the victim. Each attached tentacle drains 2 hit 
points worth of blood per round, beginning the round after it hits. 

Like the beholder, the death kiss has variable Armor Classes, in ordi¬ 
nary combat, use the following table, though situations may dictate other 
methods (should the creature be attacking with a tentacle from 20 feet 
away, then no attack on the body or central eye may be made, while 
attacks on the stalk and mouth are still possible),

electrical energy, considerable heal* or the internal shock caused by a 
blow, fall wound, or magical attack; any of the above stimulants must 
deal at least 5 points of damage to the death kiss to awaken it , Adventur¬ 
ers finding a hibernating death kiss usually provide such stimulation, 
thinking the sleeper helpless prey. 

Eyes of terror are solitary hunters, fully inheriting the paranoia and 
ego of their cousins, the beholders. If they encounter one of their kin, the 
result is often a mid-air struggle to the death. The loser's body becomes an 
incubator and breeding ground for the death kiss' offspring. Within one 
day. 1-4 young will "hatch"". Each new bleeder has half its parents hit 
points, and fully matures in 1 month. 

The death kiss has an organ in the central, upper body that is a valued 
ingredient in magical potions and spell inks concerned with levitation 
(and may be sold like beholder eyes}. In addition, a brain or nerve node, 
deep in a bleeder's body hardens into a soft-sided, faceted red gem upon 
the creatures death Called bloodeyes these typically fetch a market 
price of 70 gp each. They are valued for adornments since they glow more 
brightly as the wearer s emotions intensify. 

Eye of the Deep (be holder-kin I 

This is a water breathing version of the beholder, and dwells only at great 
depths, floating slowly about, stalking prey, They have two crab-Hke 
pincers which inflict 2-8 I2d41 points of damage each, and a wide mouth 
full of sharp teeth that does 1-6 points of damage. 

The primary weapons of the eyes of the deep, however,, are their eyes. 
The creatures large central eye emits a cone of blinding lig/i f 5 feet wide at 
its start, 30 feet long, and 20 feet wide at its base. Those in the cone must 
save vs. poison or be stunned for 2-8 (2d4J rounds. 

The eye of the deep also has two smaller eyes on long stalks, and uses 
both to create illusion. Acting independently, the small eyes are able to 
cast hold person and hold monster spells respectively, 

The eye of the deep has an Armor Class of 5 everywhere, including its 
eyes and eye stalks. If Us eyestalks are severed they will grow back in 
about a week. 

Gauth (beholder-kin) 

The Gauth is a relative of the beholder that feeds on magic. Its spherical 
body is 5 feet in diameter and brown in color, mottled with purple and 
gray. Located in the center of the gauth s forward hemisphere is a large 
central eye surrounded by a ring of smaller eyes that are protected by 
ridges of tough flesh. These secondary body eyes provide the creature 
with normal vision in lighted areas and infravision to 90 feet. On the un¬ 
derside is the beast's fearsome mouth with its accompanying cluster of 
Four feeding tendrils, while the top is adorned with a crown of six eye 
stalks. Attacks on the creature hit as follows;

While the gauth is similar to the beholder, its ability to feed on the 
energy of magical objects makes it even more dangerous in some ways. 

When a gauth moves into combat, it begins to glow, much as If it were 
the object of a faerie fire spell, to attract the attention of its foes. A crea¬ 
ture that meets the gaze of the central eye must roll a successful saving 
throw vs. spelt* with a ^2 penalty, or be affected as if the victim of a 
feeblemind spell. 

If a gauth chooses to bite with its great maw, the sharp fangs inflict 3d4 
points of damage. The four tendrils around the mouth can grab and hold 
victims as if they had a Strength of 18, but they can inflict no damage. 

A gauth in combat can also employ its six eye stalks. These eyes have 
the following powers: 

L Cause serious rounds {as spell, 30-foot range). 

2. Repulsion (as spell, 10-foot wide path, 40-foot range! 

3. Cone of cold (as spel I, inflicts 3d4 points of damage and has an area of 
effect 5 feet wide at the start, 50 feet long, and 20 feet wide at the base; 
this eye can be used only three times per day) 

4. Lightning holt i as spell inflicts 4d4 damage with SO' range: this power 
cart be used up to four times per day) 

5. Paralyzation (as wand. 40-foot range, single target: only a dispel mag¬ 
ic or the beholder s death can tree the victim) 

6. Dweomer drain (see below) 

Perhaps the most feared of the gauth's powers, its dweeuner drain, per¬ 


mits the gauth to drain charges from magical items. It has a 40-foot range 
and can be targeted or one individual per round. In addition to prevent¬ 
ing one object from functioning for the duration of that round, this 
power drains one charge from one charged object. Permanent objects, 
such as magical swords, are rendered powerless for one round by this 
ability. Artifacts are not affected by the dweomer drain. The eye has no 
effect on spells that have been memorised (but not yet cast) and it will not 
break the concentration of a wizard. It does neutralize any spell cast by 
its target that round, however. 

A dispel magic spell cast on any of the gauth's eye stalks prevents its 
use for Id4 rounds. The central eye, any fully retracted eye stalks, the 
body's ability to glow, and the gauth’s natural levitation are not subject 
to injury by such a spell. 

If a gauth is slain, its magical energy dissipates. Usually, this is a harm- 
less event, but there is a 2% chance that it is catastrophic* inflicting 4d4 
points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet (no saving throw), Gauth 
are immune to their own powers and to those of other gauth. They have 
an unusual physiology that enables them to regenerate 1 hit point every 
two turns. 

Although gauth are not known to fight over territories or prey, they do 
go to great lengths to avoid each other. Even when they encounter an¬ 
other of their kind in the wilderness, they often ignore them utterly* 

A gauth can survive by eating meat but it greatly prefers to devour 
magical objects. In some unknown manner, the creature is able to absorb 
magical energy and feed on it- Each turn that an object spends in the 
gauth's stomach causes it to lose one charge. A permanent object is ren¬ 
dered inoperative after one day {artifacts are not affected, nor do they 
provide sustenance). Magical objects that cannot be entirely digested by a 
gauth are spat out after they have been drained of all their power. 

Gauth are thought to live a century or so. Within a week of their "natu¬ 
ral" death, two young gauth emerge from the corpse. Although smaller 
than their parent (each has 2 +2 or 3 +3 HD and a bite that causes only 
2d4 points of damage), they have all the powers oF a full-grown adult. 

Spectator (beholder-kin) 

Another relative of the beholder, the spectator is a guardian of places and 
treasures, and capable of limited planar travel Once it is given a task* the 
spectator will watch for up to 101 years. It will allow no one to use, bor¬ 
row, or examine an item or treasure, except the one who gave it its or¬ 
ders, The spectator has a large central eye and four smaller eye stalks 
protruding from the top of its hovering, spherical body. 

The spectator is difficult to surprise, and has a +2 surprise modifier 
and a +1 initiative modifier. It is basically a passive creature* and will 
attempt to communicate and implant suggestion as its first act* unless it is 
immediately attacked. Striking a spectator has the following effects;

A spectator, if blinded in all of its eyes, cannot defend its treasure and 
will teleport to the outer plane of Nirvana. This is the only condition 
under which it will leave Us post. Its eyes regenerate in one day and then 
it returns, If the treasure is gone* the creature again leaves for Nirvana, 
never to return. 

Spectator has a general magic resistance of 5%. As long as the central 
eye Is undamaged, it can also reflect one spell cast at it, per round, send¬ 
ing it back against the caster. This does not apply to spells whose range is 
touch. Reflection occurs only if the spectator rolls a successful saving 
throw vs, spell, [f the saving throw fails, magic resistance (and a further 
saving throw) must be rolled. Reflection is possible only if the caster is 
standing within the 60 degree arc of the central eye. Only the spellcaster is 
affected by a reflected spell. 

All of the smaller eyes may be used at the same time against the same 
target, Their powers are: 

1. Create food and water (creates the amount of food and water for a 
large meal for up to six people; this takes one full round) 

2- Cause serious wounds (inflicts 2d8+3 points of damage to a single 
being at a range of 60 yards; a saving throw vs, spell is allowed for half 
damage) 

3. Partdyzafiou ray (range 90 feet, one target only, for 8d4 rounds). 

4. Telepathy (range 120 feet, only one target: communication bpossible 
in this way* and the beast can also plant a suggestion if the target fails a

saving throw vs, spells the suggestion is always to leave in peace). 

If properly met, the spectator can be quite friendly. It will tell a party 
exactly what it is guarding early in any conversation. If Its charge is not 
threatened, it can be very amiable and talkative, using its telepathy. 

Spectators move by a very rapid levitation, in any direction. They wi11 
drift aimlessly when asleep (20% likely when encountered), never touch¬ 
ing the ground. 

The treasure being guarded is 90% likely to be a magical item. If the 
spectator gains incidental treasure while performing its duty, this is not 
part of its charge and it will freely aJlow it to be taken. Incidental treasure 
can be generated as follows: 40% for 3-300 coins of mixed types. 30% for 
I d6 gems of 50 gp base value, 20 % for Id4 potions, 15 % for a +1 piece of 
armor, 15% for a +1 weapon* and 5% for a miscellaneous magical item 
valued at 1,000 XP or less, 

Spectators are summoned from Nirvana by casting monster summon¬ 
ing V with material components of three or more small eyes from a be¬ 
holder. (The chance of success is 10% per eye.) The spectator can be 
commanded only io guard some treasure. It performs no other duty, and 
if commanded to undertake some other task it returns to Nirvana imme¬ 
diately, If its guarded treasure is ever destroyed or stolen, the spectator is 
released from service and returns to Nirvana. The summoner may take 
the item with no interference from the spectator, but this releases the 
creature. 

Undead Beholder iDeath Tyrant) 

Death tyrants are rotting, mold-encrusted beholders. They may be shriv¬ 
eled, wounds exposing their internal, spherical networks oF circular ribs, 
among the remnants of their exoskeleta! plates. All sport wounds, some 
have eyestalks missing, or a milky film covering their eyes. They move 
and turn more slowly than living beholders, striking and bringing their 
eyes to bear last in any combat round. 

An undead beholder can use all the powers of its surviving eyes, just as 
it did in life. The powers of 2-5 eyes (select randomly, including the cen¬ 
tral eye) are lost due to injuries or death, and the change to undeath. 
Although a death tyrant heals'' its motive energies through time, it can¬ 
not regenerate lost eyestalks or their powers. 

Charm powers are lost in undeath. The two eyes that charmed either 
become useless (60%). or function as weak ho/d monster effects (40%), A 
being failing to save against such a hold remains held as long as the eye's 


gaze remains steadily focused on them. If the eye is turned on another 
being, or the victim hooded, or forcibly removed, the hold lasts another 
1-3 rounds. Death tyrants are immune to steep, charm and hold spells. 

If not controlled by another creature through magic, a death tyrant 
hangs motionless until its creator's instructions are fulfilled (for example, 
Attack all humans who enter this chamber until they are destroyed or 
flee. Do not leave the chamber, ). If no instructions are given to a new" 
death tyrant, it attacks all living things it perceives. Death tyrants occur 
spontaneously in very rare instances. In most cases, they are created 
through the magic of evil beings—from human mages to illithid villains. 
Some outcast, magic-using beholders have even been known to create 
death tyrants from their own unfortunate brethren. 

Death tyrants have no self-awareness or social interaction; they are 
mindless servants of more powerful masters. Mindless” is a relative 
term; the once highly intelligent brains of death tyrants still use eyes skill¬ 
fully to perceive and attack nearby foes, When a death tyrant is con¬ 
trolled by another being, consider it to have the intelligence of its 
controller 

Death tyrants are created Irom dying beholders. A spell, thought to 
have been developed by human mages in the remote past, forces a be¬ 
holder from a living to an undead state, and imprints its brain with in¬ 
structions. "Rogue death tyrants also exist; those whose instructions 
specifically enable them to ignore all controlling attempts. These are im¬ 
mune to the control attempts of all other beings, Beholders often leave 
Lhem as traps against rivals. 

Human spell researchers report that control ot a death tyrant is very 
difficult. A beholder's mind fluctuates wildly in the frequency and level of 
its mental activity scrambling normal diflmj monster and control wn- 
deact spells. A special spell must be devised to command a death tyrant. 

Saving Throws 

Most beholders make saving throws according to their Hit Dice. The 
Death Kiss makes saving throws as a lOth-Jevei warrior. The typical be¬ 
holder and undead beholders make saving throws as follows: 

Creature hit points Saves as 

45*49 IQlh level warrior 

50-59 12th level warrior 

60-69 14th level warrior

Hive Mother ibeholdef-kin) 

The legendary hive mothers are also called the "Ultimate tyrants ', or just 
“Ultinrales . They are twice the size of typical beholders, and differ in 
appearance as well 

Their mouths are larger, so large that they can gulp down a man-sized 
target on a natural die roll of 20. Once swallowed, the prey takes 5-20 
points of damage (5d4) each round unt il it is dead or escapes. The behold¬ 
ers mouth is not very deep, so a victim can escape by making a successful 
attack roll. 

The ultimate has no evestalks. but its magical eyes are protected by 
hooded covers in the flesh of the creatures body, so that they cannot be 
severed. The central eye has 15 hit points.

The ultimate s true ability is in controlling the actions of large numbers 
of beholders and beholder-kin. A hive mother may have 5-10 ordinary 
beholders under its command, or 5-20 abomination beholder-kin (see be¬ 
low), which It communicates with teiepathically. A nesting hive mother 
spells disaster for the surrounding region, as it can apparently create a 
community of beholders, beholder-kin, and abominations, tt destroyed, 
the beholders and beholder-kin will fum on each other, or seek their own 
lairs. 

Hive mothers may be the ancestral stock of the better known beholder, 
the next step of its evolution, a magical mutation, or a separate species. 
The reality remains unknown. 

Director (abominationi 

Directors are a social, warrior-beholder, and breed specialized mounts, 
They mindlink with their mounts to better control them. 

Directors resemble beholders, but their central eye is smaller. They 
possess only six small eyes on retractable eye stalks. Directors have a 
fanged mouth below the central eye and possesses three clawed, sensory 
tendrils on their ventral surface. These tendrils are used to ding to the 
mount and link with its limited mind. 

Directors' eyes have their own powers: 

1. Magic Missile (as spell , 2/round) 

2. Burning Hands (as spell at 6th level) 

3. WaJI of Ice (as spell) 

4, Slot* (as spell| 

5, Enervation (as spell) 

6, Improved Pharrrosmaf Force las spell ) 


A directors central eye has the power of deflection —all frontal attacks 
on director suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll and damage is halved, 
The director also gains a +2 bonus to all saving throw's against spells cast 
by those in the field of vision of the central eye. 

Director mounts seem to have derived from an insect stock, as they are 
covered in chitin and have simple eye spots and multiple limbs. 

Directors normally possess 8 Hit Dice, but when mounted the director 
and mount are treated as a single creature whose Hit Dice equals the sum 
of those of the director and the mount. Alter a director mount suffers 
half damage, the mount's speed is reduced to half and the director gets 
only one physical attack per round. A director may flee and leave his 
mount to tend for itself (the mount suffers a “4 penalty to its attack 
rolls). Directors have an AC of 4, but are AC 2 when mounted. Directors 
may use all of their normal powers while mounted, within the restrictions 
of beholder targeting angles, 

Crawler (a typical mount): A crawler resembles a cross between a cen¬ 
tipede and a spider. It has 4 Hit Dice. It has 10 legs, two pairs of frontal 
antennae, and two fighting spider fangs that can be used for separate 
stabbing attacks causing 2d4 points of damage each. Victims who fail to 
roll successful saving throws vs. poison are paralyzed for ld4 rounds. 
Crawlers are omnivores that prefer to eat smaller creatures. Unmounted, 
they may roll into a ball to gain an AC of 0. They have cutting mandibles 
beneath their front fangs, 

Examiner 4 j bo mi mil in in 

An examiner is a 4-foot diameter sphere with no central eye and only four 
small eyes, each at the end of an antenna, mounted atop the sphere. They 
have one smalt, lamprey-like mouth on their ventral surface. The mouth 
is surrounded by four multHointed limbs ending in gripper pads. These 
limbs can pick up and manipulate tools, the chief strength of the exam¬ 
iner. 

Examiners are scholars and clerks involved in spell and magical item 
enhancement, research, and creation. They can use any artifact or tool as 
well as humans, and they can wield up to four items at a time. Examiners 
regenerate 1 point of damage each round, The powers of their four eyes 
are given below (all speil-like effects are cast al the Sth level), 

1, Enlarge or Reduce 

2. Identify or Legend Lore 

3, Transmute Farm (similar to a Stone Shape spell, but works on all types 
of nonmagical, nonliving material) 

4. Spe/f Reflection as a nng of spell turning 

Examiners are not the bravest of beholder-kin, but they are potentially 
the most dangerous with their command of artifacts. They are often the 
lackeys of beholders, overseers, and hive mothers.

Lcnsman (abomination! 

A lensman has one eye set in the chest of its five-limbed, starfish-shaped, 
simian body. Beneath the eye is a leering, toothy maw Four of the five 
limbs end in three-fingered, two-thumbed, clawed hands. The fifth limb, 
atop the body, is a prehensile, whip-1 ike tentacle. Its chi tin is soft and 
there are many short, fly-like hairs. Lensmen are the only kin to wear any 
sort of garb—a webbing that is used to hold tools and weapons. Their 
preferred weapons are double-headed pole arms, 

Lensmen are semi-mindless drones that don’t question Ihdr lot in life.

Overseer 'abomination 

Overseers resemble fleshy trees. They have 13 limbs, each of which ends 
in a bud that conceals an eye: one of these limbs forms the top spine, and 
three yammering mouths surround the spine. There are eight thorny, 
vine-like limbs that arc used to grasp tools and for physical defense, in¬ 
flicting IdlO *2 points of damage each. Overseers sit on root-like bases 
and can inch along when movement is required. They cannot levitate, 
Overseers are covered with a fungus which changes color as the over¬ 
seers desire, commonly mottled green, gray, and brown 

Overseers may use any physical weapons or artifacts. The powers of 
their 13 eyes are as follows (all magical effects are cast at 14th level). 

1* Cone of Cold 
2 ♦ Dispel Magic 

3. Paralysis 

4, Chain Lightning 

5 Telekinesis 250 lb. weight

7\ Muss Charm 
8. Domination 
Q. Mrtss Suggestion 

10, Major Creation 

11. Spell Turning 

12. Serten s Spell Immunity 

13, Temporal Stash 

An overseers AC is 2. but each eye stalk is AC 7 and is severed if it 
suffers 10 points of damage. 

Like hive mothers (that operate with them), overseers can convince 
similar beholders and beholder-kin to work together. Overseers are very 
protective of their health and always have one or two beholder guards 
and at least a halt dozen directors protecting their welfare. 

Watcher (a bo min a lion J 

Wat chefs are 6-foot-diameter spheres with three central eyes arranged 
around the circumference of the sphere. These eyes are huge and un- 
liddcd, On the crown of the sphere is a compound eye and a ring of six 
eye spots that make it difficult to surprise a watcher, A large tentacle with 
a barbed prehensile pad extends from the ventral surface, right behind the 
small mouth with its raspdike tongue. Watchers feed on carrion and 
stunned prey. They are information gatherers and are the least brave of 
all the eye tyrant races. 

Watchers can attack with their single tentacle for 3d6 points of damage. 
The tentacle also inflicts an electrical shock; victims who fail a system 
shock roll fall unconscious. 

Each of a watchers main, eyes ha^ two powers, and the compound eye 
on top may draw on three different abilities. The six eye spots have no 
special powers. 

1. Tnie Seeing and ESP 

2. Advanced illusion and Detm-Shuripw Magic 

3. 7Wrfrme5ti 1,000 lb, and Tefeporf 
Compound Eye: Message. Tongues, and Suggestion 

Watchers are not aggressive warriors; they prefer misdirection and 
flight to actual confrontation. 


Other Beholders and Beholder-kin 

The beholder races are no! limited to the ones presented here. The plastic 
nature of the beholder race allows many mutations and abominations in 
the breed, including, but not limited to, the following. 

Beholder Mage 

Shunned by other beholders, this is a beholder which has purposely 
blinded its central eye, so that it might cast spells. It does so by channel¬ 
ing spell energy through an eyestalk, replacing the normal effect with that 
of a spell of its choice. 

Elder Orb 

These are extremely ancient beholders of godlike intelligence and power. 
Though they have lost the function of some of their eyestalks, they have 
more hit points and are able to cast spells. They can supposedly create 
and control death tyrants, 

Orbus 

This is a stunted, pale-white beholder retaining only its anti-magic eye 
and reputed to have great magical ability. 

Doomsphere 

This ghost-like undead beholder is created by magical explosions. 

Kasha rin 

An undead beholder, it passes cm the rotting disease which killed it. 

As t creator 

This abomination is a great baulder-jike beholder-kin without eyes. 
Gorbet 

The gorbel is a wild, clawed beholder-kin lacking magic but with the nas¬ 
ty habit of exploding if attacked. 

In addition, there are beholders which are in all appearances normal ’ 
but have eyes with alternate magical abilities, such as a detect he instead 
oi a death ray. Such creatures are usually treated as outcasts by all the 
beholder and beholder-kin races.

if a giant eagle dives more 

than 50 feet, it adds +4 to its attack roll 


t cresting creatures ever to evolve. Their unique physiology sets them 
apart from alt other life, and their grace and beauty have earned them a 
place of respect and adoration in the tales of many races. 

Blood Hawk 

Blood hawk hunt in Hocks and are fond of humanoids They continue to 
attack humans even if the melee has gone against them, Male blood 
hawks kill humans not only for food but also for gems, which they use to 
line their nests as an allurement to females. 


and doubles its daw damage, 

Giant eagles have exceptional eyesight and hearing and cannot be sur¬ 
prised except at night or in their lair, and then only 10% of the time. Far 
more social than normal eagles, up to 20 nests can be found in the same 
area, one nest for each mated pair. Giant eagles can be trained and their 
eggs sell for 500 to 50 0 gp. 

Eblis 

Their bodies look like those of storks, with grey, tan, or off-white plum¬ 
age on their bodies and sleek black necks. Their heads are narrow and 


Boobrie 

The boobrie, giant relative of the stork, stands 12 feet talk A boobries 
diet consists of giant catfish and other wetland denizens. When times are 
lean, the boobrie feeds on snakes, lizards, and giant spiders. Its occasion¬ 
al dependence on a diet of creatures that deliver a toxic bite has made the 
boobrie immune to all poisons. When a boobrie hunts, it finds a grove of 
tall marsh grass or similar vegetation and slips into it. Once in its hunting 
blind, it remains still for hours at a time, until prey comes within sight. 
When employing this means of ambush, its opponents suffer a “3 penal¬ 
ty to their surprise rolls. 

Condor 

Condors measure three to six feet and have a wingspan of 13 to 20 feet. 
They rarely land except Ip feed—they even sleep in flight. Condor eggs 
and hatchlings are worth 30-60 gp. They can be trained to act as spotters 
or retrievers. Humanoids of small or tiny size can train them as aerial 
mounts. Used in this way, they can carry 60 pounds, either held in their 
claws or riding atop their backs. 

Eagle 

An eagle typically attacks from great heights, letting gravity hurtle it to¬ 
ward its prey. If an eagle dives more than 100 feet, its diving speed is 
double its normal flying speed and the eagle is restricted to attacking with 
its daws. These high-speed attacks gain a +2 attack bonus and double 
damage. Eagles are never surprised because of their exceptional eyesight 
and hearing. Eagles mate for life and, since they nest in one spot, it is easy 
to identify places where eagles are normally present. On occasion, in an 
area of rich feeding, l dS + 4 eagles are encountered instead of the normal 
individual or pair Eagles generally hunt rodents, fish, and olher small 
animals. Eagles also Feed on the carrion of recently killed creatures as 
well. Eagles never attack humanoids, though small creatures like brown¬ 
ies have to be wary of a hunting eagle. 


end in long, glossy-black, needle-1 ike beaks Eblis speak a language of 
chirps, whistles, and deep-throated hoots. In addition, spellcasting eblis 
have managed to learn a rudimentary version of common, allowing ihem 
to converse with those they encounter. Each community is led by one 
individual with spellcasting ability. These eblis cast 2d4 spells per day as 
3rd-level casters. To determine the available spells, roll IdS and consult 
the following table. Duplicate rolls indicate the spell may be employed 
more than once per day.

Eblis love shiny objects (like gems); even the most wise and powerful of 
the eblis can be bribed with an impressive jewel. An eblis community 
consists of 2d4 huts built from straw and grasses common to the marsh 
around the community. Care is taken by the eblis Lo make these huts diffi¬ 
cult to detect. In fad, only a determined search of the area by a ranger or 
someone with the animal lore proficiency is likely to uncover the commu¬ 
nity. 

All eblis secrete an oil that coats their feathers and provides them with 
a + 1 bonus lo all saving throws against fire- and flame-based attacks 
Any damage caused by a fire- or flame-based attack is lessened by -1 for 
each die of damage. 

The evil nature of the eblis is best seen in the delight it takes in hunting 
and killing. When an eblis spots travelers who have objects it desires for 
its nest, it attacks. Since the eblte Is cunning, these attacks often take the 
forms of ambushes. 

Falcon 

Falcons are smaller, swifter and more maneuverable than hawks. These 
birds of prey are easily trained and are preferred by hunters over hawks. 
Trained falcons sell for around 1.000 gp each. 


Eagle, Giant 

Giant eagles stand 10 feet tall and have wing spans of up to 20 feet. They 
share the coloration and fighting methods of their smaller cousins, How-

Bird 


Flight Jess Bird 

These avian? are typified by the ostrich, emu. and rhea. Although they 
share many of the physiological adaptations that enable other birds to 
take wing and break the bonds of earth, they are unable to fly, 

The ostrich is the largest and strongest, standing 8 feet tall and weigh¬ 
ing 300 pounds. The animal's small head and short, flat beak are perched 
atop a long, featherless neck The ostrich fans is able to run at 40 miles 
per hour. If forced to fight, an ostrich uses its legs to deliver a kick that 
inflicts Ids points of damage. 

The emu reaches b feet high and 130 pounds. Unlike those of their larg¬ 
er cousins, the wings of an emu are rudimentary appendages hidden be¬ 
neath their coarse, hair-like feathers. 

The rhea resembles a small ostrich, standing 3 feet tall and weighs 80 
pounds, The differences between the I wo species lie in the structure of the 
feet and the tall feathers* Ostriches have two toes* while rheas have three, 
and ostriches have elegant, flowing tail plumes* while (he rheas are far 
shorter. Long leathers on the bird s sides swoop down to cover the stunt¬ 
ed tail feathers. 

Hawk 

Hawks have wingspans up to 5 feet. They attack in plummeting dives, 
usually from a height of 200 feel or more. This dive gives them a +2 
attack bonus, enabling their talons to inflict double damage. Hawks can¬ 
not attack with their beaks during the round in which they use a dive 
attack. After the initial dive, hawks fight by biting and pecking with their 
beaks, tearing at their opponents with their talons. Hawks target eyes 
and they have a 25% probability of striking an eye whenever its beak 
strikes Opponents struck in the eye are blinded for ldlO rounds and have 
a 10% chance of losing the use of the eye. Because of their superior eye¬ 
sight. hawks can never be surprised. Any intruder threatening the nest is 
attacked, regardless ot stee, If taken young and trained by an expert, 
hawks can be taught to hunt. Fledglings bring 500 gp and trained hawks 
sell for as much as 1,200 gp. 

Owl 

Owls hunt rodents* small lizards and insects, attacking humans only when 
frightened lor magically commanded r They have 120' in fra vision and quad¬ 
ruple normal hearing. They fly in total silence, giving their prey 4 ”b penalty 
to their surprise rolls. Owls cannot be surprised during hours of dusk and 
darkness: during daylight hours, their eye sight is worse than that of humans, 
suffering a ”3 on their surprise roll if discovered in their daylight roosting 
place. Owls attack with sharp talons and hooked beaks. If they swoop from a 
height of 50 feet or more, each attack is +2 and inflicts double damage, but 
no beak attack is possible 

Owl Giant 

These nocturnal creatures inhabit very wild areas, preying on rodents 
large game birds, and rabbits They are too large to gain swoop bonuses 
but can fly in nearly perfect silence; opponents suffer a -6 on their sur¬ 
prise roll. Giant owls may be friendly toward humans, though they are 
naturally suspicious. Parents will fight anything that threatens their 
young. Eggs sell for 1 000 sp and hatchlings sell for 2*000 sp. 

Owl Talking 

Talking owls appear as ordinary owls* but speak common and six other 
languages (PM's option), Their role is to serve and advise champions of 
good causes on dangerous quests, which they do for ld3 weeks If treated 
kindly on the first encounter: a talking owl feigns a broken wing to see 
how a party will react. Talking owls can detect good. They have a wis¬ 
dom score of 21 with the appropriate spell immunities. 

Raven ’Crow! 

Ravens and crows are often mistaken as bad omens by superstitious 
farmers and peasants. They attack with strong claws and their long, 
sharp beaks. Ravens employ a grab and peck approach to combat. These 
birds are 10% likely to attack an opponent's eyes, If successful, the attack 
causes the opponent to lose an eye. All birds of this type travel in flocks. 
Any encountered solo are actually scouts. As soon as they see any ap¬ 
proaching creature, the scouts give warning cries and maintain a safe dis¬ 
tance to keep track of them, Because of the scouts* ravens cannot be 
surprised during daylight conditions. 



Raven* Gian! 

Giant ravens are both pugnacious and easily trained (if raised from fledg¬ 
lings}* and are often used as guards and messengers. While they are too 
small to be used as mounts by all but small humanoids (he** faerie folk 
and PCs under the effects of a potion of diminution}, the strength of these 
birds is enough to carry an adult halfliftg* 

Raven* Huge 

Huge ravens have malicious dispositions, occasionally serving evil mas¬ 
ters, Mot all raven familiars and consorts are evil—the alignment of the 
master is a decisive factor in such arrangements. 

Swan 

These aquatic birds tend to inhabit areas frequented by similar water- 
fowl. Such areas include rivers* ponds* Jakes* and marshes. Swans posses 
acute senses. They are 90% likely to detect intruders. There is a 10% 
chance that any swan encounter includes one ur more swanmays (q.v J in 
avian form, 

Vulture 

Vullures are sca vengers that search the skies for injured or dead creatures 
to feed upon. They measure 2 to 3 feet long with a wingspan of up to 7 
feet* Greasy blue-black feathers cover the torso and wings; its pink head 
is bald. Vultures are cowards, and will wait until an untended meal stops 
moving. If six or more vultures are present, they may attack a weakly 
moving victim. If the victim defends itself, the vultures move out of reach 
but maintain their death watch, Creatures that are unconscious, dead, or 
magically sleeping or held are potential meals. If the surviving combat^ 
ants are further than 20 feet from the fallen creatures* the vultures alight 
and begin feeding- Because of their diet, vultures kin have developed a 
natural resistance to disease and organic toxins. 

Vulture, Giam 

Giant vultures measure 3 to 5 feet. Domesticated giant vultures can be 
trained to associate specific species (i.e*. as humanoids) with food, hence 
the birds concentrate on locating those creatures. Giant vulture eggs and 
hatchlings are worth 30-00 gp.

These small, furry animals are nearly blind, and look like normal 
moles. Brain moles are seldom seen, however, They live in un¬ 
derground tunnels, burrowing through rock as easily as through 
dirt. Usually, the only discernible evidence of a brain moles pres¬ 
ence is a network of blistered stone or mounded dirt above 
ground, which marks the tunnel complex. These creatures dam¬ 
age more than landscapes, however. Brain moles feed on psionic 
activity. From the protection of their tunnels, they will psionicaL 
ly burrow into a victim s brain, and drain his psionic energy. 

Combat; A brain mole commonly attacks its victim in forests or 
underground: in either case, the creature is usually out of its di¬ 
rect line of sight- The mole waits for a psionically endowed being 
to appear above it. or tt will burrow in search of prey. 

Brain moles have an innate psionic sense and can automati¬ 
cally detect any psionic activity within 200 yards. However, they 
can only feed on psionic energy when their victim is nearby: 
within 30 yards if the victim is a psionidst or psionic creature. 30 
feet if the victim Is a wild talent. The mole can't get a fix on its 
prey until the victim actually uses a psionic power. 

Once a brain mole locates a victim it will attempt to establish 
contact. If contact is made, U will attempt to feed. If the victim is 
a wild talent, feeding is accomplished by using mind wipe. If the 
victim is a psionidst (or psionic creature), feeding is accom¬ 
plished through amplification. 

A brain mole does not attack maliciously It must feed at least 
once a week or it will die.

drain upon psionirists or psionic creatures. However, it does not

siphoning away psionic energy 

Habitat Society: Brain moles live in family units that include one 
male, one female, and ld6 young (one of which may be old 
enough to feed by itself). Large brain mole towns of up to 3d6 
family units have been reported. Of course, these only occur in 
places frequently traveled by the psionically empowered. 

Ecology: Though brain moles can be dangerous to some, others 
keep them as pets. The moles are rather friendly, and easily 
tamed. They are favored by royalty who enjoy the special pro¬ 
tection which only brain moles can provide. Some sages claim 
that even a dead brain mole can otter protection from psionic 
attacks, provided the carcass is worn about one's neck as a me¬ 
dallion, Sometimes, nobles who have been harassed by a particu¬ 
lar psionidst will send heroes out on quests for the little furry 
rodents. 

On the open market, adult brain moles sell for 50 gp. Young¬ 
sters sell tor 5 gp each.

Broken ones (or animal men I are the tragic survivors of scientific 
and magical experiments gone awry. While they were once hu¬ 
man their beings have become mingled with those of animals 
and their very nature has been forever altered by the shock of this 
event* It is rumored that some broken ones are the result of tailed 
attempts at resurrection, reincarnation, or polymorph spells. 

While broken ones look more or less human, they are physi¬ 
cally warped and twisted by the accidents that made them. The 
characteristics of their non-human part will be clearly visible to 
any who see them. For example, a broken one who has been in¬ 
fused with the essence of a rat might have horrific feral features 
wiry whiskers, curling clawed fingers, and a long, whip-like tail 

Broken ones know whatever languages they knew as human 
beings and 10% of them can communicate with their non-human 
kin as well. If is not uncommon for the speech of a broken one to 
be heavily accented or slurred by the deformities of its body. 

Combat: Broken ones tend to be reclusive creatures and combat 
with them is rare. Still, they are strong opponents. Broken ones 
are almost always blessed with a greater than human stamina, 
reflected Ln the fact that they always have at least 5 hit points per 
Hit Die. Thus, the weakest of broken ones has at least 15 hit 
points. In addition, broken ones heal at a greatly accelerated 
rate, regenerating 1 hit point each round. 

A broken one will often wield weapons in combat, inflicting 
damage according to the weapon used. Many broken ones have 
also developed daws or great strength, which makes them deadly 
in unarmed combat. Hence, all such creatures inflict ld6 points 
of damage in melee. Unusually strong strains might receive bo¬ 
nuses to attack and damage rolls. 

Many broken ones have other abilities (night vision, keen 
hearing, etc.) that are derived from their animal half. As a gen¬ 
eral rule, each creature wdj have a single ability of this sort* 

Habitat Society: Broken ones tend to gather together in bands of 
between 10 and 60 persons. Since they seldom find acceptance in 
human societies, they seek out their own kind and dwell in se¬ 
cluded areas of dense woods or rocky wastes Far from the homes 
of men. From time to time they will attack a human village or 
caravan, either for supplies, in self-defense, or simply out of 
vengeance for real or imagined wrongs* If possible, they will try 



to seek out their creator and destroy him for the transformations 
he has brought upon them. 

When a society of these monsters is found, it will always be 
tribal in nature. There will be from 10-60 typical broken ones 
with one greater broken one for every 10 individuals. The greater 
broken ones (described below) will act as leaders and often have 
absolute power over their subjects. 

Ecology: Broken ones are unnatural combinations of men and 
animals. Their individual diets and habits are largely dictated by 
their animal natures* Thus, a broken one who has leonine char¬ 
acteristics would be carnivorous, while one infused with the es¬ 
sence of a horse would be vegetarian. There are no known 
examples of a broken one who has been formed with the essence 
of an intelligent nonhuman creature. 

Broken ones do manufacture the items they need to survive. 
These are seldom of exceptional quality, however, and are of lit¬ 
tle or no interest to outsiders. Occasionally, broken ones may be 
captured by evil wizards or sages who wish to study them. 

Greater Broken Ones 

From time to time, some animal men emerge who are physi¬ 
cally superior* While they are still horrible to look upon and can¬ 
not dwell among men, they are deadly figures with keen minds 
and powerful bodies. Their twisted and broken souls, however, 
often lead them to acts of violence against normal men . 

These creatures regenerate at twice the rate of their peers (2 hit 
points per round) and inflict Idfi points of damage in unarmed 
combat. When using weapons, they gain a +3 to +5 bonus on 
all attack and damage rolls* Like their subjects, they often have 
special abilities based on their animal natures. Such powers, 
however, are often more numerous (from 1-4 abilities) and may 
be even better than those of the animal they are drawn from. For 
example, a greater broken one who is created from scorpion 
stock might have a ckitinous shell that gives it AC 2 and it might 
have a poisonous stinger.

Brownies are small, benign humanoids who may be very distant¬ 
ly related to halflings. Peaceful and friendly brownies live in pas¬ 
toral regions, foraging and gleaning their food. 

Standing no taller than 2 feet, brownies are exceedingly nim¬ 
ble, They resemble small elves with brown hair and bright blue 
eyes. Their brightly colored garments are made from wool or lin¬ 
en with gold ornamentation. They normally carry leather 
pouches and tools for repairing leather, wood, and metal. 

Brownies speak their own language and those of elves, pixies, 
sprites, and halflings, as well as common. 

Combat: Brownies prefer not to engage in combat, and only do 
so if threatened, Angry brownies rarely meet their foes in hand to 
hand combat, relying instead on magic. 

Since their senses are so keen, it is impossible to surprise 
brownies. They are superb at blending into their surroundings 
and can become all but invisible when they choose, This, com¬ 
bined with their great agility, gives them an AC of 3. 

Brownies use spells to harass and drive away enemies. They 
can use the following spells, once per day: protection from evil, 
ventriloquism . dancing lights, continual light mirror image (3 
images), confusion, and dimension door . If cornered and unable 
to employ any spells, brownies attack with short swords. 

Habitat Society: Brownies live in rural areas, making their 
homes in small burrows or abandoned buildings. They often live 
close to or on farms, as they are fascinated by farm life. 

Brownies live by harvesting wild fruits and gleaning grain 
from a farmer's field. Being honest to the core, a brownie always 
performs some service in exchange for what is taken. One might 
milk a farmers cows and take only a small amount. 

Some brownies go so far as to become house brownies. They 
observe the families in a given area and if one meets their high 
moral standards, these brownies secretly enter the household. At 
night, while the residents are asleep, they perform a variety of 
helpful tasks: spinning, baking bread, repairing farm imple¬ 



ments, keeping foxes out of the hen house, mending clothes, and 
performing other household tasks. If a thief creeps silently into 
the house, they will make enough noise to awaken the residents. 
Watchdogs and domestic animals consider brownies friendly and 
never attack or even bark at them. 

All brownies ask in exchange for their labor is a little milk, 
some bread, and an occasional bit of fruit. Etiquette demands 
that no notice be taken of them. If the residents boast about the 
presence of a brownie, the brownie vanishes. 

Brownies are not greedy, but they do have small hoards of 
treasure which they have taken from evil monsters or received as 
gifts irom humans. A brownie sometimes leaves his treasure in a 
location where a good person in need is bound to find it. 

Strangers and outsiders are constantly watched by the brown¬ 
ies of the community until their motives are established. If the 
brownies decide that a stranger is harmless, he is left in peace. If 
not, the brownies unite and drive the intruder out. 

Brownies know every nook and cranny of the areas where they 
live, and thus make excellent guides. If asked politely, there is a 
50% chance that a brownie will agree to act as a guide. 

Ecology: Brownies are basically vegetarians who live very com¬ 
fortably on the gleanings of agricultural life. They make efficient 
use of leftovers that are too small for humans to notice. When 
brownies glean from fields, they do so after harvest, gathering 
grains and fruits which might otherwise he wasted. 

Killmoulis: The killmoulis is a distant relative of the brownie, 
standing under 1-foot in height but with a disproportionately 
large head and a prodigious nose. Killmoulis are able to blend 
into surroundings and are therefore 10% detectable. They live in 
symbiotic relationships with humans, usually where foodstuffs 
are handled, making their homes under the floors, and in the 
walls and crawlspaces.

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the 
same areas as their smaller relatives. 

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tail. Their 
hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick 
coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though 
vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the 
blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some 
savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while 
their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A 
bugbear s mouth is full of long sharp fangs. 

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same 
fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their 
name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears 
in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also 
look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous. 

The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and 
they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bug¬ 
bear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them 
infravision out to 60 feet. 

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, 
grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelli¬ 
gence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak 
the language of goblins and hobgoblins. 

Combat: Whenever possible, bugbears prefer to ambush their 
foes. They impose a -3 on others' surprise rolls. 

If a party looks dangerous, bugbear scouts will not hesitate to 
fetch reinforcements. A bugbear attack will be tactically sound, 
if not brilliant. They will hurl small weapons, such as maces, 
hammers, and spears before dosing with their foes. If they think 
they are outnumbered or overmatched, bugbears will retreat, 
preferring to live to fight another day. 



Their great strength gives them a +3 to all damage inflicted m 
melee combat. 

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief 
in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have between 28 and 30 hit 
points, an Armor Class of 3, and attack as 4 Hit Die monsters. 
Chiefs are so strong that they gain a +4 bonus to all damage 
caused in melee. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who ts iden¬ 
tical to the leaders described above. 

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who 
will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced 
into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as 
kobolds. 

The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no com¬ 
punctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, 
goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are al¬ 
so fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess. 

Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with 
the size of the group and its location. It may be several square 
miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an 
underground region. 

Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and trea¬ 
sure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will par¬ 
ley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. 
Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves. 

Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and 
weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their 
hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and am¬ 
bush. 


Habitat Society; Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in under¬ 
ground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a 
group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they 
operate equally well in daylight and darkness. 

If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered 
they will have a leader. These individuals have between 22 and 25 
hit points, an Armor Glass of 4, and attack as 4 Hit Die monsters. 


Ecology: Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and 
treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak 
and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always 
on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid 
quickly end up in the stewpot.

Aptly called a landshark, the bulette (pronounced Boo-lay) is a 
terrifying predator that lives only to eat. The bulette is univer¬ 
sally shunned, even by other monsters. 

It is rumored that the bulette ts a cross between an armadillo 
and a snapping turtle, but this is only conjecture. The bulettes 
head and hind portions are blue-brown, and they are covered 
with plates and scales ranging from gray-blue to blue-green. 
Nails and teeth are dull ivory, The area around the eyes is brown- 
black, the eyes are yellowish and the pupils are blue green. 

Combat: A bulette will attack anything it regards as edible. The 
only things that it refuses to eat are elves, and it dislikes dwarves. 
The bulette is always hungry, and is constantly roaming its terri¬ 
tory in search of food. When burrowing underground, the land- 
shark relies on vibrations to detect prey. When it senses 
something edible {Le„, senses movement), the bulette breaks to 
the surface crest first and begin its attack. The landshark has a 
temperament akin to the wolverine—stupid, mean, and fearless. 
The size, strength, and numbers of its opponents mean nothing. 
The bulette always attacks, choosing as its target the easiest or 
closest prey. When attacking, the bulette employs its large jaw 
and front feet. 

The landshark can jump up to 8 feet with blinding speed, and 
does this to escape if cornered or injured. While in the air, the 
bulette strikes with all four feet, causing 3d6 points of damage for 
each of the rear feat as well. The landshark has two vulnerable 
areas; the shell under its crest is only AC 6 (but it is only raised 
during intense combat), and the region of the bulette s eyes is AC 
4, but this is a small oval area about 8 inches across. 


Habitat Society: Fortunately for the rest of the world, the bu¬ 
lette is a solitary animal, although mated pairs (very rare) will 
share the same territory. In addition, other predators rarely share 
a territory with a landshark for fear of being eaten. The bulette 
has no lair, preferring to winder over its territory, above and be¬ 
low ground, burrowing down beneath the soil to rest. Since their 
appetites are so voracious, each landshark has a large territory 
that can range up to 30 square miles. 

Bulettes consume their victims, clothing, weapons, and all, 
and the powerful acids in the stomach quickly digest the armor, 
weapons, and magical items of their victims. They are not above 
nibbling on chests or sacks of coins either, the bulette motto be¬ 



ing eat first and think later. When everything in the territory is 
eaten, the bulette will move on in search of a new territory. The 
sole criteria for a suitable territory is the availability of food, so a 
bulette will occasionally stake out a new territory near human 
arid ha If ling territories and terrorize the residents. 

Very little is known of the life cyde of the bulette. They pre¬ 
sumably hatch from eggs, but no young have ever been found, 
though small landsharks of 6 Hit Dice have been killed. It may be 
that the bulette is hatched from very small eggs, with few young 
surviving to maturity. Still other sages theorize that the bulette 
bears live young. There is also evidence that the bulette, like carp 
and sharks, grow larger as they get older, for unusually large 
landsharks of 11 feet tall and taller have been seen. Certainly no 
one has ever come upon the carcass of a bulette that died of old 
age. 

Ecology: The bulette has a devastating effect on the ecosystem 
of any area it inhabits. Literally nothing that moves is safe from 
it—man, animal, or monster. In the process of hunting and 
roaming, the landshark will uproot trees of considerable size. In 
hilly and rocky regions, the underground movements of the bu¬ 
lette can start small landslides. Ogres, trolls, and even some gi¬ 
ants all move off in search of greener and safer pastures when a 
bulette appears. A bulette can turn a peaceful farming commu¬ 
nity into a wasteland in a few short weeks, for no sane human or 
demihuman will remain in a region where a bulette has been 
sighted. 

There is only one known benefit to the existence of the bulette: 
The large plates behind its head make superb shields, and dwar- 
ven smiths can fashion them into shields of +1 to +3 in value. 
Some also claim that the soil through which a bulette has passed 
becomes imbued with magical, rock-dissolving properties. Many 
would argue, however, that these benefits are scarcely worth the 
price.

The bullywugs are a race of bipedal, frog-like amphibians. They 
inhabit swamps, marshes, meres, or other dank places. 

Bullywugs are covered with smooth, mottled olive green hide 
that is reasonably tough, giving them a natural AC of 6. They 
can vary in size from smaller than the average human to about 
seven feet in height. Their faces resemble those of enormous 
frogs, with wide mouths and large, bulbous eyes; their feet and 
hands are webbed. Though they wear no clothing, all bullywugs 
use weapons, armor, and shields if they are available, Bullywugs 
have their own language and the more intelligent ones can speak 
a limited form of the common tongue. 

Combat; Bullywugs always attack in groups, trying to use their 
numbers to surround their enemies. Whenever they can, bully¬ 
wugs attack with their hop, which can be up to 30 feet forward 
and 15 feet upward. When attacking with a hop, bullywugs add a 
+1 bonus to thdr attack (not damage) rolls, and double the dam¬ 
age if using an impaling weapon. This skill, combined with their 
outstanding camouflage abilities, frequently puts the bullywugs 
in an ideal position for an ambush {-2 penalty to opponent's sur¬ 
prise rolls). 

Habitat/Society: More intelligent than frogs, all bullywugs live 
in organized or semi-organized socially fascist groups, cooperat¬ 
ing for the purpose of hunting and survival. They live primarily 
on fish and any other game, preferring a diet of meat. They are 
adept hunters and fisherman, and skilled in the use and construc¬ 
tion of snares and nets. 

Bullywug society is a savage one. Males are the dominant sex, 
and females exist only to lay eggs. Though females and young 
make up about one-half of any tribe, they count for little in the 
social order. The only signs of respect that bullywugs ever 
bestow are toward their leader and their bizarre frog god. The 
race is chaotic evil, and totally lacking in any higher emotions or 
feelings. 

The leader of a bullywug community is a large individual with 
8 hit points. Communities of 30 or more bullywugs have five 
subleaders (8 hp each) and a powerful leader (2 HD, 12 + hp r +1 
to damage). Communities of 60 or more bullywugs have a chief¬ 
tain G HD. 20 + hp, +2 to damage) and five subchieftains (2 
HD, 12+ hp, +1 to damage). 

All bullywugs favor dank, dark places to live, since they must 
keep their skin moist. Most bullywugs live In the open and main¬ 



tain only loose territorial boundaries. Ordinary bullywugs do 
not deal with incursions into their territory very efficiently, but 
they kill and eat interlopers if they can. They hate their large rela¬ 
tives (advanced bullywugs, see below) with a passion, and make 
war upon them at every opportunity. Bullywugs prize treasure, 
though it benefits them little. They value coins and jewels, and 
occasionally a magical item can be found amongst their hoard. 

On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and po- 
werlust seen in the individuals of other chaotic races, such as 
ores. Fighting among members of the same group, for example, is 
almost nonexistent. Some would say that this is because they 
lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite. 
The tribes are lead by the dominant male, who kills and eats the 
previous leader when it is too old to rule. This is one of the few 
instances when they fight among themselves. 

Ecology: Bullywugs tend to disrupt ecosystems, rather than fill 
a niche in them. They do not have the intelligence to harvest their 
food supplies sensibly and will fish and hunt in an area until its 
natural resources are depleted, and then move on to a new terri¬ 
tory. They hate men, and will attack them on sight, but fortu¬ 
nately prefer to dwell in isolated regions far from human beings. 

Bullywug, Advanced 

A small number of bullywugs are largeT and more intelligent than 
the rest of their kind. These bullywugs make their homes in aban¬ 
doned buildings and caves, and send out regular patrols and 
hunting parties. These groups tend to be well equipped and orga¬ 
nized, and stakeout a regular territory, which varies with the size 
of the group. They are more aggressive than their smaller cous¬ 
ins, and will fight not only other bullywugs but other monsters as 
well. The intelligent bullywugs also organize regular raids out¬ 
side their territory for food and booty, and especially prize hu¬ 
man flesh. Since they are chaotic evil, all trespassers, including 
other bullywugs, are considered threats or sources of food. 

For every 10 advanced bullywugs in a community, there is a 
10% chance of a 2ndTevel shaman being present.

The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding 
primarily upon carrion. When such food becomes scarce, how¬ 
ever, it will attack and kill living creatures h 

The crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm 
and a cephalopod* Like so many other hybrid monsters, the car¬ 
rion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by 
a mad, evil wizard. 

The monster s head, which is covered with a tough hide that 
gives it Armor Class 3, sprouts eight slender, writhing tentacles. 
The body of the carrion crawler is not well protected and has an 
armor class of only 7. The monster is accompanied by a rank, 
fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach. 

Combat: The carrion crawler can move along walls, ceilings 
and passages very quickly, using its many clawed feet for trac¬ 
tion. 

When attacking, the monster lashes out with its 2' long tenta¬ 
cles, each of which produces a sticky secretion that can paralyze 
its victims for 2-12 turns. A save versus paralyzation is allowed 
to escape these effects. They kill paralyzed creatures with their 
bite which inflicts 1-2 points of damage. The monster will always 
attack with all of its tentacles. 

Carrion crawlers are non-intelligent, and will continue to at¬ 
tack as long as any of their opponents are unparalyzed. Groups 
of crawlers attacking together will not fight in unison, but will 
each concentrate on paralyzing as many victims as they can. 
When seeking out prey they rely primarily on their keen senses 
of sight and smell. Clever travelers have been known to fool an 
approaching carrion crawler with a sight and smell illusion, thus 
gaining time to make good their escape. 


cooperate in hunting, but merely share the same space and com¬ 
pete fiercely for the same food. If 2 crawlers have made a kill or 
discovered carrion, they will often Fight over the food, some¬ 
times killing one another in the process, 

The carrion crawler mates once a year. Several days after mat¬ 
ing, the female will go off in search of a large kill. When she has 
found or killed an adequate food supply, she lays about 100 eggs 
among the carrion. The grubs hatch one week later and begin 
feeding, 

Maternal care ceases once the eggs have been laid and it is not 
uncommon for eggs to later be eaten by the female who laid 
them. Females die a few weeks after laying their eggs, exhausted 
by the effort. Males live only a short time longer, having mated 
with as many females as possible. Grubs have been known to 
consume one another in feeding frenzies, and are a favorite food 
of adult carrion crawlers. Few of the grubs reach maturity but 
those who do have eaten voraciously and will achieve their full 
size in a single year. When they reach maturity the mating cycle 
begins again. 

These monsters exist on the most basic instinctual level, having 
no more intelligence than earthworms or most insects. The carri¬ 
on crawler is driven by two urges: food and reproduction. It has 
absolutely no interest in the collection of treasure.

Habitat/Society: Carrion crawlers are much-feared denizens of 
the underground world. They live in lairs, venturing out in 
search of carrion or food every few days. Some underground in¬ 
habitants such as goblins and trolls will make use of carrion 
crawlers by leaving the bodies of dead foes out in designated ar¬ 
eas. This keeps the creatures at a good distance from their own 
homes and encourages them to “patrol" certain areas. Some ores 
have been known to chain live prisoners near the lairs of these 
fearsome monsters. 

Carrion crawlers will sometimes live with a mate or in a small 
group numbering no more than 6, This does not mean that they 


Ecology: The carrion crawler provides the same useful, if dis¬ 
agreeable, function that jackals, vultures, and crows perform, 
Like so many other predators carrion crawlers instinctively prey 
on the weak, sick, and foolish. In the long run, this has a benefi¬ 
cial effect on the prey, strengthening its gene pool. The carrion 
crawler also works wonders in over crowded caverns, quickly 
eliminating population problems among the weaker monsters. 
Thus, the life cycle of the crawler is inextricably linked to those 
of its prey—when the prey flourishes so does the crawler.

The great cats are among the most efficient of all predators. 
Cheetah 

The cheetah is a medium-si zed, lightly built cat. Its fur is sand 
colored and it is covered with dark spots. The cheetah is unique 
among cats because of its non-retractable claws. 

A skilled hunter endowed with natural camouflage, victims of 
a cheetah attack suffer a -3 on their surprise roll. They are famed 
for their tremendous bursts of speed, and can run at triple speed 
145 feet per round) for three rounds. The cat must rest 3 turns 
before sprinting again. Cheetahs can spring 10 feet upward or 20 
feet forward. If both forepaws hit during an attack the cheetah is 
able to rake for 1-2 points of damage with each of its rear daws. 
If defending their young, cheetahs receive a +2 on their attack 
and damage rolls and will fight to the death. 

Cheetahs inhabit warm plains and grasslands, often sharing 
their range with lions. Their favorite prey are the antelope that 
inhabit the plains, and they rarely attack men. Cheetahs are terri¬ 
torial but may live alone, in pairs and in groups. The female 
raises a litter of 2-4 young alone. The young,, who stay with their 
mother for as long as 2 years, can be completely trained and do¬ 
mesticated. 

The fortunes of the cheetah rise and fall with those of its prey; 
when the population of antelope and other game declines, so 
does that of the cheetah. 

jaguar 

The jaguar is a powerful cat with a deep chest and muscular 
limbs. Its color ranges from light yellow to brownish red, and it is 
covered with dark spots. 

The jaguar will attack anything that it perceives as a threat. It 
relies on stealth to dose with its prey often pouncing from 
above. The jaguar can leap 30' to attack. If both of its forepaws 


strike it will rake with its two rear daws for 2-5 Ud4 + 1) points 
of damage each. 



36 






Cat, Great 


The jaguar inhabits jungles, spending a great deal of time in tree 
tops. It climbs, swims, and stalks superbly. Jaguars are solitary and 
territorial, meeting only to mate. If found in a lair, there is a 75% 
chance there will be 1-3 cubs. Cubs do not fight effectively, 

Their strength and ferocity make jaguars one of the most 
feared predators of the jungle. 

Leopard 

The leopard is a graceful cat with a long body and relatively 
short legs. Its color varies from buff to tawny, and its spots are 
rosette shaped. 

Leopards prefer to leap on their prey imposing a -3 on the sur¬ 
prise rolls of their victims. Leopards can spring upward 20 feet or 
ahead 25 feet. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, they 
rake with their rear claws for 1-4 points each. 

Leopards are solitary, inhabiting warm deserts, forest, plains, 
and mountains. They hunt both day and night preying on ani¬ 
mals up to the size of large antelopes. They swim and climb well, 
and will often sit in treetops sunning themselves. Leopards will 
also drag their prey to safety in the treetops to devour in peace. 
The female bears 1-3 young, and cares for them for up to two 
years. If found in the lair, there is a 25 % chance that there will be 
cubs there. The young have no effective attack. 

A skilled predator, the leopard is often threatened by human 
incursions. In areas where it is hunted, it is nocturnal. 

Lion 

Among the largest and most powerful of the great cats, lions 
have yellow or golden brown fur, The males are distinguished by 
their flowing manes. 

Both male and female lions are fierce fighters. Lions hum in 
prides, with females doing most of the actual hunting. Since their 
senses are so keen, lions can only be surprised on a 1. All lions 
cart leap as far as 30 feet. Males have an Armor Class of 5 in their 
forequarters and 6 in their hindquarters while females are Armor 
Class 6 in all areas. If a lion hits with both forepaws, it can rake 
with Us rear claws doing 2-7 points damage each. 

Lions prefer warmer dimates, thriving in deserts, jungles, 
grasslands, and swamps. They live and hunt in prides, and are 
extremely territorial A pride usually consists of 1-3 males and 1- 
10 females. Lions frequently kill animals the size of zebras or gi¬ 
raffes, Lionesses will cooperate when hunting, driving their prey 
into an ambush. They have been known to attack domestic live¬ 
stock, but will almost never attack men. A lair will contain from 
1-10 cubs which are 30%-60% grown. Cubs are unable to fight. 
Lions are poor climbers and dislike swimming. 

Lions flourish only when the supply of game is adequate. Their 
size and strength have made them a favorite target of human 
hunters. 

Mountain Lion 

Not a true lion, this brownish cat is lankier than its large cousins. 
Except for their size, males and females are difficult to tell apart. 

The mountain lion is more cautious and less aggressive than its 
larger relatives. They can spring upward 15 feet or ahead 20 feet 
to attack or retreat. If they score hits with both of their forepaws, 
they will rake with their back ones for 1-4 points of damage each. 
It will not attack men unless threatened. 

Mountain lions range in warm and temperate mountains, for¬ 
ests, swamps, and plains. They are solitary, with males and fe¬ 
males each maintaining separate territories. Their favorite prey 
are deer. The female rears 2-4 cubs alone, which remain with her 
for 1-2 years. 

The mountain lion is flexible and elusive. It is adept at surviv¬ 
ing on the fringes of human civilization- 


spotted Lion 

Spotted lions are large, fierce, dappled versions of the lion. They 
are generally found in the plains of the Pleistocene epoch, and 
rarely occur elsewhere. 

Giant Lynx 

The giant lynx is distinguished by its tufted ears and cheeks, 
short bobbed tail, and dappled coloring. It has a compact muscu¬ 
lar body, with heavy legs and unusually large paws. 

The giant lynx is the most intelligent of the great cats and uses 
its wits in combat. When hiding, a giant lynx will avoid detection 
90% of the time. The lynx tan leap up to 15 feet and imposes a -6 
on the surprise rolls of its prey It has a 75% chance of detecting 
traps. If a giant lynx strikes with both forepaws, it attempts a 
rear claw rake, causing 1-3 points of damage per claw\ The giant 
lynx almost never attacks men. 

The giant lynx prefers cold coniferous and scrub forests. They 
can communicate in their own language with others of its kind, 
which greatly increases its chances of survival The nocturnal 
lynx stalks or ambushes its prey, catching rodents, young deer, 
grouse, and other smalt game. The cubs remain with their mother 
for 6 months. 

The giant lynx has all the advantages of the great cats plus the 
added bonus of a high intelligence which makes it even more 
adaptable. 

Ttger 

The tiger is the largest and most feared of the great cats. Tigers 
have reddish-o range fur and dark vertical stripes. 

A tiger is a redoubtable foe in battle and is surprised only on a 
1. They are experts in stalking and often hunt in pairs or groups. 
They can leap 10 feet upward, and spring forward 30 feet to 50 
feet to attack. If they strike successfully with both forepaws, 
their rear daws rake for 2-8 (2d4j points of damage per claw. 

This species ranges from the subarctic to the tropics, generally 
inhabiting wooded or covered terrain. Tigers are nocturnal, soli¬ 
tary, graceful climbers and swimmers who are capable of sus¬ 
tained high speed. These animals rarely fight among themselves, 
but will protect their territories ferociously They are also the 
most unpredictable and dangerous of the great cats, not hesitat¬ 
ing to attack men. Their favorite prey includes cattle, wild pigs 
and deer, females raise their 1-3 cubs alone. The cubs remain 
with their mother for several years. Lf encountered in the lair, 
there is a 25% chance that the cubs will be present. 

Feared by men, tigers are hunted aggressively and axe threat¬ 
ened by the destruction of forests. In the untamed wilderness, 
however, the tiger occupies the top predatory niche. 

Smtfodoti 

Although not truly a member of the cat family the so-called 
sabre-toothed tiger is similar to them in many ways. Smilodons 
are known for their 6 inches long fangs which are capable of in¬ 
flicting terrible wounds. Their powerful jaws and large teeth give 
them a +2 on their attack rolls. They are similar to normal tigers 
but are found only during the Pleistocene epoch.

Cats of different sizes and colorations are common throughout 
the world. Some are pets, while many are wild. 

Combat: Cats are efficient hunters, moving with grace and 
stealth; opponents suffer a “3 penalty on surprise rolls. A cat's 
excellent senses and agility allows it to be surprised only on a 1 or 
2. Its senses also allow it to hunt efficiently at night. 

Cats attack with their claws and teeth; if they hit with front 
claws, they rake with rear daws. A domestic cat's daws and rake 
each count as only one attack, rather than one per daw. 

Cats have retractable claws which can be extended for dimb- 
ing or drawn in for speed. They are agile climbers and can scale 
or move in trees at half normal movement rate. They can leap 
great distances to avoid obstacles or spring onto prey. 

Habitat/Sodety: Cats are common in settled regions. Many cul¬ 
tures keep them as pets, and they can be found in the homes of 
nobles and peasants alike. Some societies worship cats as divine 
beings, while other nations fear and hate them as the minions of 
evil. 

Ecology: Cats are commonly used to control rodent populations, 
though some hunters use them to recover downed birds and oth¬ 
er small prey. 

Domestic Cal 

There are many breeds of domestic cat, all of which share basic 
characteristics, differing only in outward appearance. An aver¬ 
age adult cat weighs eight to ten pounds, though some pampered 
specimens can weigh as much as 25 pounds* 

Cats seldom attack creatures larger than themselves, though 
they will defend themselves. They often chase and kill mice, 
birds, rats, and other small creatures. A domestic cat is capable 
of a burst of speed, boosting its movement rate to 18 for a round 
and maintaining such speed for IdlO rounds. 

A well-treated cat will live for 15 years or more. The cats ges¬ 
tation period is about two months, with ld4 + l kittens in each 
litter. Kittens are weaned when about eight weeks old. Mother 
cats will fight to the death to defend kittens. 


Wild Cat 

Wild cats are very similar to domestic cats, and some were pets 
that went feral. Generally, wild cats are tougher, stronger, and 
more capable hunters than domestic cats. 

Elven Cat 

Cats kept by elves have evolved into magical creatures, possibly 
aided by arcane means. They are very intelligent and have their 
own language, and many can speak a crude form of the elven 
tongue. Some live with gnomes, brownies, or woodland crea¬ 
tures* and also speak a basic form of their keepers 1 language. 
Most have gray-brown fur with dark stripes. 

Elven cats are very stealthy, imposing a -5 penalty to oppo¬ 
nents' surprise rolls. They are surprised only on a 1. Elven cats 
have a 99.9% chance to move silently, and a 90% chance to hide 
in wilderness areas. They are excellent climbers, can leap 20 feet 
with ease, and enjoy swimming and playing in water. 

Elven cats have magical abilities that they use to avoid ene¬ 
mies. They have limited ESP which is used to determine intent. 
They can use enlarge and trip once per day and reduce and free 
twice per day; for magical abilities, elven cats are treated as 9 th- 
level spellcasters. Enlarge doubles an elven cat's Hit Dice and 
damage; tree allows it to assume the form of a trees limb.

The catoblepas is a bizarre, loathsome creature that inhabits dis¬ 
mal swamps and marshes. Its most terrifying features are its large 
bloodshot eyes, from which emanate a deadly ray 

The body of the catoblepas is like that of a large, bloated buf¬ 
falo, and its legs are stumpy Like those of a pygmy elephant or a 
hippopotamus. Its long, snakey tail is swift and strong, and can 
move with blinding speed* The head of the catoblepas is perched 
upon a long, weak neck, and would be much like that of a wart- 
hog except that the catoblepas is uglier. 

Combat; In combat, the catoblepas relies on two forms of at¬ 
tack. 

First , it will use its strong, snaky tail to strike and stun its foes. 
Anyone struck by the tail suffers 1-6 points of damage and has a 
base 75% chance of being stunned for 1-10 melee rounds. The 
base chance of being stunned is lowered by 5% for every level 
above first, or for each additional Hit Die in the case of monsters 
and animals. 

Despite the danger of a tail strike, the catoblepas' second mode 
of attack is by far the more fearsome of the two. The gaze of the 
catoblepas emanates a deathray , with a 60 yard range. Any crea¬ 
ture meeting its gaze dies without a saving throw. If a party is 
surprised by a catoblepas, there is a 1 in 6 chance that someone in 
the group has met the creature s gaze. Those who close their eyes 
or act with their eyes averted can still be affected by the 
deathmy, but a saving throw vs. death magic is allowed. 

Since the neck of the creature is very weak, it has only a 25% 
chance of raising its head and using the death my on subsequent 
rounds. If the catoblepas and its target are both relatively still, this 
increases by 15% per melee round. If the catoblepas is forced to fol¬ 
low quick motions it has only a 10% chance of raising its head. 

If more than one catoblepas is attacking, the monsters will co¬ 
operate with one another, attempting to herd their targets into a 
crossfire. 

Habitat Society: For the most part, the catoblepas is a mean¬ 
dering creature that wanders about its swamp nibbling on marsh 
grasses and the like. Once a month, usually under the light of the 
full moon, the catoblepas seeks out meat to round out its diet. It 
is at this time that the catoblepas is most likely to be encountered 
by adventurers. 


The lair of the catoblepas is usually some sort of sheltered 
place where the ground is firm. More often than not it is sur¬ 
rounded by a tall stand of reeds or other marsh plants. The crea¬ 
ture has little fear of being disturbed in its lain since it is 
frequently the most feared carnivore in the swamp. 

The catoblepas mates for life and when more than one catoble¬ 
pas is encountered they will be a mated pair. There is a 10% 
chance that the couple will have a single offspring with them. An 
immature catoblepas will have half the Hit Dice of an adult. It 
takes almost nine years for the offspring to reach youthful matu¬ 
rity and an adult female will bear but one child every 10 or 12 
years. Both the male and the female will cooperate in raising the 
offspring. 

When the catoblepas ventures forth to hunt it eats fish* marsh 
birds, eels, water rats, large amphibians, snakes, and other 
swamp animals. The catoblepas usually stuns its prey with its tail 
and then kills it with its gaze. 

The catoblepas is an opportunistic predator when it hunts and 
it is not above eating carrion. Since it is semi-intelligent r it will 
treat parties of humans with respect, preferring to size them up 
first. As a rule* it will not attack unless it is hunting or feels that 
its mate or offspring is threatened. Being long-lived (150 to 200 
years or so) and semi-intelligent, the catoblepas is capable of 
learning from the mistakes of earlier encounters and hunts. 

The catoblepas has no special interest in wealth, and the listed 
treasure type is the result of victorious encounters with intruders. 
It attaches no value to the coins, gems* and occasional magical 
items strewn about the lair. 

Ecology: The catoblepas has no natural enemies, since its gaze 
provides it with more than adequate protection from even the 
fiercest of predators.

The cave fisher is a large insectoid that has adapted to life below 
ground. It combines many of the characteristics of a spider and a 
lobster. 

The cave fisher has a hard, chitmous shell of overlapping 
plates and eight kgs. The b rear legs are used for movement and 
traction on stony walls and corridors. Because of these limbs, the 
fisher has no difficulty in moving up and down vertical walls. 
The front pair of legs are equipped with powerful pincers, which 
are used for killing and dismembering prey. The most unusual 
feature of the cave fisher is its long snout, which can fire a strong, 
adhesive filament. The monster can also use its adhesive to an¬ 
chor itself in place on walls and ledges. 

Combat: The cave fisher has two wavs of hunting. Its preferred 
method is to string its long filament in the vicinity of its lair. The 
filaments are thin and strong, making them exceedingly difficult 
to detect or cut. There is only a 20% chance of noticing the 
strand at 10', and no chance at all of seeing them at a greater 
distance, A detect snares and pits spell will reveal a strand. The 
filament is coated with an adhesive which can only be dissolved 
by liquids with a high alcohol content (such as the cave fishers 
blood)- The filaments can only be cut by ^1 or better edged 
weapons. 

The fisher's: favorite food are small, flying creatures like bats. 
Ever opportunistic, they are constantly trying to vary their diet 
by trapping a careless adventurer, foolish goblin, or ore (provid¬ 
ed that they think that they can get away with it), If more than 
one fisher inhabits a lair, they will frequently pool their resources 
to catch larger prey. Once the victim is trapped in the filament, 
the cave fisher draws its prey in- reeling its filament in like a fish¬ 
ing line. 

Should a tempting target escape the monster s neatly laid traps, 
the cave fisher will try another mode of attack. It will spend one 
round drawing its filament in and then shoot it at the prey, slrik* 
ing as a 6 Hit Die monster. It will try to snare its prey in this 
manner so long as it remains within the fisher's established terri¬ 
tory, If the prey is hit by the filament, the monster can pull a 
weight of up to 400 pounds at a movement rate of 15' per round. 
In the event that a “tug of war ’ breaks out, the fisher has a 
strength of IS 00 with its strand. 

Habital/Sodety: Cave fishers prefer living on ledges and caves lo¬ 
cated above well-traveled paths- sharing their lairs with others of 



their kind. No more than four cave fishers will be found in one lair. 
Their filaments are always strung before their lair, and they attempt 
to kill anything they trap, often storing food for future use. 

Their territories are very small, and never larger than about 
300 feet to either side of the lair. Anything man-sized or smaller is 
considered fair game by the cave fisher and haffUngs are thought 
to be tasty treats. A single cave fisher would never attack a large, 
well armed party for the sake of a single meal. Still, they are cun¬ 
ning, and a group of the monsters might reel in their filaments 
and attempt an ambush if they thought they could get away with 
it. If hunting in one area becomes scarce, the cave fisher will sim¬ 
ply find a new area to hunt, where the small game is more plenti¬ 
ful and careless. 

Like all predators, the cave fisher is interested in survival. This 
means a steady supply of food and a mate. Females lay eggs in 
the vicinity of the lair, which they protect from predators. The 
young scatter when the eggs hatch, seeking lairs of their own. 

Although the cave fisher does not collect treasure, its lair is 
often strewn with the possessions of its former victims. 

Ecology: The cave fisher preys primarily on small flying game, 
and in the subterranean world this frequently means a diet of 
bats. It is not the top predator in its ecological niche, and has 
learned caution in dealing with other monsters. The cave fisher is 
sufficiently intelligent to know the dangers of preying on large, 
well-organized groups, who might grow tired of its depredations 
and hunt it to extinction. The monster instinctively picks the 
easiest route for survival, and relies on stealth and cunning to 
trap its prey and avoid being eaten itself. 

The filaments of the cave fisher are highly prized by many 
thieves guilds, for they can be made into thin and very strong 
rope which is nearly invisible. The filaments are wound onto 
reels and then specially treated to dilute the adhesive. The result¬ 
ing strands are made into ropes, while the diluted adhesive is 
turned into a special solution, which when applied to gloves and 
boots, greatly increases traction for climbing.

Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men. 
They dwell in remote, secluded glades and pastures. 

The appearance of a centaur is unmistakable: they have the 
upper torso, arms, and head of a human being and the lower 
body of a large, powerful horse, 

Centaurs speak their own language and some among them 
(about 10%) can converse in the tongue of elves. 

Combat: A band of centaurs is always armed, and the leaders 
carry shields. Half ot the centaurs will be wielding oaken clubs 
(the equivalent of morning stars), one quarter will carry compos¬ 
ite bows and have 10-30 arrows (either flight or sheaf, depending 
on the current state of affairs in the area). The remainder of the 
band will be leaders (AC4; HD5) using medium shields and medi¬ 
um horse lances. Centaurs make 3 attacks each round in melee; 
once with their weapons and twice with their hooves. 

Habitat/Sodety: Centaurs are sociable creatures, taking great 
pleasure in the society of others of their kind. Their overall orga¬ 
nization is tribal, with a tribe divided into family groups living 
together in harmony. The size of the tribe varies, it range from 3- 
4 families to upwards of 20 families. Since males have the danger¬ 
ous roles of hunter and protector, females outnumber males by 
two to one. The centaur mates for life, and the entire tribe partic¬ 
ipates in the education of the young. 

The lair is located deep within a forest, and consists of a large, 
hidden glade and pasture with a good supply of running water. 
Depending upon the climate, the lair may contain huts or lean- 
tos to shelter the individual families. Centaurs are skilled in hor¬ 
ticulture, and have been known to cultivate useful plants in the 
vicinity of their lair. In dangerous, monster infested areas, cen¬ 
taurs will sometimes plant a thick barrier of tough thorn bushes 
around their lair and even set traps and snares. In the open area, 
away from the trees, are hearths for cooking and warmth. If en¬ 
countered in their lair H there will be 1-6 additional males, females 
equal to twice the number of males, and 3-30 young. The females 
(3 Hit Dice) and the young (1-3 Hit Dice) will right only with their 
hooves, and only in a life or death situation. 

Each tribe will have a priest who is treated as a leader but has 
the spell abilities of a 3rd level druid. 



Centaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fish¬ 
ing, agriculture and trade. Though they shun dealings with hu¬ 
mans, centaurs have been known to trade with elves, especially 
for food and wine, The elves are paid from the group treasury, 
which comes from the booty of slain monsters. 

The territory of a centaur tribe varies with its size and the na¬ 
ture of the area it inhabits. Centaurs are also not above sharing a 
territory with elves. The attitude of a centaur toward a stranger 
in its territory will vary with the visitor. Humans and dwarves 
will usually be asked to leave in a polite manner, while halflings 
or gnomes will be tolerated, and elves will be welcomed. Mon¬ 
sters will be dead with in a manner according to the threat they 
represent to the welfare and survival of the tribe. Were a giant or 
dragon to enter the territory, the centaurs would pull up stakes 
and relocate, while trolls and ores and their like will be killed. 
Centaurs will take the treasure of their fallen foes , and are fully 
aware of its value. Most male centaurs have a small coin supply, 
while the tribe has a treasury which may well include some magi¬ 
cal items. Leaders will have twice the normal individual treasure. 
This treasure is used to buy food tor the group, or to ransom 
(90% likely) captured or threatened members of the tribe, 

While basically neutral or chaotic good, centaurs have been 
known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when under 
the influence of alcohol. They are also extremely protective of 
their females and young. Centaurs are basically pastoral, but will 
react with violence if their lifestyle and survival is threatened. 

Ecology: The centaur lives in dose harmony with nature and 
spends its lifetime carefully conserving the natural resources 
around its lair. The race seems to have an innate knowledge of 
how to achieve this precious balance. If forced to chop down a 
tree, a centaur will plant another to replace it, Centaurs never 
over hunt or over fish an area as a human group might do, but 
choose their game with care, limiting the amount they eat.

Giant centipedes are loathsome, crawling arthropods that amuse al¬ 
most universal disgust from all intelligent creatures {even other mon¬ 
sters). They are endemic to most regions. 

One of the things that makes the centipede so repulsive is its resem¬ 
blance to the worm. Its long body is divided into many segments 
from which protrude many tiny feet. Hence the name "centipede' (or 
hundred-footed I. The giant centipede is so named because it is over 
1-toot tong. The body is plated with a chitinous shell and it moves 
with a slight undulating motion. The creature has the added benefit 
of protective coloration, and varies in color depending on the terrain 
it inhabits. Those that favor rocky areas are gray, those that live un¬ 
derground are black, while centipedes of the forest are brown or red. 

Combat: When hunting, centipedes use their natural coloration to re¬ 
main unseen until they can drop on their prey from above or crawl 
out of hiding in pursuit of food. They attack by biting their toes and 
injecting a paralytic poison. The poison can paralyze a victim for 2d6 
hours, but is so weak that victims are permitted a +4 bonus to their 
saving throw'. Due to its small size, the giant centipede is less likely to 
resist attacks and receives a - 1 penalty to all its saving throws, Al¬ 
though a single giant centipede rarely constitutes a serious threat to a 
man, these creatures frequently travel in groups. When more than 
one centipede is encountered, the monsters will fight independently, 
even to the point of fighting among themselves over fallen victims. 

Habitat Society: The centipede behaves like most other insects, rov¬ 
ing from place to place in search of food; it has no set territory or 
dwelling. The centipede simply goes where its hunger leads it. It is an 
aggressive and hungry carnivore that must eat at least once a day to 
survive Hungry centipedes often resort to cannibalism. 

Ecology: Giant centipedes have several natural advantages, including 
poison and protective coloration, allowing them to compete with 
other small predators for game. Their poison bestows a certain im¬ 
munity from being hunted, but hungry and skilled animals such as 
coyotes and large predatory birds hunt them effectively in lean times. 

Their preferred targets are small mammals that are easily over¬ 
come by their weak poison. If they are very hungry, however, they 
have been known to attack anything that moves, including humans. 

Huge Centipedes 

These are identical to giant centipedes save that they are only 6 inch¬ 
es long , Their poison is weaker than that of their larger cousins and a 
failed saving throw will immobilize the victim for only ld6 hours. 
Huge centipedes make their own saving throws at “2. Mice and oth¬ 
er large insects are the favorite prey of huge centipedes. They in turn 
are hunted by giant centipedes. 


Megalo-centipede 

The mega I o-centipede, because of its great size, is no longer classed 
as an irritant but is a threat to human and animal alike. Its acidic 
poison is far more potent than that of its weaker cousins. The victims 
of a m eg a J o-ee n t i pede bite receive no bonuses on their saving throws 
and failure indicates death. If the target successfully resists the poi¬ 
son, the acid burns the victim's skin, inflicting 2d4 points of damage. 

The megalo-centipede is more intelligent than its smaller cousins 
and it is a far more cunning hunter, although they still do not cooper¬ 
ate with each other, In the wilderness the megalo-centipede prey on 
animals the size of deer. In the subterranean environment, it attacks 
man-sized or smaller creatures, including ores, goblins, or humans. 
The megalo-centipede receives no penalties to its own saving throws. 

Tunnel Worm 

This cousin of the giant centipede feeds upon and lays its eggs in car¬ 
rion, A tunnel worm attacks by lunging out of its hidden burrow to 
strike with a +2 bonus to the attack roil. Success indicates the turmel 
worm has seized its prey in its mandibles, but no damage is inflicted 
until the worm chews through the victim s armor. It takes one round 
for the worm to chew through leather or worse, two rounds for ar¬ 
mor tougher than leather but no tougher than chain mail, and three 
rounds for armor tougher than chain mail. Once the armor is 
breached, the worm automatically inflicts 2dB points of damage each 
round. If the worm suffers 15 or more points of fire damage or loses 
60% of its hit points, it drops its victim and retreats to its lain Tunnel 
worm lairs often have treasure from earlier victims.

How chimerae were created is a dark mystery better left unex¬ 
plored. The chimera has the hindquarters of a large, black goat 
and the forequarters of a huge, tawny lion. Its body has 
brownish-black wings like those of a dragon. 

The monster has three heads, those of a goat, a lion, and a 
fierce dragon. The goal head is pitch black, with glowing amber 
eyes and Jong ochre horns. The lion head is framed by a brown 
mane and has green eyes. The dragon head is covered with or¬ 
ange scales and has black eyes. 

The chimera speaks a limited form of Lhe foul language of red 
dragons. As a rule, however, it will only pause to communicate 
with those creatures who are more powerful than itself. 

Combat; Its many heads and powerful physique make the chi¬ 
mera a deadly foe in combat. The monster prefers to surprise its 
victims, often swooping down upon them from the sky. It can 
attack 6 times each round, clawing with its forelegs, goring with 
its two horns, and biting with its lion and dragon heads. If it de¬ 
sires to do so, the dragon head can loose a stream of flame some 5 
yards long in lieu of biting. The dragons fire causes 3-24 (3d8) 
points damage, although a saving throw vs, breath weapon will 
cut the damage in half. The chimera will always attempt to 
breathe if k&amp; opponents are in range. If more than 1 chimera is 
encountered, they will attack in concert. 

The armor classes are split as follows; Dragon, AC 2 (flank); 
Lion, AC 5 (front); Goat, AC 6 (rear). 

Habitat Society: The chimera, being a hybrid, combines the 
preferences of the lion, the goat, and the dragon In its habitat, 
society and ecology. The dragonish part of its nature gives the 
chimera a distinct preference for caves as lairs. The dragon and 
lion parts seem to war with one another, for some chimerae are 
dragon-like in their preference for solitude, while others live in 
small prides. Even if they mate, offspring are rare. 

The monster is an omnivore. The goat head will browse on the 
toughest plants and shrubs and will derive nutrition from the 
most barren vegetation while the lion and dragon heads can only 
be satisfied with flesh. The chimera hunts once every 3 or 4 days 
using its strength and limited intelligence to gain an advantage 



over those it preys on. Having a voracious appetite, it sometimes 
roams over territories as large as 20 square miles. 

Being chaotic evil in nature, the chimera enjoys preying upon 
men, elves, dwarves, and half lings. It will even gladly attack oth¬ 
er monsters in its search for food. Anyone entering its territory 
becomes prey, and will be treated accordingly, 

The chimera cannot resist attacking groups of travelers or 
monsters for another reason: its dragon nature craves the trea¬ 
sure that its prey might be carrying. Although it has no earthly 
use for it, the chimera will gather the coins of its fallen foe into a 
heap and roost on it like a dragon. Its hoard is nothing like that 
of a true dragon, however, and consists mainly of copper and 
silver coins, with perhaps some jewelry and a few magical items. 

Ecology: The chimera fills the role of both omnivore and a top 
predator in its ecosystem. It is very adaptable, During times 
when its prey is scarce or non-existent, the chimera can make do 
with a vegetarian diet, 

The Gorgimera 

The gorgimera has the hindquarters of a gorgon, forequarters of 
a lion, and body and wings of a red dragon. Like the chimera, it 
has the heads of its three constituent creatures. 

The monster can attack with its claws, bite with its lion and 
dragon heads, and butt with its gorgon head. In place of making 
its normal attack, the gorgon and dragon heads can employ their 
breath weapons. While the dragon s attack is similar to that of 
the chimera, the gorgons breath causes petrification to any 
caught in its area of effect. The gorgon head can use its breath 
weapon twice per day to strike in a cone 3 feet long which is 1 
foot wide at its base and 3 feet wide at its mouth. The gorgimera 
will always use one of its breath weapons if its foes are within 10 
feet. A save vs. petrification will allow a victim to avoid the ef¬ 
fects of the gorgon's breath. 

The gorgon s head can see into both the Astral and Ethereal 
planes, and its breath weapon extends therein, 

like its relative the chimera, the gorgimera can also speak a 
limited form of the language of red dragons.

Cloakers are fiendish horrors, related to trappers, that dwell in 
dark places far beneath the surface of the earth, They generally 
seek to kill those who enter their lairs, unless they can think up 
some other, more amusing way to punish interlopers. 

When a cloaker is first seen, it is almost impossible to distin¬ 
guish this monster from a common black cloak. The monsters 
back has two rows of black eye spots running down it that look 
much like buttons, and the two ivory-colored daws on its upper 
edge can easily be mistaken for bone clasps. 

When it unfurls itself and moves to attack, however, its true 
nature becomes all too obvious. At this point, its white underside 
is dear and the monster s face is fully visible. This face, with ihe 
glow of its two piercing, red eyes and the needle-like fangs that 
line its mouth, is a truly horrible sight. At this point, the monster 
also uncurls the whip-like tail at its trailing edge and begins to 
swish it back and forth in anticipation. 

Combat: When a cloaker strikes at its victim, it moves with 
blinding speed. Without warning, the cloaker flies at its target 
and, if the attack roll is successful, engulfs its prey within its 
folds. Any creature that falls victim to this attack is all but help¬ 
less and can be bitten easily (no roll required) for ld4 points of 
damage plus the victim's unadjusted Armor Class. Thus, an ad¬ 
venturer in chain mail (AC 5) suffers ld4 + 5 points of damage 
each round. Shields offer no protection from such attacks. 

While it is devouring its chosen victim, the cloaker uses its two 
whip-Hke tail attacks to inflict ldo points of damage on those 
who move in to help rescue the captive. The tail is AC 1 and can 
be cut off tf a total of 16 points of damage are inflicted upon it. 

Any attacks made on the cloaker inflict half their damage to 
the cloaker and the other half to the trapped victim. Area effect 
spells, such as fireball cause full damage to both the monster and 
its victim 

The cloaker can also emit a special subsonic moan of increas¬ 
ing intensities. Although this power is blocked by stone or other 
dense materials, it can be very effective in an open chamber. 
Cloakers may not moan and bite during the same round, A 
cloaker may emit one of four types of moan each round. 

The first intensity of moaning causes unease and numbs the 
minds of those within 80 feet of the cloaker. The immediate effect 
of this moan is to cause a - 2 penalty to the victims' attack and 
damage rolls against the cloaker. Further, any creature that is 
forced to listen to the moan for six consecutive rounds is tempo¬ 



rarily forced into a trance that renders it unable to attack or de¬ 
fend itself as long as the moaning continues. 

The second intensity of moaning acts as a fear spell. All crea¬ 
tures within 30 feet of the doaker must roll a successful saving 
throw vs. spell or flee in terror for two rounds. 

The third intensity of moaning causes nausea and weakness 
and affects all those in a cone 30 feet long and 20 feet wide at its 
open end. Anyone caught in this area must roll a successful sav¬ 
ing throw vs, poison or be overcome by nausea and weakness for 
ld4+l rounds. During Lhis time, those who fail their saving 
throws are unable to act in any manner. 

The fourth and final in tensity of moaning acts as a hold person 
spell. This power can be used on only one person at a time, has a 
range of 30 feet, and lasts for five rounds. 

Each of the various effects of the cloakers moan can be defeat¬ 
ed by the use of a neutralize poison spell on a victim. 

Goakers also have the power to manipulate shadows. Known 
as shadow shifting, this power can be used in a number of ways, 
but in only one particular manner at any given time. The cloaker 
can employ its shadow shifting ability to obscure its opponents' 
vision, thus bettering its Armor Class to 1. Or the creature can 
produce predse images from the shadows that can be used to 
trick its adversaries. One common means of employing these im¬ 
ages is to create a duplicate of the cloaker to draw away enemy 
attacks. 11 this method of shadow shifting is employed, it can be 
treated as a mirror image spell that creates ld4 +2 images, 

A %/j! spell cast directly at a specific cloaker blinds it and pre¬ 
vents it from using its shadow shifting powers. 

Habitat/Society: The thought processes of cloakers are utterly 
alien to most other life forms. As such, they can only be commu¬ 
nicated with by mages who have devoted long hours to training 
their minds in the arcane discipline necessary to understand these 
creatures. 

Ecology: It is believed that cloakers are asexual, although no 
definitive proof of this has ever been found.

The cockatrice is an eerie, repulsive hybrid ot lizard, cock, and 
bat . It is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone, 

The cockatrice is about the size of a large goose or turkey, and 
has the head and body of a cock, with two bat-like wings and the 
long tail of a lizard tipped with a few feathers. Its feathers are 
golden brown, its beak yellow, its tail green, and its wings gray* 
The cockatrice's wattles, comb, and eyes are bright red. 

Females, which are much rarer than males, differ only in that 
they have no wattles or comb. 

Combat: The cockatrice will fiercely attack anything, human 
or otherwise, which it deems a threat to itself or its lair. When 
attacking, the cockatrice will attempt to grapple with its foe, 
touching exposed flesh and turning il to stone. Flocks oi cocka¬ 
trices will do their utmost to overwhelm and confuse their oppo¬ 
nents, and they will sometimes fly directly into their victims 
faces. 

While the fatal touch of a cockatrice's beak will affect victims 
clothed in leather or fabric, it will not work through metal armor. 
The touch will, however, extend into the ethereal plane. The 
cockatrice is somewhat aware of the limits of its powers, and nat¬ 
ural selection has taught it to strike only at exposed flesh* If large 
areas of the opponent's flesh are exposed, it should be assumed 
that the cockatrice automatically touches flesh. If the target is 
reasonably well armored, the base chance of a cockatrice striking 
an area which it can affect is equal to 10% times the adjusted 
Armor Glass of the victim . 

Ha bit at Society: The cockatrice b immune to the petrification 
powers of others of its kind. 

The diet of the cockatrice consists of insects, small lizards and 
the like. When it hunts these animals, the creature does not em¬ 
ploy its power to petrify living things* 

It is distinguished from other avians by its unusual habits and nas¬ 
ty temperament. Since females are rare, they are the dominant sex, 
and will often have more than one mate, in fact, males will often 
fight or Strut for the privilege of joining a females harem. These mat¬ 
ed groups usually build their nesis in caves. Nest sites are perma¬ 
nent, and the cockatrice constantly seeks to decorate its nesting site 
by lining it with shining objects like coins and gems. 



Females lay 1 or 2 brownish red, rust speckled eggs per month* 
There is only a 25% chance that any given egg will hatch. Those 
that are fertile will hatch in 11*19 days. The young reach matu¬ 
rity and full power within 6 monLhs. Once they achieve adult¬ 
hood. the hatchlings are driven away from the nesting site by 
their parents, larger groups of cockatrices encountered will fre¬ 
quently be young driven from the nest who have temporarily 
united for survival. 

Ecology: The cockatrice thrives in the wilderness. Its petrifica¬ 
tion power makes it immune to most predators, and enables it to 
compete with other birds for food. The feathers of the cockatrice 
are prized by certain wizards as many magical scrolls must be 
inscribed with pens made from such quilb. Many people also 
seek unhatched eggs, or even a live cockatrice, as unusual pets or 
guardians. 

Pyrofbk 

Frequently mistaken for its less malignant relative, the pyrolisk is 
virtually identical to the cockatrice except for the single red 
feather in its tail and Lhe reddish cast of its wrings. Whereas the 
cockatrice is motivated by instinct alone, the pyrolisk revels in 
spreading mayhem. Any victims who fail to save vs* death magic 
when meeting its gaze will instantly burst Into flames, dying in 
agony. If the save is made, they are still burnt for 2-13 (ldl2 + 1) 
points of damage. Any creature innately or magically immune to 
fire will not be affected by its gaze, and anyone who makes their 
saving throw is thereafter immune to the gaze of lhaL particular 
pyrolisk. 

The creature can cause any fire source within 30 yards to ex¬ 
plode in fireworks (as a pyrotechnics spell) once per round. 

The pyrolisk is itself immune to all fire-based spells and at¬ 
tacks. 

The pyrolisk's mortal enemy is the phoenix, although any crea¬ 
ture which the monster encounters is likely to be attacked.

The couatl are feathered serpents of myth and lore. It is believed 
that they are distant relatives of dragons, although this remains 
unproven. 

So rare as to be considered almost legendary; the couatl is one 
of the most beautiful creatures in existence, it has the body of a 
long serpent and feathered wings the color of the rainbow. Since 
it has the ability to polymorph, the couatl will sometimes appear 
in the form of other creatures (always of good alignment). 

Couatl are able to communicate via telepathy with almost any 
intelligent creature which they encounter. In addition, they can 
speak common and most serpent and avian languages, 

Combat; A couatl will seldom attack without provocation, 
though it will always attack evildoers caught red-handed. When¬ 
ever possible, a couatl will attack from the air. 

Since it is highly intelligent, the couatl will frequently use its 
spells from a distance before dosing with its foes, if more than 
one couatl is involved, they will discuss their strategy before a 
battle. The couatl will also not hesitate to polymorph into an¬ 
other, more effective form in combat. 

The couatl have a variety of abilities which make them more 
than a match for most other creatures. In addition to being able 
to polymorph themselves at will, a couatl can use magic. Fully 
45% will be 5th level wizards, while 35% can act as 7th level 
priests. The remaining 20% are able to use both types of abilities. 

In addition to their other magical abilities, couatl can render 
themselves and up to 450 pounds of additional matter ethereal at 
will. Further, they can detect good/evil, detect magic, turn in risi¬ 
ble, and employ ESP whenever they desire to do so. The oldest 
and most powerful of couatl can also use a ptone shift on them¬ 
selves and up to 8 others. This ability has a 90% chance of reach¬ 
ing the desired plane. 

The couatl uses its poisonous bite and constriction when forced 
into melee combat. When it bites it does 1-3 points of damage and 
injects a deadly toxin. If the victim fails a save vs. poison it is killed 
instantly. If the constriction attack succeeds, the victim takes 2-8 
points damage each round until it or the couatl is killed. 



Habitat/Society: This winged serpent is native to warm, jungle¬ 
like regions but can also be found flying through the ether. Their 
intelligence and goodness have made them objects of reverence 
by the natives of the regions which they inhabit. Considered to 
be divine, there are many legends in which the couatl is the bene¬ 
factor of mankind and the bestower of such precious gifts as agri¬ 
culture and medicine. There are even shrines in certain areas 
dedicated to the couatl, and any who attack or harm a couatl are 
automatically viewed as the blackest of villains. 

Although solitary in nature, couatl think of themselves as a 
single, extended clan. This dan is led by the oldest and wisest of 
their numbers but assembles only in dire emergencies. 

Most couatl dwell alone, making their lairs in caves and aban¬ 
doned buildings in remote, uninhabited regions. They hunt jun¬ 
gle animals for food once every fortnight or so. Many enjoy 
traveling, often undertaking long journeys of exploration. 

On rare occasions, a pair will mate for life and establish a joint 
lair. Unlike many other repHles, the couatl bear live young. 
Births are rare, averaging only one per couple each century. Both 
parents participate in the rearing and education of the single off¬ 
spring, and will fight to the death if their child is threatened. 
Young couatl reach maturity in thirty or forty years and, though 
some will elect to remain with their parents for as long as a centu¬ 
ry, will eventually set off in search of the couatl's never-ending 
quest for wisdom, 

Intellectually curious, all couatl have vast stores of informa¬ 
tion and enjoy learning more. When one of them learns some 
new and fascinating fact he will inevitably set out in search of his 
brethren to share and discuss it, 

Couatl can sometimes be persuaded to help good adventurers 
or give sound council. If they feel that they are being sought for 
frivolous reasons, they will simply fly away. They are not greedy 
and do not seek treasure for its own sake. Aid from a couatl may 
well take the form of a magical item from its hoard. 

Ecology; The couatl usually reigns supreme in its jungle, hav¬ 
ing little to fear from most other monsters.

Crabmen are man-sized intelligent crabs. They walk upright on 
two pairs of legs. The small pincers tipping Lhe short arms above 
their legs are used for fine manipulation. The two longer arms 
end in large daws, Two slender eyestalks bob above the beak¬ 
like collection of mandibles which makes up the crabmans 
mouth. Male crabmen are often brightly colored and females 
may be reddish-brown, green, or black, 

Combat; Though generally peaceful, crabmen will fight back 
with their large claws if attacked, causing ld6 points of damage 
per hit* Males of certain subspecies have an enlarged daw on 
one side which does ld8 damage. Crabmen have never been 
known to wield weapons, 

If severed, a crabmans limbs and eyestalks will grow back in 
1-4 weeks. 

At certain times, population pressure and food shortages will 
cause crabmen to voraciously hunt other creatures. Most such 
attacks are directed towards other tribes ol crabmen or other 
coastal inhabitants. However, they will occasionally raid 
coastal towns for food, attacking anything that moves. Such 
savage frenzies last only a few days, during which the crab man 
population is generally reduced back to a tolerable level, 

Habitat;Society: Crabmen live as simple hunter-gatherers, sub¬ 
sisting primarily on carrion and algae, Much of each crabman s 
day is spent hunting, filtering algae, or scavenging along the 
shore. Crab man often gather large amounts of sand into their 
mouths, suck out all the organic material, and spit out fist-sized 
pellets of sand and dirt* These hardened pellets betray the pres¬ 
ence of a nearby crab man lair. 

Crabmen generally live in coastal caves* Some tribes dig ex¬ 
tensive burrows in seaside cliffs. Within a burrow complex, 
each crab man has an individual lair, situated near a large, cen¬ 
tral meeting area. 

Males and females are found in approximately equal numbers 
in a tribe. They mate at irregular times throughout the year. The 
female produces about 100 eggs within two weeks* They are laid 
in the ocean where they hatch into clear soft-shelled, crablike 
larvae. In six months they molt, develop a stronger shell, and 
begin to dwell on land. The eggs and larvae are delicious, and 
predators greatly reduce their numbers before they reach adult¬ 
hood. Larvae are almost defenseless, with AC 8, I HD and 
weak daws which do only 1-2 points of damage per hit. 



Crabmen continue to grow and molt throughout their lives, 
and specimens as tall as 10 feet have been reported. A crabman 
can live for up to 20 years, 

A crabman tribe seldom has commerce with other tribes, and 
almost never with other intelligent races. They produce few arti¬ 
facts, primarily seaweed weavings, driftwood carvings, and 
seashell constructions. Though these are often impermanent, 
some are quite beautiful. Though details of crabman religion are 
unknown, most artifacts are believed to be religious in nature, 
and are jealously guarded. 

Each tribe appears to be led by a dominant, elder male or fe¬ 
male* These leaders have maximum hit points, but are otherwise 
unremarkable. 

Crabmen speak their own language, which consists mostly of 
hisses and clicks. The crabmcn's xenophobia and the extreme 
difficulty of their language make it virtually impossible for hu¬ 
mans and similar races to learn to speak the crabman tongue. 
Those few sages who know anything about the language know 
only a few basic words. 

Crabmen are attracted to shiny metal, particularly silver- 
colored metal, though they seem unable to differentiate between 
silver, platinum, and steel, Crabman lairs often contain piles of 
these metals, with many pieces worked into sculptures. If the 
metal has rusted or tarnished, it is sometimes scraped to reveal 
the shine again, but often simply thrown into a refuse pile. 

Ecology: Crabman artifacts can sometimes bring good prices 
from collectors, though they are often fragile, and readily de¬ 
compose if made of plants. 

Crabmen are rumored to be very tasty, especially their legs 
and claws. Primitive coastal inhabitants, particularly sahuagin, 
consider them a delicacy and often raid crabman villages. Their 
shells dry out and become brittle soon after they are removed or 
molted, so they cannot be used as armor. The daws can be used 
as passable clubs.

The much feared crawling claw is frequently employed as a 
guardian by those mages and priests who have learned the secret 
of its creation. 

No single description of a crawling daw is possible as they are 
not uniform in appearance. Since daws are the animated remains 
of hands or paws of living creatures, they are apt to be found in a 
wide variety of shapes and sizes. 

Combat: When a daw detects a potential victim, it leaps to the 
attack. Although it may not appear to be capable of such a feat, 
its great strength enables it to do so. The maximum distance a 
daw can leap is 15 feet. 

Once a daw lands on its victim, it attacks in one of two ways. 
If the victim is wearing metal armor, the daw delivers a powerful 
blow that inflicts Id4 points of damage. Against those who are 
not armored (or only wearing leather! the daw can employ its 
great strength in a crushing grip. This manner of attack causes 
ld6 points of damage. 

In some cases, a claw may be instructed to attempt to strangle 
or gouge out the eyes of a victim. In any such case, the DM 
should consider all aspects of the situation and determine how 
much, if any, damage is done. 

Claws are immune to any form of death magic or raise dead 
spells, although a resurrection spell renders them immobile for a 
number of turns equal to the level of the caster. Claws have the 
same resistance to charm, sleep, and hold spells that undead do, 
but daws are not subject to turning, control undead spells, or 
damage by holy water. Cold-based spells make daws brittle so 
that all rolls to damage them are increased by 1 point per die. 

Edged weapons inflict only half damage on a daw; all magical 
weapons cause damage as if they were not enchanted in any way 
(although to hit bonuses still apply), 

Society/Hjbitat; Crawling claws are nothing more than the ani¬ 
mated hands and paws of once-living creatures. As such, they 
have no culture or society to speak of. Despite this, crawling 
claws do have a limited ability to communicate with each other. 
This takes the form of a basic telepathic link between all the 
daws of a single batch," Whenever one daw T finds a victim, all of 



the others in the area who were made at the same time move in to 
help it. 

In addition, daws that have been instructed to do so can act m 
concert with each other to move large objects. The DM should 
use five pounds per daw as a reasonable limit to the weight that 
can be moved, 

Ecology: Crawling daws can be created by any mage or priest 
who has knowledge of the techniques required to do so. To begin 
with, the creator must assemble the severed limbs that arc to ani¬ 
mated. The maximum number of claws that can be created at any 
one time is equal to the level of the person enchanting them. The 
hands (or paws) can be either fresh, skeletal, or at any stage of 
decomposition in between. 

Claws can be controlled in one of two wavs: directly or via 
programming. The manner of a claw's control must be specified 
when it is created and cannot be changed thereafter. All of the 
claws in a particular batch must be controlled in the same 
manner. 

Programmed claws are given a single, brief instruction that 
they attempt to carry out to the best of their ability. The maxi- 
mum length of the programming, in words, is 15 plus the level of 
the creator. This programming sets the conditions under which 
the daw attack. A sample command might be: Kill anyone ex¬ 
cept me who opens this chest. 

Directly controlled daws are manipulated by the thoughts of 
their creator. The mental effort of controlling daws is quite tiring 
and cannot be maintained for more than three consecutive 
rounds without a one-round rest. Further, the range of such con¬ 
trol is limited to 10 feet plus 5 feet per level of the creator. A per¬ 
son controlling claws cannot undertake spellcasting or any other 
activity. Injury to a controller does not break his control unless 
unconsciousness results. If direct control is broken for some rea¬ 
son, the daws continue to follow the last orders they were given.

The crocodile is a large, dangerous predatory reptile native to 
tropical and subtropical dimes. It spends most of its time sub¬ 
merged in swamps, rivers, or other large bodies of water. 

The crocodile is one of the most feared and ugliest predators of the 
tropics. It has a long, squat body, ranging in size from a scant foot to 
well over ten feet long. Most mature specimens range from eight to 
15 feet long, and some even larger. Many sages argue that crocodiles 
never stop growing. The crocodile has a long jaw filled with sharp, 
conical teeth. The powerful maw is superbly adapted for dragging 
prey beneath the water and dismembering it. Its four short legs are 
very powerful, and can propel the crocodile rapidly through the wa¬ 
ter and over the land. Its long tail is also very strong and is some¬ 
times used on land to unbalance its foes. 

The crocodile is covered with a tough homy hide, which 
blends in very well with the surrounding water. Its eyes and nose 
are placed so that when the crocodile floats, only they remain 
above water, enabling the beast to spot and ambush prey, The 
crocodile is adept at floating through the water and remaining 
quite still presenting the illusion that it is nothing more than a 
floating log. 

Combat: Ever voracious, hungry crocodiles will attack anything 
that looks edible, including men. They prefer to lie in wait for their 
prey (-2 penalty to opponents surprise roll), and are exceedingly sen¬ 
sitive to movements in the water. They have been known to swiftly 
and silently swim up to the shore and seize a man, dragging him 
below the surface of the water. They prefer to attack with their pow¬ 
erful jaws, causing 2d4 points of damage, and lash with their tails for 
IdI2 points of damage. Crocodiles will fight among themselves for 
any prey they seize in their jaws, sometimes tearing their victim to 
pieces. The only thing that can slow a crocodile is cold. They be¬ 
come slow and sluggish (reduced to 50% of their normal movement) 
when the temperature falls below 40 u F. 

Habitat Society; Crocodiles sometimes congregate In large 
numbers, but they are not by nature sociable, nor do they coop¬ 
erate in hunting. They have well-concealed lairs and will often 
drag their prey to their lairs before eating it. When a tasty morsel 
comes its way, a group of crocodiles will go into a feeding frenzy, 
each attempting to get a part of the feast, They hunt almost daily. 


primarily in the water, rarely on land. Their tastes are broad: 
fish, men, small mammals, aquatic birds, and even a careless lion 
has occasionally been known to fall into their grasp. Hungry 
crocodiles will sometimes upend boats to see what falls out. 

Crocodiles mate once a year, and the female lays a clutch of 
about &amp;Q eggs, carefully burying them in the sand, Unlike many 
other reptiles, the female carefully guards her eggs, protecting 
them from other predators. When the time comes for the eggs to 
hatch, the mother assists by digging the eggs out of the sand. The 
newly hatched young are thrown entirely on their own resources 
to survive. Very few of the young survive to maturity. 

Swamps and rivers are not the only abode of the crocodile. In 
recent years there have been dreadful rumors that some of these 
reptiles have made their homes in the sewers of cities in tropical 
regions, living on waste and carrion. 


Ecology; The crocodile is a formidable predator and has little 
competition for food from other water creatures. One of the few 
monsters that can compete with it is the dragonturtle, Even on 
the riverbanks it has little to fear from rival predators; most 
would prefer not to tangle with a crocodile. The only predator 
that the crocodile need fear is man, who hunts it for its tough 
hide, which can be transformed into a beautiful, gleaming leath¬ 
er. Crocodiles are also hunted to eliminate the danger that they 
represent to riverside communities. 


Giant Crocodile 

These creatures are far rarer than their smaller cousins. They attain 
sizes from 21 to 30 feel long, and they also continue to grow until 
death. Giant crocodiles typically inhabit salt water or prehistoric set¬ 
tings, where they have been know to prey upon sharks, small 
whales, and small seagoing crafts, such as fishing boats. When at- 
—rfdne a small boat, their favorite technique is to ram it, attempting 
psize and smash it open with their huge jaws. They have been 
known to gorge upon the catch within the fishing boats, and then to 
swim away, leaving the fishermen unharmed.

Giant crustaceans are peculiar mutations of crabs and freshwater 
crayfish. The first inhabits saltwater regions, while the latter is 
found only in tresh water. 

Giant Crabs 

Giant crabs look just like regular crabs except for their enormous 
size. They come in a variety of colors, such as reds, browns, and 
grays. They have eyes set on stalks, which enable them to see 
around comers and onto ledges. Their bodies are covered by a 
large, chitinous shell. Crabs are distinguished by their scuttling, 
sideways mode of locomotion. 

Combat: Always hungry crabs prefer to sneak up upon their 
prey (-3 penalty to opponent's surprise roll) and catch it in their 
pincers, dismembering and eating It. A successful attack by the 
pincers causes 2d4 points of damage. Once they have caught 
something edible, they stop to eat it, unless they are attacked. IF a 
crab finds its meal in question, it attempts to scuttle off with the 
prize, perhaps to its den. 

Habitat/Soriety: The giant crab lives on the shoreline, search¬ 
ing beaches for food and venturing into the water in search of fish 
and other aquatic life. It is well adapted to this sort of life, since it 
is able to breathe both air and water. Giant crabs frequently feed 
on large dead fish and other carrion washed up on the shore. 
They operate equally well on land and in the water. Giant crabs 
sometimes burrow into the sand during the day, emerging only at 
dusk and dawn to feed. At these times the beach is alive not only 
with the giant crabs, but with their tiny cousins as well. The gi¬ 
ants may also hunt during the day and night. 

The crab exists only on the most basic instinctive level, and is in¬ 
terested solely in survival. Crabs mate in the autumn and males at¬ 
tempt to mate with as many females as they can. Females bury their 
eggs in the sand, The eggs hatch the following spring; few hatchlings 
survive to reach maturity Nature has forced the giant crabs to be¬ 
come flexible eaters, always willing to try new food sources. 

Ecology: The giant crab performs a useful ecological function 
in keeping the seashores free of large carrion that would other¬ 
wise rot. On I he shore, il is hunted by the ultimate predators— 
humans and demihumans—for its superb meat and hard chitin- 
ous shell, which is prized by some for making armor and shields. 



Giant Crayfish 

The crayfish is essentially a freshwater lobster. It has a similar 
multi-plated shell, numerous legs, eyes set on stalks, and twx* 
wicked pincers. The giant crayfish is muddy brown or sand col¬ 
ored, depending upon the color of the river bottom it inhabits. 
Some say that the giant crayfish, like the lobster, keeps growing 
as it gets older; certain sages even argue that the giant crayfish is 
really the same species as the ordinary' crayfish, merely an ex¬ 
tremely old specimen. 

Combat: Like the crab, the crayfish prefers to ambush its prey 
(-2 penalty to opponent's surprise roll). It sits quietly on the river 
bottom, waiting, and then rushes forth to seize its food in its pin¬ 
cers. The giant crayfish does not normally represent a danger to 
adventurers, since it inhabits only deep rivers and spends ail of 
its time on the river bottom. It would therefore only attack ad¬ 
venturers who were swimming along the river bottom, and then 
only if they came within its range. An attack by a giant crayfish's 
pincers inflicts 2d6 points of damage, The crayfish prefers to drag 
its catch back to its watery lair and eat in peace. Its shell is very 
tough, giving the creature AC 4. 

Habitat/Society: The giant crayfish inhabits only wide and 
deep rivers, and feeds almost exclusively upon bottom-dwelling 
fish. Due to its great size, it can easily prey on such fish as stur¬ 
geon, carp, and large eels. It is voracious and spends most of its 
time hunting. On the whole it rarely crosses paths with adventur¬ 
ers, but it does compete with river fishermen. 

Ecology; The giant crayfish is considered a delicacy by other 
creatures, which perhaps accounts for its rarity. Nixies especially 
prize the meat of the giant crayfish* Dragon turtles, giant snap¬ 
ping turtles, merrows, giant otters, gar, giant pike, and storm gi¬ 
ants are just some of the monsters that hunt the giant crayfish. It 
is very far from being the top predator in its food chain, and must 
fight for its survival.

Crypt things are strange undead creatures that sometimes guard 
tombs, graves, and corpses. There are two types of crypt 
things—ancestral and summoned. The former type are "natural" 
creatures, while the others are called into existence by a wizard 
or priest of at least 14th level. 

A crvpt thing looks like nothing more than an animated skele¬ 
ton, save that it is always clothed in a Flowing robe of brown or 

black. Each eye socket is 

Lit by a fierce, red pinpoint of light that 

is almost hypnotic in its intensity. 

Combat: A crypt thing exists only to protect the bodies of those 
who have been laid to rest in its lair. It acts only to defend its 
crypt, Should grave robbers or vandals seek to enter and profane 
the sanctity of its tomb, the crvpt thing becomes instantly ani- 

mated. 


A crypt things first line of defense is a powerful variety of tele¬ 
portation, which it can cast once on any given group of adven¬ 
turers. Each of those attacked with this spell must roil a 

successful saving throw 

vs. spell or be instantly transported 

away from the crypt, DMs should use Lhe following table as a 
guideline, rolling IdlOQ for each person who fails the saving 
throw, but they are free to use their own judgment as well; 

01-20

61-80 

Id 10 x 100' south 

81-90 

1 dungeon level up 

91-00 

1 dungeon level down 


Those teleported by the crypt thing cannot materialize inside 
solid matter, but they do not necessarily arrive at floor level. Par¬ 
ticularly clever crypt things have been known to transport vic¬ 
tims several hundred feet into the air or atop a vast chasm, 
leaving them to fall to their deaths. 

Once it has employed this power, a crypt thing attacks by 
clawing with its skeletal hands for IdS paints of damage. 

A crypt thing can be hit only by magical weapons. 

Like ail undead, crypt things are immune to certain spells. It is 
impossible to employ a charm , hold, or sleep spell against a crypt 
thing with any chance of success. Crypt things are harmed bv 
holy water or holy symbols, as are many tmdead creatures, The 
magic that roots them to their lairs is so powerful, in fact, that it 
also eliminates any chance for priests or paladins to turn them. 



Habitat Society: Crypt things are not a natural part of our 
world; they have no organized society or culture. They are found 
wherever tombs and crypts are located. 

The most common crypt thing is the summoned variety. By use 
of a 7th-level spell (see below), any caster capable of employing 
necromantic spells can create a crypt thing. 

Ancestral crypt things are the raised spirits of the dead that 
have returned to guard the tombs of their descendants. This hap¬ 
pens only in rare cases {determined by the DM). 

Ecology: The crypt thing is not a being of this world and, thus, 
has no proper ecological niche. It is rumored that the powdered 
marrow r from a crypt thing s bones can be used to create a potion 
of unelead controL In addition, anyone who employs the bones 
of a crypt thing to manufacture a set of pipes of haunting is 50% 
likely to create a magical item that imposes a -2 penalty to its 
victims' saving throws and has double normal effectiveness if the 
saving throws fail. 

Create Crypt Thing 

7th-level Wizard or Priest spell (necromantic! 

(Reversible) 

Range: Touch Casting Time: 1 round 

Components: V,§ Area of Effect: 1 corpse 

Duration: Permanent Saving Throw: None 

This spell enables the caster to cause a single dead body to animate 
and assume the status of a crypt thing. This spell can be cast only in 
the tomb or grave area the crypt thing is to protect; the spell requires 
that the caster touch the skull of the subject body. Once animated, the 
crypt thing remains until destroyed. Only one crypt thing may guard 
a given tomb. 

A successful dispel magic spell returns the crypt thing to its original 
unarvimated state. Attempts to restore the crypt thing before this is 
done fail for any magic short of a ia£sfi. 

The reverse of this spell, destroy crypt thing, utterly annihilates 
any one such being as soon as it is touched by the caster. The target is 
allowed a saving throw vs, death magic to avoid destruction

A death knight is the horrifying corruption of a paladin or lawful 
good warrior cursed by the gods to its terrible form as punish¬ 
ment for betraying the code of honor it held in life. 

A death knight resembles a hulking knight, typically taller 
than 6 feet and weighing more than 300 pounds. Its face is a 
blackened skull covered with shards of shriveled, rotting flesh, It 
has two tiny, glowing orange-red pinpoints for eyes. Its armor is 
scorched black as if it had been in a fire. The demeanor of a death 
knight is so terrifying that even kender have been known to be¬ 
come frightened. 

A death knight's deep, chilling voice seems to echo from the 
depths of a bottomless cavern. A death knight converses in the 
language it spoke in its former life, as well as up to six additional 
languages. 

Combat: A death knight retains the fighting skills it had in its 
former life. Since it has little regard for its own safety and an 
intense hatred of most living creatures, it is an extremely danger¬ 
ous opponent. Still a death knight retains a semblance of the 
pride it held as a good warrior and tights honorably: It never 
ambushes opponents from behind, nor does it attack before an 
opponent has an opportunity to ready his weapon, Surrender is 
unknown to a death knight, and it will parley only if it senses its 
opponent has crucial information (such as the fate of a former 
family member). 

A death knight has a strength of 18(00). It usually attacks with 
a sword; 50% of the time, this is a magical sword. When a magi¬ 
cal sword is Indicated, roll ld6 and consult the following table; 

Roll Death Knight's Sword 

1 Long sword *2 

2 Two-handed sword +J 

3 Two-handed sword +4 

4 Short sword of quickness 

5 Short sword of dancing 

6 Short sword of life stealing 

A death knight wears the same armor it wore in its previous life, 
but regardless of the quality of the armor, it always has an AC of 



0. Hit points for a death Knight are determined by rolling 10- 
sided dice. 

A death knight's magical abilities make it especially danger¬ 
ous, It constantly generates fear in a Moot radius, and it can cast 
defect magic, detect invisibility t and wall of ice at will Twice per 
day it can cast dispel magic. Once per day it can use either 
power word, blind . power word, kill or power word. stun. It 
can also cast symbol of fear or symbol of pain once per day, as 
well as a 20-dice fireball once per day, All of its magical spells 
function at the 20th level of ability. 

A death knight cannot be turned, but it can be dispelled by 
holy word spell. It has the power over undead of a bth-level evil 
priest. Its magic resistance is 75%, and if an 11 or lower is rolled 
on the percentile roll, the spell is reflected back at the caster (the 
magic resistance is rerolled each time a spell is cast at a death 
knight), 

Ha bit at'Society: Death knights are former good warriors who 
were judged by the gods to be guilty of unforgivable crimes, such 
as murder or treason. (For instance, Krynns Lord Soth, the most 
famous of all death knights, murdered his wife so that he could 
continue an affair with an elf maid.) Death knights are cursed to 
remain in their former domains, usually castles or other strong¬ 
holds. They are further condemned to remember their crime in 
song on any night when the moon is full few sounds are as terri¬ 
fying as a death knight's chilling melody echoing through the 
moonlit countryside. Death knights are likely to attack any crea¬ 
ture that interrupts their songs or trespasses in their domains. 

Ecology: Death knights have no physiological functions. They 
are sometimes accompanied by skeleton warriors, liches, and 
other undead who serve as their aides.

Deepspawn are infamous horrors who give birth to many other 
varieties of monsters: a single Deepspawn can make a vast area 
dangerous, even for alert, well-armed adventurers. 

Deepspawn look like targe, rubbery spheres of mottled grey 
and brown. Six arms project from their bodies; three are tentacle- 
arms, and three are jaw-arms, ending in mouths of many teeth, A 
Deepspawn also has over 40 long, retractable, flexible eye stalks 
it extends only three or four at a time, well away from harm. 

Combat: When found, Deepspawn are usually half buried in a 
pile of slippery, shifting coins and other treasure. This may con¬ 
ceal their arms, so that tentacles and mouths erupting from the 
treasure may at first seem to be the attacks of separate monsters. 
The treasure may hamper opponents and even shield the Deep¬ 
spawn from some damage (as determined by the DM). 

A Deepspawn attacks by casting hold spells at intruders, cast¬ 
ing spells once every three rounds. Victims under a hold spell are 
gripped by tentacle-arms and constricted, as other tentacles fight 
off other intruders by wielding weapons—including any magical 
items usable by fighters. Deepspawn love to engage prey with 
weapons, and then bite them from behind with a jaw^arm. 

A tentacle-arm can slap for ld4 + l points of damage, grasp 
items or beings and move them about (with 17 Strength), wield 
delicate keys or weapons, or constrict victims. 

Constriction requires a successful attack roll (automatic if the 
victim is under a hold spell), and does ld4 points of damage, plus 
ld4 +1 points per round thereafter, In any round in which a being 
gets free, it takes only 1 point of constriction damage. Constrict¬ 
ed victims can be swung about as bludgeons—doing ld2 damage 
to any others struck, ruining spellcasting, and forcing saving 
throws on fragile items. This action causes the constricted victim 
no extra damage unless driven onto points or blades (determine 
damage on a case-by-case basis). 

Victims may only escape constriction by severing the tentacle- 
arm or tearing free. Tentade-arms release their victims if severed. 
Each arm has 2 HD: severing occurs if damage equal to half a 
tentacle-arms hit points is dealt in a concentrated area by edged 
or pointed weapons. To tear Free, roll a d20 for both the victim 
and the Deepspawn on each round of constriction, adding their 
respective strengths (17 for the Deepspawn). If the victim has the 
higher total, it wins its freedom. 


Deepspawn 



Deepspawn can also cast ESP and water breathing at will, and 
may employ a heal spell (self only), once a day. If a Deepspawn s 
life is threatened, it hurls caches of seized weapons as missiles, 
unleashes any magical items it has, and tries to escape by a 
planned route. Deepspawn seem immune to all known venoms, 
and regenerate lost arms and stalks r though slowly healing 2 hp 
per day, 

Habitat/Society: Deepspawn prefer to let their offspring fight for 
them. Their lairs are in caverns, dungeons, or ruins and are am¬ 
ply protected by traps and guardian monsters (their spawn"). 1J 
these defenses are penetrated, the Deepspawn will usually be 
found in a readily-defended room or den, and it will always have 
at least one or more escape routes, 

Deepspawn are native to the Deeps, and have successfully re¬ 
sisted attempts by dwarves, drew, duergar, cloakers, illithids, 
and aboleth to exterminate them. Deepspawn seldom make their 
lairs within 30 miles of each other, but individuals may be much 
closer together underground, on different levels. 

Ecology: Deepspawn will eat anything organic, but prefer fresh 
meat. By some unexplained, natural means, Deepspawn can 
' grow ' and give birth to any creature native to the Prime Materi¬ 
al plane it has ever devoured (but not undead or other dual di¬ 
mensional creatures). The "spawn" have the natural attacks, 
magical abilities, alignment, and intelligence of their creators. 
Class abilities and other learned skills are not passed on to them. 
A spawn "grows" in Id4 days (varying with size and complexity) 
in a Deepspawn, which must ingest meat, vegetable matter, and 
water or blood to fuel the ’"birth". The Deepspawn then opens 
and ejects a fully active spawn. Spawn are never hostile towards 
their parent, and cannot be made to attack them even by magical 
means. Spawn can attack or defend themselves within one round 
of emerging. At the DM's option, they may use certain powers or 
abilities clumsily for a few rounds.

Dinosaurs are found on alternate planes of existence, or even on 
lost continents. The frequency figures given are for areas where 
dinosaurs are normally found; in all other places, they are very 
rare at best. All dinosaurs in this entry share the following char¬

Dinosaurs, or "terrible lizards" are reptiles descended from an¬ 
cestral reptiles called thecodonts* The two types of dinosaurs are 
saurischians ("lizard-hipped*') and ornithischians ("bird- 
hipped'), named for terms describing their pelvic structures. 
Within the saurischia are the carnivorous therapods, represented 
here by tyrannosaurus, and the herbivorous sauropods, repre¬ 
sented here by diplodocus* Saurischians also include ornithomi- 
mosaurs and the related dmmaeosaurs, represented here by 
deinonychus. 

Many ornithischians have armor, horns, or both, They include 
ceratopsians, represented by triceratops: omithopods, such as 
the hadrosaurs, represented by the lambeosaurus; ankylosaurus; 
and stegosaurus. 

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Those presented 
here are generally large. Bigger species have drab colors, while 
smaller dinosaurs have a wide variety of markings. Mosi dino¬ 
saurs have a skin which is pebbly in texture: some closely related 
species of reptile have fur, and some may have feathers. 

Combat: Dinosaurs seem to be a mixture of endothermic ("warm¬ 
blooded") and exothermic ("cold-blooded"). They regulate body 
temperature internally, but also depend on external heat some¬ 
what. Though they may be slow on a cold morning, they may 
not be as slow as a typical reptile. 

Most of these huge reptiles have comparatively small brains, 
but many of the predators are quite cunning* All must eat large 
amounts of food to maintain their huge bodies. As a result, 
sauropods eat almost constantly and carnivores hunt almost 
constantly and also eat carrion* 

Though the carnivores are both voracious and ferocious, cer¬ 
tain plant eaters are very aggressive in their defense, usually with 
armor or horns, lust because they do not eat meat does not mean 
they will not kill other animals* 


Habitat/Society: Dinosaurs can be found in almost any type of 
environment, except desert, high mountains, and frozen wastes. 
They have no society and little family life, with most species 
abandoning eggs before they hatch* 

Ecology: Sages do not understand what has made dinosaurs ex¬ 
tinct on certain worlds, but they do exist in the "lost lands" on 
several worlds. There may be places where dinosaurs have con¬ 
tinued to evolve into different forms: they may be ancestors of 
modem lizard men, 

Ankylosa tints 

This armadillo-like ornithischian weighs four or five tons, most 
of this weight being its armor plating, side spines, and great, 
knobbed tail. If attacked or threatened, this creature lashes out 
with its tail, delivering blows of considerable force. 

A related species is the paleocinthus, which has better plating 
(AC -3) and a spiked, rather than dub-like, tail* 

Deinonychus 

This fast carnivore uses its speed, its long, grasping forearms, 
large teeth, and hind legs with their ripping talons in terrible 
combination. It hunts by running at prey, leaping, and raking 
with its rear daws as it claws and bites. The jump is a charge, so 
the creature gains a +2 on attack rolls* The rear talons count as 
only one attack, and cause a total of 2d6 damage. When attack¬ 
ing a larger creature, the deinonychus often jumps on Lop of it, 
and holds on with its front daws while continuing to rake with 
the rear daws, The deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a 
dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics. 

Despite being 12 leet long, this dinosaur is only about 6 feel 
tall. Its tail extends straight out behind it, held aloft by an intri¬ 
cate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its 150 pounds of 
weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. 

The deinonychus is a dromaeosaur dinosaurs which are re¬ 
lated to ornithomimosaurs: its distant relatives include the 
chicken-sized night hunter, compsognathus, and the ostrich-like 
struthiomimus. Neither is as formidable as the deinonychus. 

Diptodocus 

This sauropod lives primarily on water plants, so is often found 
in or near lakes and marshes* It and related species can also be 
found on fern prairies and in open forests. It weighs about 10 
tons. Though it usually ignores small things, it can step on any¬ 
thing in its way, or even rear up and come down on threatening 
creatures: this trampling causes 3dl0 damage. The diplodotus 


54 





Dinosaur 


can also whip with its tail for 2d8 damage. 

Related species include the huge brachiosaurus, which weighs 
about 90 tons and averages 75 feet in length. It causes SdlO dam¬ 
age when trampling. 

Elasmosaurus 

The elasmosaurus looks like a snake with fins and a thick body. It 
is aggressive, attacking anything it notices. Its neck makes up 
one-half its total length. The creature is strong, fast, and highly 
maneuverable, able to turn quickly and lunge at prey. When 
hunting, the elasmosaurus travels with its head out of the water, 
snapping down quickly to seize prey. 

This creatures relatives include many other types of ple¬ 
siosaurs and pliosaurs. Females travel onto sandy beaches to lay 
their eggs in shallow depressions. 

lambeosaurus 

This is a very common ' duck-billed rf dinosaur, bipedal, with a 
flat snout, and crests on its head. A peaceful herbivore, this ha- 
drosaur prefers to run from attack: its only defense is its lashing 
tail. It has excellent senses, used to detect predators. 

Its enemies include most carnivores. Related species include 
many other species of duck-billed dinosaurs, as well as the ig- 
uanodon, The latter has sharp thumb spikes which can cause 1-3 
damage each, in addition to its tail attack. 

Pteranodon 

Although this flying reptile typically dives for marine prey, it at¬ 
tacks any creature that appears to be vulnerable. The pteranodon 
has no teeth, but spears victims with its beak if they are too large 
to swallow at a gulp. The beak of a typical pteranodon is about A 
feet long. 

Despite the creatures huge wingspan, its wings are very light, 
and its furred body is only a little larger than a human being; the 
whole weighs only about 50 pounds. A pteranodon can carry off 
prey up to four times its own weight. 

There are all sizes of related species; close relatives have crests 
on their heads to balance their long beak for flight. 

Stegosaurus 

Another of the omithischlans, the stegosaurus, or ' plated lizard," 
is a large, stupid, herbivorous dinosaur with aggressive defenses. 
It thrives nearly anywhere and is often found on plains or in jun¬ 
gles. 

A stegosaurus is about 5 feet tall at the middle of its back; its 
humped spine is lined with a double row of leaf-shaped plates 
which help the creature absorb and dissipate heat. The creature 
has a spiked tail, with four or more bony spikes of up to 3 feet in 
length. An enlarged spinal node helps relay commands to the tail 
and rear legs. The stegosaurus continually turns its posterior to¬ 
wards an enemy, while tucking its head low. ft reacts in the same 
manner if anything near seems threatening. 

Similar species include the dacentrus, which has spikes along 
its backbone instead of plates, and the kentrosaurus, which has 
bony plates along the front half of its spine, and spikes along the 
rear half. All have spiked tails. 

Triceratops 

The largest of the ceratopsians, or horn-faced dinosaurs, and by 
Far the most aggressive, this beaked herbivore is a plains-d weller 
It has a huge front plate of bone protecting its 6-foot-long head, 
from which project two great horns (each over 3 feet long), while 
a shorter horn juts from its nose. The head and neck are AC 2; its 
body is not armored, so is AC 6. The Lnceratops weighs just over 
10 tons. 




Any creature that infringes on the territory of these reptiles is 
likely to be charged and skewered. Smaller creatures are tram¬ 
pled, suffering 2dl2 points of damage. The triceratops also uses 
its horns in fights for dominance within the herd, so it is not unu¬ 
sual to find specimens with past injuries on their heads. 

Related species have the same bony plate which protects their 
necks, as well as different numbers of horns. The monoclonius 
has a single nose-hom; the pentaceratops has three true horns, 
like the triceratops, plus hom-iike protrusions jutting from its 
cheeks; and the stvracosaurus has a frill of horns located around 
the edge of its neck-plate. 

Tyrannosaurus 

This ravenous creature is one of the most fearsome and terrible of 
all carnivorous dinosaurs. Despite its huge size and eight-ton 
weight, the monster is a swift runner, Its huge head is nearly 6 
feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6 inches in length. 

Tyrannosaurus rex, the “tyrant lizard king," is a plains dweller, 
and so relentlessly and stupidly fierce that it will attack a small 
triceratops. kill it, and swallow its head in one gulp—thus killing 
itself in a matter of hours as the horns of the victim pierce the 
stomach of the victor. 

This dinosaur's favorite food is any hadrosaur, such as the 
trachodon. The monster pursues and eats nearly anything; crea¬ 
tures of man-size or smaller are swallowed whole on a natural 
attack roll of 18 or higher. The tyrannosaurus also eats carrion, 
chasing away any smaller creatures to steal a meal found with its 
keen sense of smell. 

There are many other species of camosaur, some smaller and 
faster than tyrannosaurus. Some have stronger arms and more 
dangerous upper claws.

The displacer beast is a magical creature that resembles a puma 
with two powerful black tentacles growing from its shoulders. 
Very rare, they stay far from human habitations. 

The displacer beast has the blue-black coloring of a dark pan¬ 
ther, and a long cat-like body and head. Females range in length 
from 8 to 9 feet, and weigh 450 pounds; males are 10 to 12 feel 
long, and weigh up to 500 Lbs, They have 6 legs. Tentacles are 
tipped with rough homy edges that can inflict terrible wounds. 
Their eyes glow bright green, even after death. 

Combat: The displacer beast is a fierce, savage creature that 
hates all forms of life. Highly aggressive, the displacer beast will 
attack on sight, using its tentacles to inflict 2-8 f2&lt;i4] points of 
damage to its victims. 

Their main advantage in combat is their magical power of dis¬ 
placement which allows them to appear to be some 3 feet from 
their actual location, Anyone attacking a displacer beast does so 
at on his attack roll. In addition, the beasts save as 12th-level 
fighters: adding +2 to their die rolls. 

To determine the true position of the displacer beast and its 
illusion, roll ldlQ. On 1-5, the illusion is in front of the creature, 
6-7 to the creature's left, 8-9, to the right. On 10, the illusion is 
behind the beasts actual position. Although this ability is magi¬ 
cal the beast s location can not be determined by dispel or detect 
magic. Only true seeing will reveal its position. 

Displacer beasts will not use their claws or teeth unless near 
death, or when in combat with a very large opponent. If they do 
employ them, each claw does 1-3 points of damage, and each bite 
does 1-8 points of damage. 


Displacer beasts mate m the autumn, and the young are born 
in spring. A mated pair of displacer beasts makes its home in a 
cave, producing Utters of 1-4 young. The cubs, about the size of 
domestic cats, are bom without tentacles and reach maturity, 
though not full size, within 4 months. They remain in the cave 
until their displacement abilities are fully developed. This is fol¬ 
lowed by a two month period during which the cubs are taught 
how to hunt. When this is completed, the family group disbands 
and the monsters wander off to join separate packs. 
While raising young, the monsters are fiercely protective of their 
lairs. One adult always remains with the cubs, usually the fe¬ 
male, while the other goes off to hunt. Dead prey is dragged back 
to the lair to be eaten by the family Lairs are littered with the 
bones, equipment, and the treasures of its victims. 

Naturally vicious and almost evil at times, displacer beasts 
harbor an undying hatred of blink dogs. Many theories attempt 
to account for this enmity Some sages believe it springs from an¬ 
tipathy in temperaments—the lawful good blink dog would nat¬

Habitat, Society Displacer beasts are carnivores. Unless they are 
raising young, they usually run in packs, carving a savage swath 
of destruction as they go. They hate all life, and will sometimes 
kill purely for pleasure. Fierce and vicious as they are, however, 
displacer beasts never fight among themselves. The pack is a 
well-run and highly efficient killing machine. When encountered 
in packs, displacer beasts are more than a match for many large 
creatures and have been known to make a meal of ores, goblins, 
and bands of men. Any creature entering their territory is viewed 
as potential prey 


rare however, since they do not share the same territory. 

Ecology: Displacer beasts have little to fear from other large 
predators, save perhaps trolls or giants. Some wizards and alche¬ 
mists value their hides for use in certain magical preparations, 
and will offer generous rewards for them. The eyes of a displacer 
beast are a highly prized, if uncommon, good luck charms 
among thieves who believe that they will protect the bearer from 
detection.

Smaller than wolves, the appearance of the wild dog varies from 
place to place. Most appear very wotf-like. while others seem to com¬ 
bine the looks of a wolf and a jackal, 

Combat: Wild dogs fight as an organized pack. They favor small 
game, and attack men and human habitations only in times of great 
hunger. The bite of a wild dog inflicts 1-4 points of damage. 

Habitat Society: Wild dogs arc found almost anywhere. They run 
in packs, and are led by the dominant male. The pack usually hunts a 
variety of game, even attacking deer or antelope. Pups are bom in 
the spring. Wild dogs can be tamed if separated from their pack. 

Ecology : Wild dogs are omnivores which usually thrive on a com¬ 
bination of hunting and foraging* 

War Dogs 

Generally large mastiffs or wolfhounds, they have keen senses of 
smell and hearing, making them adept at detecting intruders. Most 
war dogs are not usually vicious, and will rarely attack without 
cause, 

The status of war dogs varies greatly: some are loyal and beloved 
pets, some are watch dogs others are hunting dogs, and some are 
trained for battle. 

Blink Dogs 

Blink dogs are yellowish brown canines which are stockier and more 
muscular than other wild dogs. They are intelligent and employ a 
limited form of teleportation when they hunt, 

A blink dog attack is well organized. They will blink to and fro 
without any obvious pattern, using their powers to position them- 
selves tor an attack. Fully 75% of the time they are able to attack 
their targets from the rear, A dog will teleport on a roll of 7 or better 
on a 12-sided die. To determine where the dog appears, roll a 12-sided 
die: 1 = in front of opponent, 2 = shielded (or left) front flank, 3 = 
unshielded (or right! front flank, 4-12 = behind. When blinking, the 
dog will appear from 1 to 3 feet from its opponent and will immedi¬ 
ately be able to attack. 

Blinking is an innate power and the animal will never appear inside 
a space occupied by a solid object. If seriously threatened, the entire 
pack will blink out and not return. 

Blink dogs are intelligent, and communicate in a complex language 
of barks, yaps, whines, and growls. They inhabit open plains and 
avoid human haunts. A lair will contain 3-12 (3d4) pups 50% of the 


time (1-2 hit dice, 1-2/1-3 hit points damage/attack). These puppies 
can be trained and are worth between 1,000 to 2,000 gold pieces. 

Death dog 

Death dogs are large two-headed hounds which are distinguished by 
their penetrating double bark. Death dogs hunt in large packs. 

Each head is independent, and a bite does 1-10 points of damage. 
Victims must save vs. poison or contract a rotting disease which will 
kill them in 4-24 (4d6) days. Only a cure disease spell can save them. 
A natural roll of 19 or 20 on their attack die means that a man-sized 
opponent is knocked prone and attacks at a -4 until able to rise to its 
feet again, There is an S5% chance that death dogs will attack hu* 
mans on sight.

Often mistaken for baneful monsters, moon dogs are native crea¬ 
tures of Elysium and champions of the causes of good. They of¬ 
ten appear in the Prime Material plane to fight evil wherever it 
shows itself. 

Moon dogs look very similar to large Wolf hounds. Their 
strange heads are slightly human in appearance, giving the ani¬ 
mals a very intelligent look. The creatures forepaws are adapt¬ 
able, giving the moon dogs the ability to travel bipedally or on all 
fours. They are dark colored animals, ranging from dark gray to 
deep black. Moon dogs have amber eyes. 

Moon dogs speak their own language, and they can communi¬ 
cate with all canines and lupines as well. They can speak com¬ 
mon using a limited form of telepathy. 

Combat: Woe to those who enter combat with a moon dog. 
These creatures of good are potenL fighters and merciless against 
evil. Their powerful bite inflicts 3-12 points of damage. 

Moon dogs prefer to attack with their keening howk This bay¬ 
ing is harmful to evil creatures only. Any evil creature within an 
80 foot radius of a hmymg moon dog is affected as by a fear spell 
cast at I2th-level of magic use. Additional moon dogs baying 
have a cumulative effect. The howlmg will also cause 5-8 points 
of damage per round to evil creatures within 40 feet. In addition, 
the hoxultug will cause intense physical pain to extra-planar crea¬ 
tures of evil alignment so much that they are 5% likely per moon 
dog howling to return to their plane. Moon dogs can whine to 
dispel illusions or bark to dispel evil, once per round. 

The following spell-like powers (at 12th-!evel of use) are avail¬ 
able to a moon dog one at a time, once per round, at will: 


• char times per day 

• cure disease, by lick, I time per individual per day 

• cure light wounds, by lick, 1 time per individual per day 

• 

• i. vay &gt; acLivc 

• 

• de t l l i ma£ ,v a I w a y s active 

• defect snares &amp; pits, always active 

• 

• tight 

• mirror image. 3 times per day 



• dmdf 1 time per day 

• slow poison, by lick, 1 time per individual per day 

• I'lllf i f fog 

Moon dogs can become ethereal and have the ability to travel 
in the ethereal and Astral plane at will. They have superior vision 
equal to double normal vision, including 60' infravision. Com¬ 
bined with an unusually keen sense oF smell and hearing, this 
grants moon dogs the detection abilities listed above, plus the 
ability to detect all illusions. Association with a moon dog lor 
one hour or more removes charms and acts as a remove curse. 

When in shadowy light, a moon dog is able to move in such a 
way as to effectively create magic equal to a hypnotic pattern of 
shadows. Only evil creatures will be affected. At the same time, 
each creature of good within the area will effectively gain a pro¬ 
tection from evil and remove fear spell benefit. Moon dogs may 
not attack or perform any other action when weaving this pat¬ 
tern of shadows. It requires one full round to weave and extends 
to a range of 50 feet. The moon dog can dispel magic, but doing 
so will force it back to its own plane immediately. 

Moon dogs may be damaged only by +2 or better magical 
weapons. They are never surprised (due to their keen senses) and 
cause opponents to subtract 3 from their surprise rolls. Moon 
dogs are immune to fear spells. They make all saving throws at a 
+ 2 bonus and takes half or quarter damage. 

Habitat Sodetyr Moon dogs are native to the plane of Elysium, 
They are champions of good and will often travel about the up¬ 
per planes and the Prime Material plane to challenge evil. 

Moon dogs are friendly to all good and neutral races and those 
friendly to those races. They will not long associate with anyone 
because they are constantly on the move, hunting evil. 

Ecology: Moon dogs will often communicate with communities 
of men, using telepathy, in order to locate trouble spots among 
them.

Dolphins are intelligent seagoing mammals. 

While all dolphins share a variety of common traits, the spe¬ 
cies comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Their long, compact 
bodies are superbly adapted to the aquatic environment, and dol¬ 
phins are among the most powerful swimmers in the oceans. All 
breeds of dolphins have a large tin on their backs, two flippers, a 
powerful tail jaws filled with many sharp teeth, a blow hole, and 
are 5 to b feet long. Most common and well-known are the gray, 
or bottle-nosed dolphins, so named for their gray skin and bottle¬ 
shaped snouts. Other varieties have two-toned blue and gray col¬ 
oring. The species communicates through an intricate speech 
consisting of high-pitched sounds, some out of the range of hu¬ 
man hearing. 


Combat: Inherently peaceful, dolphins will generally attack on¬ 
ly if threatened. Unless outnumbered 2 to 1, dolphins always at¬ 
tack sharks. Whether attacking a foe or defending their school, 
dolphins fight as an organized unit, responding to commands 
from their leader. They fight with special vehemence to protect 
their young, and a select number of dolphins may sometimes en¬ 
gage in a holding action, sacrificing themselves so that the re¬ 
mainder of the school can swim to safety, 


Hahit.il/Society: Dolphins are completely carnivorous, living on 
a diet of fish. Though they can remain submerged for several 
minutes at a time, they must surface regularly to breathe. Unlike 
most mammals, breathing is a conscious, rather than uncon¬ 
scious action on the part of dolphins: in other words, they liter¬ 
ally must remember to breathe. Newborn dolphins are assisted to 
the surface to breathe by their mothers and a female dolphin mid¬ 
wife. Dolphins are by nature playful good-tempered, and lawful 
good, despising evil creatures. Most roam the oceans in schools, 
numbering as large as 20 dolphins, swimming where their fancy 
suits them. They never fight among themselves or with other 
breeds of dolphins. Dolphins are famous for the great pleasure 
they take in life: when swimming they often perform dazzling 
aquatic stunts, leaping in and out of the water in a spectacular 
fashion. They will also play with objects that they find and enjoy 
games. Dolphins sometimes follow ships, entertaining the crews 
and passengers with their antics. 

About 10% of all dolphins live in organized communities. 
These groups have ld4 + l swordfish (AC 6, move 24, 1+1 Hit 



Dice, 2d6 points of damage/attack) or 1-3 narwhales (AC 6, 
move 21, 4+4 Hit Dice, 2dl2 points of damage/attack) as 
guards, depending on the climatic region, tf a community is 
found, there is a 75% possibility that there are ld4 additional 
communities of dolphins within a five-mile radius. These orga^ 
nized communities of dolphins do not tolerate the presence of 
evil sea creatures in their domain, and if necessary enlist the aid 
ot nomadic schools of dolphins to drive out evil creatures. Any 
region inhabited by dolphin communities is also shark and killer 
whale free. 

Dolphins are highly intelligent and take a benign distant inter¬ 
est in human doings, They will always help humans in distress, 
guiding them to the shore and keeping the sharks at bay. Certain 
solitary dolphins, known as rogues, have been known to form 
closer attachments to humans, accompanying them in a friendly 
fashion on swimming and fishing expeditions. These rogues often 
play dolphin games with their human companions. Dolphins are 
far more valuable to men in other respects. Friendly dolphins 
have warned sailors of the approach of pirate ships and the inten¬ 
tions of evil sea creatures. More than one ship owes its safe arriv¬ 
al in port to the timely intercession and warning of dolphins. 
They have come to men s aid when their ships were attacked by 
mermen and sahuagin. Dolphins have been known to raid sa- 
huagtn communities and destroy their eggs, for dolphins perceive 
these monsters as a threat to their safety. 

Ecology: The dolphin is both a hunter and hunted in its marine 
world. Sharks and other large evil sea creatures hunt the dolphin 
with enthusiasm. Despite its many enemies, the dolphin has 
many distinct advantages Lhat enable it to survive and even 
flourish. Not only is it a strong, swift swimmer, but its intelli¬ 
gence and organized lifestyle are highly effective defenses against 
its enemies.

The doppleganger is a master of mimicry that survives by taking 
the shapes of men, derm humans, and humanoids. 

Dopplegangers are bipedal and generally humanoid in appear¬ 
ance. Their bodies are covered with a thick, hairless gray hide, 
which gives them a natural AC of 5. They are. however, rarely 
seen in their true forms. 

Combat: This monster is able to assume the shape of any hu¬ 
manoid creature between four and eight feet high. The dopple¬ 
ganger chooses a victim, duplicates his form, and then attempts 
to kill ihe original and assume his place. The doppleganger is able 
to use ESP and can imitate its victim with 90% accuracy, even 
duplicating the victims clothing and equipment. If unsuccessful 
in taking its victim s place, the doppleganger attacks, relying on 
the ensuing confusion to make it indistinguishable from its vic¬ 
tim. A doppleganger is immune to sleep and charm spells and 
rolls all saving throws as if he was a lOlh-level fighter, 

Dopplegangers work in groups and act together to ensure that 
their attacks and infiltrations are successful. They are very intel¬ 
ligent and usually take the time to plan their attacks with care. If 
a group of the monsters spots some potential victims, the dopple¬ 
gangers often trail their targets* wailing for a good chance to 
strike, choosing their time and opportunity with care. They may 
wait until nightfall, or until their victims are alone, or even fol¬ 
low them to an inn. 

Habitat Society; Dopplegangers are rumored to be artificial be¬ 
ings that were created long ago by a powerful wizard or godllng. 
They were originally intended to be used as spies and assassins in 
an ancient, highly magical wan Their creator died long ago, but 
they live on, still working as spies for evil powers, thieves, and 
government, They have even been known to work as assassins. 

All dopplegangers belong to a single tribe. Although this is 
rare, groups of dopplegangers can be found anywhere at any 
time, and in unexpected locations. Working as a unit, they select 
a group of victims, such as a family or a group of travelers. Basi¬ 
cally lazy dopplegangers find it easier to survive and live com¬ 
fortably by taking humanoid, and especially human, shape* 
They prefer to take the form of someone comfortably provided 
for, and shun assuming the form of hardworking peasants. Since 



they are only 90% accurate in their mimicry, most dopplegangers 
are eventually discovered and driven out, and then forced once 
more to assume a new shape. 

Dopplegangers are found most often in their true forms in a 
dungeon or in the wilderness. Groups often set up a lair in an 
area well-suited to ambush and surprise, patrolling a regular ter¬ 
ritory. These bands make a good living by attacking weak hu¬ 
manoid monsters or travelers and stealing their food and 
treasure. If food and treasure are scarce, they hire out to a power¬ 
ful wizard or thieves' guild. 

A doppleganger who has been hired to replace a specific per¬ 
son will plan its attack with special care, learning as much about 
the victim and his environment as it can. 

The dopplegangers' weaknesses are greed and cowardice. They 
spend their lives in avid pursuit of gold and other wealth. If at¬ 
tacking a group of adventurers, for example, they often choose 
the richest-lookmg one to attack first. If they target a party of 
adventurers, the dopplegangers wait until the party is on the way 
out of the dungeon and heading back to town. Since they are 
cowardly however, they prefer to take the easiest route toward 
riches. A doppleganger who chooses a rich adventurer avoids 
risks once the treasure is safely in hand, and retreats at the earli¬ 
est opportunity, making some plausible excuse for separating 
from the human members of the group, They sometimes hire out 
as spies and assassins for money as well. 

Ecology: Dopplegangers are sophisticated and dangerous para¬ 
sites, living off the labors of others. They must also be reckoned 
with as clever and effective spies and assassins who can wreak 
political mayhem in positions of power. Evil wizards have on 
rare occasions controlled entire kingdoms for short periods of 
time by replacing a king, prince, or councilor with a dopple¬ 
ganger.

The dracolich is an undead creature resulting from the unnatural 
transformation of an evil dragon* The mysterious Cult of the 
Dragon practices the powerful magic necessary for the creation of 
the dracolich, though other practitioners are also rumored to exist. 

A dracolich can be created from any of the evil dragon sub¬ 
species. A dracolich retains the physical appearance of Us original 
body, except that its eyes appear as glowing points of light Floating 
In shadowy eye sockets. Skeletal or semi-skeletaJ dracoliehes have 
been observed on occasion. 

The senses of a dracolich are similar to those of its original form: 
it can detect invisible objects and creatures (including those hidden 
in darkness of fog) within a LO-foot radius per age category and 
also possesses a natural clairaudience ability while in its lair equal 
to a range of 20 feet per age category. A dracolich can speak, cast 
spells, and employ the breath weapon of its original form; it can 
cast each of its spells once per day and can use its breath weapon 
once every three combat rounds. Additionally a dracolich retains 
the intelligence and memory' of its original form. 

Combat: Dracoliehes are immune to charm, sleep , enfeeble- 
ment, polymorph, cold (magical or natural), electricity, hold , in¬ 
sanity, and death spells or symbok . They cannot be poisoned, 
paralyzed, or turned by priests. They have the same magic resist¬ 
ance as their original forms; only magical attacks from wizards 
of 6th level or higher, or from monsters of 6 or more Hit Dice 
have a chance of affecting dracoliehes. 

The Armor Class of a dracolich is equal to the Armor Class of 
its original form, bettered by —2 (for example, if the AC of the 
original form was — 1. the AC of the dracolich is “3). Attacks on 
a dracolich, due to its magical nature, do not gain any attack or 
damage roll bonuses. 

Initially a dracolich has the same morale rating as its original 
Form. However, after a dracolich is successful in its first battle, its 
morale rating permanently becomes Fearless (19 base); this as¬ 
sumes that the opponent or opponents involved in the battle had 
a Hit Dice total of at least 100% of the Hit Dice of the dracolich 
(for instance, a 16-HD dracolich must defeat an opponent or op¬ 
ponents of at least 16 total HD to receive the morale increase)* 
Once a dracolich receives the morale increase, it becomes im¬ 
mune to magical fear as well. 



The dracolich has a slightly stronger ability to cause tear in oppo¬ 
nents than it did in its original form: opponents must roll their sav¬ 
ing throws vs* spell with a — 1 penalty (in addition to any other 
relevant modifiers) to resist the dracolich's fear aura. The gaze of the 
dracolich's glowing eyes can also paralyze creatures within 40 yards 
if they fail their saving throws (creatures of 6th level |or 6 Hit Dice] 
or higher gain a +3 bonus to their saving throw's), [f a creature suc¬ 
cessfully saves against the gaze of a dracolich, it is permanently im¬ 
mune to the gaze of that particular dracolich. 

The attack routine of a dracolich is similar to that of its origi¬ 
nal form; for example, a dracolich that w T as originally a green 
dragon will bring down a weak opponent with a series of physi¬ 
cal attacks, but it will stalk more formidable opponents, attack¬ 
ing at an opportune moment with its breath weapon and spells. 

All physical attacks, such as clawing and biting, inflict the 
same damage as the dracolich's original form, plus 2dS points of 
chilling damage, A victim struck by a dracolich who fails a sav¬ 
ing throw vs, paralyzation is paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. Immu¬ 
nity to cold damage, temporary or permanent, negates the 
chilling damage but not the paralyzation, Dracoliehes cannot 
drain life levels. 

All dracoliehes can attempt undead control (as per a potion of 
undead control ) once every three days on any variety of undead 
with 60 yards. The undead's saving throws against this power 
suffer a -3 penalty; if the undead control is successful, it lasts for 
one turn only. While undead control is in use, the dracolich can¬ 
not use other spells* If the dracolich interrupts its undead control 
before it has been used for a full turn, the dracolich must still wait 


three days before the power can be used again. 

If a dracolich or proto-draco lie h is slain, its spirit immediately 
returns to its host. If there is no corpse in range for it to possess, 
the spirit is trapped in the host until such a time—if ever—that a 
corpse becomes available. A dracolich is difficult to destroy. It 
can be destroyed outright by power word , kd/ or a similar spell. 
If its spirit is currently contained in its host, destroying the host 
when a suitable corpse is not within range eff ectively destroys the 
dracolich. Likewise, an active dracolich is unable to attempt fur¬ 
ther possessions if its host is destroyed. The fate of a disembodied 
dracolich spirit—that is, a spirit with no body or host—is un¬ 
known, but it is presumed that it is drawn to the lower planes.

Dracolich 


Habital/Sodety: The creation of a dracolich is a complex proc¬ 
ess involving the transformation of an evil dragon by arcane 
magical forces, the most notorious practitioners of which are 
members of the Cult of the Dragon. The process is usually a co¬ 
operative effort between the evil dragon and the wizards, but es¬ 
pecially powerful wizards have been known to coerce an evil 
dragon to undergo the transformation against its will. 

Any evil dragon is a possible candidate for transformation, al¬ 
though old dragons or older with spell-casting abilities are prefer¬ 
red. Once a candidate is secured, the wizards first prepare the 
dragon's host, an inanimate object that will hold the dragons life 
force. The host must be a solid item of not less than 2,000 gp 
value resistant to decay (wood, for instance, is unsuitable!. A 
gemstone is commonly used for a host, particularly ruby, pearl, 
carbuncle, and jet and is often set in the hilt of a sword or other 
weapon. The host is prepared by casting enchant an item upon it 
and speaking the name of the evil dragon; the item may resist the 
spell by successfully saving vs. spell as an llth-level wizard. If 
the spell is resisted, another item must be used for the host. U the 
spell is not resisted, the item can then function as a host. If de¬ 
sired, glassteel can be cast upon the host to protect it. 

Next, a special potion is prepared for the evil dragon to con¬ 
sume. The exact composition of the potion varies according to 
the age and type of the dragon, but it must contain precisely sev¬ 
en ingredients, among them a potion of evil dragon control a 
potion of invulnerability, and the blood of a vampire. When the 
evil dragon consumes the potion, the results are determined as 
follows (roil percentile dice);

Potion works. 


H the potion ivorks, the dragons spirit transfers to the host, re- 
gardless of the distance between the dragons body and the host. 
A dim light within the host indicates the presence of the spirit. 
While contained in the host, the spirit cannot take any actions; it 
cannot be contacted nor attacked by magic. The spirit can re¬ 
main in the host indefinitely. 

Once the spirit is contained in the host the host must be 
brought within 90 feet of a reptilian corpse; under no circum¬ 
stances can the spirit possess a living body. The spirits original 
body is ideal, but the corpse of any reptilian creature that died or 
was killed within the previous 30 days h suitable. 

The wizard who originally prepared the host must touch the 
host, cast a magic jar spell while speaking the name of the drag¬ 
on, then touch the corpse, The corpse must fail a saving throw 
vs. spell for the spirit to successfully possess it; if it saves, it will 
never accept the spirit. The following modifiers apply to the roll: 

-10 if the corpse is the spirit s own former body (which can be 
dead for any length of time). 

_ 4 if the corpse is of the same alignment as the dragon. 

-4 if the corpse is that of a true dragon (any type). 

-3 if the corpse is that of a firedrake, ice lizard, wyvem, or 
fire lizard. 

-1 if the corpse is that of a dracolisk, dragonne, dinosaur, 
snake, or other reptile. 


If the corpse accepts the spirit, it becomes animated by the spirit. 
It the animated corpse is the spirit's former body, it immediately 
becomes a dracolich; however, St will not regain the use of its 
voice and breath weapon for another seven days (note that it will 
not be able to cast spells with verbal components during this 
time). At the end of seven days, the dracolich regains the use of 
its voice and breath weapon. 

If the animated corpse is not the spirit's former body, it imme¬ 
diately becomes a proto-dracolich, A proto-dracolich has the 
mind and memories of its original form, but has the hit points 
and immunities to spells and priestly turning of a dracolich. A 
proto-dracolich can neither speak nor cast spells: further, it can¬ 
not cause chilling damage, use a breath weapon, or cause fear as 
a dracolich. Its strength, movement, and Armor Class are those 
of the possessed body. 

To become a full dracolich, a proto-dracolich must devour at 
least 10% of its original body, Unless the body has been dis¬ 
patched to another plane of existence, a proto-dracolich can al¬ 
ways sense the presence of its original body, regardless of the 
distance, A proto-dracolich will tirelessly seek out its original 
body to the exclusion of all other activities, If its original body 
has been burned, dismembered, or otherwise destroyed, the 
proto-dracolich need only devour the ashes or pieces equal to or 
exceeding 10% of its original body mass (total destruction of the 
original body is possible only through use of a disintegrate or 
similar spell; the body could be reconstructed with a uhsli or sim¬ 
ilar spell, so long as the spell is cast in the same plane as the disin¬ 
tegration). U a proto-dracolich is unable to devour its original 
body it is trapped in its current form until slain. 

A proto-dracolich transforms into a full dracolich within seven 
days after it devours its original body. When the transformation 
is complete, the dracolich resembles its original body; it can now 
speak, cast spells, and employ the breath weapon of its original 
body, in addition to having all of the abilities of a dracolich. 

The procedure for possessing a nevv corpse is the same as ex¬ 
plained above, except that the assistance of a wizard is no longer 
necessary (casting magic jar is required only for the first posses¬ 
sion). If the spirit successfully rc-possesses its original body, it 
once again becomes a full dracolich If the spirit possesses a dif¬ 
ferent body, it becomes a proto-dracolich and must devour its 
former body to become a full dracolich, 

A symbiotic relationship exists between a dracolich and the 
wizards who create it. The wizards honor and aid their dracolich, 
as well as providing it with regular offerings of treasure items. In 
return, the dracolich defends its wizards against enemies and oth¬ 
er threats, as well as assisting them in their various schemes. Like 
dragons, dracoliches are loners, but they take comfort in the 
knowledge that they have allies, 

Dracoliches are generally found in the same habitats as the 
dragons from which they w'ere created; dracoliches created from 
green dragons, for instance, are likely to be found in subtropical 
and temperate forests. Though they do not live with their wiz¬ 
ards, their lairs are never more than a few miles away. Draco¬ 
liches prefer darkness and are usually encountered at night, in 
shadowy forests, or in underground labyrinths. 

Ecology; Dracoliches are never hungry, but they must eat m or¬ 
der to refuel their breath weapons. Like dragons, dracoliches can 
consume nearly anything, but prefer the food eaten by their orig¬ 
inal forms (for instance, if a dracolich was originally a red drag¬ 
on, it prefers fresh meat). The body of a destroyed dracolich 
crumbles into a foul-smelling powder within a lew hours; this 
powder can be used by knowledgeable wizards as a component 
for creating potions of undead control and similar magical sub¬ 
stances.

Dragon, General 


Dragons are an ancient, winged reptilian race. They are known ant! 
feared for their size, physical prowess and magical abilities. The oldest 
dragons are among the most powerful creatures in the world. Most drag¬ 
ons are identified by the color of their scales. 

There are many know subspecies of dragons, several of which fall into 
three broad categories: chromatic, gem. and metallic dragons. Chromatic 
dragons include black, blue, green, red, and white dragons: all are ex¬ 
tremely evil and are feared by most, The metallic dragons are the brass, 
bronze, copper, gold and silver dragons; these are noble and good, high¬ 
ly respected by wise people. 

The gem dragons are the amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, and to¬ 
paz dragons; they are neutral with respect to good and evil and are very 
charismatic and suave, masters of persuasion who delight in riddles. 
Though generally smaller and dower than other dragons, gem dragons 
are often wiser and more intelligent, and have other powers to compen¬ 
sate. like psionics. 

In addition to the dragons in these three classifications, there are other 
dragons that may at first seem to be members of those categories. For 
instance, the steel dragon seems to be a metallic dragon, but has only one 
breath weapon; white each true" metallic dragon has two. Likewise, the 
brown dragon seems to be a typical, evil chromatic dragon; but has no 
wings, so is not a true" chromatic dragon. 

Although all subspecies of dragons are believed to have come from the 
same roots tens of thousands of years ago, the present subspecies keep to 
themselves, working together only under extreme circumstances, such as 
a powerful mutual threat. Good dragons never work with evil dragons, 
however, though a few neutral dragon specimens have been known to 
associate with evil or good dragons. Gold dragons occasionally associate 
freely with silver dragons and emerald dragons are sometimes found 
with sapphire dragons. 

When evil dragons of different species encounter each other, they usu¬ 
ally fight to protect their territories. While good dragons of different sub¬ 
species are more tolerant of each other, they are also very territorial. 
They usually try to work out differences in a peaceful manner. Gem drag¬ 
ons often settle inter-species disputes with riddling contests. 

AH subspecies of dragons have 12 age categories, and gain more abili¬ 
ties and greater power as they age. Dragons range in size from several feet 
upon hatching to more than 100 feet, after they have attained the status 
of great wyrrrt. The exact size varies according to age and subspecies, A 
dragon s wingspan b about equal to its body length: 15-20% of a dragons 
body length is neck. 

Generally when multiple dragons are encountered they are a mated 
pair and young. Mated dragons are always young adults, adults, or ma¬ 
ture adults; young dragons found with their parents are of the young 
adult stage or younger. To determine the age of young dragons roll ld6:1 
“ egg; 2 = hatchling: 3 - very young; 4 = young; 5 = juvenile; 6 - 
young adult. 

During the early pan of a dragon s young adult stage it leaves its par¬ 
ents, greed driving it on to start a lair of its own, Sometimes, although 
rarely, Juvenile dragons leave their parents to start their own lives. As a 
pair of mated dragons age beyond the mature adult stage, they split up. 
independence and the lust for treasure driving them apart. Older dragons 
of either sex sometimes raise young, but only on their own—the other 
parent leaves when the eggs are laid. 

Dragons, especially older ones, are generally solitary due to necessity 
and preference They' distance themselves from civilization, which they 
consider to be a petty and foolish mortal invention. 

Dragons are fearsome predators, but scavenge when necessary and can 
eat almost anything it they are hungry enough, A dragon's metabolism 
operates like a highly efficient furnace, making use oi 95 % of all the food 
the dragon eats. A dragon can also metabolize inorganic material, and 
some dragons have developed a taste for such fare. 

Although dragons goals and ideals vary among subspecies, all dragons 
are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and 
gathering as many gems, jewels, and magical items as possible. They find 
treasure pleasing to look at. and they bask in the radiance of the magical 
items. For a dragon, there H never enough treasure- Those with large 
hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only 
to patrol the immediate areas or to get food. Dragons like to make beds of 
them treasure, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time 
they mature tu the great wyrm stage, hundreds of gems and coins are 
imbedded in their hides 


Dragon Defenses; A dragon's Armor Class improves as it gets older and 
the creature becomes tougher. Old dragons or older dragons are immune 
to normal missiles; their gem-encrusted hides deflect arrows and other 
small projectiles. Large missiles (from catapults, giants, etc.) and magical 
missiles affect them normally. Young adult and older dragons radiate a 
personal aura that makes them partially resistant to harmful magic A 
dragon's resistance to magic increases as it ages, 

Dragon Hide; Dragon skin Is prized by armorers with the skill to turn it 
into shields and armor, valuable because of its appearance and the pro¬ 
tection it affords. Dragon armor grants its wearer an Armor Class of 4 
less than the Armor Gass of the dragon it was taken from, tor a mini¬ 
mum Armor Class of 8. Fur example, armor trom a juvenile brass dragon 
(AC OJ grants Its wearer AC 4, Dragon armor h supple and non-bulky. 
weighing only 25 pounds. 

The scales of gem dragons take on properties of actual gems: they are 
f aceted and reflect light. They are slightly more brittle than those of other 
dragons, so armor made frum them requires repair more often 

Dragon armor affords no extra protection, such as resistance to fire or 
cold, although the armor can be enchanted to provide such protection. A 
dragon's resistance to certain elements is based on Its loLal makeup, not 
just its skin. Plain dragon armor is expensive to make, costing l.QQQ- 
10,000 gp, based on the workmanship and protection the armor affords 
Dragon skin armor can be enchanted, just as other forms of armor can, to 
a maximum of +5. 

Dragon shields also offer no additional protection. They are made ot 
stretched hide over a wooden frame. Such shields weigh 3 pounds (if 
small) or 8 pounds (if largel and cost 20120 or 30-180 gold pieces. 

Dragon Senses: All dragons have excellent senses of sight, smell, and 
hearing. Their enhanced senses enable them to detect all invisible objects 
and creatures (including creatures or items hidden in darkness or log? 
within a radius equal to 10 feet times their age category. All dragons pos¬ 
sess a natural ckiraudience ability with respect to their lairs; the range is 
20 feet per age category. The dragon must concentrate on a specific sec¬ 
tion within its lair or surrounding area to hear what is going on, 

Some dragons are able to communicate telepathies! I y with any intelli¬ 
gent creature. The percentage chance for a dragon to speak is based on its 
Intelligence and age category* Refer to individual descriptions for per¬ 
centages. 

Dragon Lairs: All dragon lairs are tar from mortal civilization, and they 
are difficult to find because the dragons lake careful measures to cloak 
their coming and going. There is usually little, if any, wildlife around the 
lairs because neighboring creatures fear the dragons, and most dragons 
eat the few creatures that are foolish enough to remain. 

When a young adult dragon leaves its parents in search oi its own lair, 
it spends a few years moving from place to place to find a cave or cavern 
which best suits its personality. In most cases, the dragons search for in¬ 
creasingly larger caves which can easily accommodate them as they 
grow. Usually by the lime a dragon has reached the mature adult stage, ii 
has selected a large lair it plans to keep for the remainder ol its life. A 
dragon at this stage has gathered a considerable amount of treasure and is 
loath to move it to a different location. 

The location and character of dragon lairs vary based on each sub¬ 
species; consult individual dragons for specific information. However, 
one thing remains constant any dragon considers its lair and neighboring 
areas its domains. A creat ure which violates or threatens the lair is threat¬ 
ening the dragon and will be dealt with harshly. Some good dragons may 
be more lenient than other subspecies in this matter. All dragons keep 
their treasure hidden deep within their lairs, and some dragons create 
hazardous conditions within their lain tn keep unwary creatures from 
reaching the treasure. 

Dragon Flight: Despite their large size, dragons are graceful and compe¬ 
tent fhers; most are maneuverability class C. This is due partially to their 
powerful wings, and partially to the dragon s innate magic Dragons can 
climb at half speed and dive at double speed, 

A dragon can change direction quickly by executing a wingover ma¬ 
neuver. A dragon cannot gain altitude during the round it executes a 
ivingover. but it may dive, The maneuver enables the dragon to make a 
turn of 120 to 240 degrees regardless of its speed or size.

Dragon, General 


Diving dragons can strike with their claws, with a +2 bonus to attack 
rolls. Dragons diving on land-bound opponents can also strike with both 
wings, but then must land immediately after attacking. 

When engaging other flying opponents, dragons can either daw or 
bite, but not both. An airborne dragon must glide to cast spells (but in¬ 
nate abilities can be used at any time) A gliding dragon loses 1.000 feet ot 
altitude per round, and its forward speed is equal to one half its flight 
speed on the round before it began gliding,

Dragon Fean Dragons can inspire panic or fear. The mere sight of a 
young adult or older dragon causes creatures with Fewer than 1 Hit Die 
i as well as all non carnivorous, nonaggressive creatures with fewer Hit 
Dice than the dragon) to automatically flee in panit for 4dG rounds. 

Trained war mounts, organized military units, and single creatures 
with 1 Hit Die or mare, but with fewer Hit Dice than the dragon are not 
panicked, but they may be stricken with fear if they are within the drag¬ 
ons fear aura, The aura surrounds attacking or charging dragons In the 
specified radius and in a path along the ground directly beneath a flying 
dragon whose altitude is 250 feet or less. Creatures not automatically 
panicked are entitled io saving throws vs petrification. Creatures failing 
their saving throws are stricken with fear and fight with a -2 penalty to 
their attack and damage rolls. The aura increases in size and power based 
on the age category of the dragon: creatures subjected to the aura receive 
a saving throw bonus or a penalty as specif ied on the Dragon Table. All 
creatures with Hit Dice equal to or greater than those of the dragon are 
immune to the fear effect. 

Gem dragons are not as inherently fearsome as other dragons, so sav¬ 
ing throws against their fear auras recei ve bonuses; the bonuses appear in 
parenthesis in the Dragon Table, 

Dragon Hit Die Modifier: Dragon Hit Dice vary between subspecies and 
are modified based on age category. Refer to individual dragon entries for 
the base Hit Dice for each species, and to the Dragon Table for the modi¬ 
fier based on age. The older a dragon gets, the more Hit Dice it has. For 
example, a black dragon has a base of 10 Hit Dice. A hatchling black 
dragon subtracts &amp; dice, giving it a total of 4. A great wyrm black dragon 
adds 3 dice for a total of IS. 

Dragons' saving throws are tied to their Hit Dice. Each dragon saves as 
a fighter equal in level to the dragon’s Hit Dice, For example, a hatchling 
black dragon saves as a 4th-level fighter, while a great wyrm black drag¬ 
on saver as an l&amp;th-level fighter. 

Dragon Combat Modifier A dragons combat modifier varies with age 
category. The bonus or penalty applies to damage rolls for each physical 
attack. It does not apply to a dragon's breath weapon. The combat modi¬ 
fier is also applied to the dragon s base spelleasting level (age category), 
to determine the actual level at which the dragon casts spells (thus, a great 
wyrm casts spells at 24th level of ability). 

Dragon Attacks: All dragons have a daw 'daw/bite attack form and a 
breath weapon. The latter can be used once every three rounds. Dragons 
also employ several other attack forms which are detailed in the follow¬ 
ing text. Dragons frequently divide their attacks between opponents us¬ 
ing the more dangerous attacks, such as the bite, against the foes they 
perceive to be the toughest. 

A dragons preferred attacks are usually, in order, breath weapon, 
magical abilities f.orspellsn and physical attacks. A dragon that breathes 
during a round of combat cannot also attack physically. Magical abilities 
I but not spells } can be used in addition to any attacks, except the breath 
weapon. 


CU ws: A dragon can use its claws to attack creatures lo its front and 
sides, If the dragon kicks with one rear leg, it can attack with only one 
daw (the other must be used to maintain balance). 

Bile: Because of a dragon's long neck, it can bite creatures to its back 
and sides. 

Snatch: Only young adult and older dragons can snatch. This occurs 
when a flying dragon dives and attempts to grab a creature in one of its 
daws. A creature struck by this method is taken into the air. There is a 
50% chance that a snatched creature has its arms pinned, and therefore 
cannot physically attack the dragon, Snatched creatures are sometimes 
taken to great heights and dropped. The snatched creature can be 
squeezed in the daw for automatic claw damage each round, or transfer¬ 
red to the dragons mouth (the transfer requires a successful attack roll), 
If the transfer succeeds, the victim automatically suffers bite damage each 
round: if it tails, the victim is dropped. Dragons of age old and older can 
carry a victim in each daw, and they can try to snatch two victims at 
once. Wyrtm and great wyrms can carry three victims, but one of the 
first two snatched must be transferred from daw to mouth before the 
third can be snatched. 

A dragon can snatch creatures two or more size categories smaller than 
itself. For example, a dragon that is 45' long is a Gargantuan creature, so 
the biggest creature it can snatch is a Large one (12' long), 

Plummet: If the DM chooses to allow plummets, an airborne dragon, 
or a dragon jumping and descending from at least 30 feet above a tar¬ 
get , can land on a victim. The dragon crushes and pins opponents using 
Its claws and tail, inflicting damage equal to its bite. The dragon can 
crush as many creatures as its combat modifier. The dragon rolls a sep¬ 
arate attack against each creature affected. Creatures that are missed 
are assumed to have escaped, Creatures that are crushed must mil suc¬ 
cessful saving throws vs. petrification or be pinned under the dragon, 
automatically suffering crushing damage during the next round unless 
the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, 
the victims must roll successful saving throws vs, petrification to get 
free. The dragons combat modifier applies as a penalty to all saving 
throw vs. the crash, A dragon cannot take any other actions when 
plummeting or pinning. 

Kick: Any dragon can kick creatures attacking it from behind, A kick 
delivers daw damage, and creatures struck must roll their Dexterity or 
less on ld2G or be kicked back ld6 feet, +1 foot per age category of the 
dragon. Those knocked back must make successful saving throws vs. pet¬ 
rification (adjusted by the dragon’s combat modifier) or fall. If the dragon 
attacks with one daw, it can kick with only one hind leg (the other must 
be used for balance). It cannot slap its tail while kicking. 

Wing Buffet: Young adult and older dragons can employ their wings in 
combat; targets must be at the dragon's sides. The damage inflicted is the 
same as a daw attack, and creatures struck must mil their Dexterity or 
Jess on ld20 or be knocked prone. 

Tail Sldp: Adult and older dragons can use their tails to attack creatures 
to their rear and sides. A tail attack inflicts the same damage as two daw 
attacks and affects as many targets as the dragons age category. The 
dragon rolls a separate attack against each creature. Creatures struck 
must roll successful saving throws vs, petrification \adjusted by the drag¬ 
on’s combat modifier) or be stunned for ld4 + 1 minutes. A tail slap can 
smash a light wooden structure and even damage a cube of force (one 
charge per two points of combat modifier, round down). 

Staih Any dragon flying near the ground can halt its forward motion 
and hover for one round; it must land immediately thereafter. Once 
stopped, the dragon can attack with its bite and all four legs. It can use its 
breath weapon instead, but this rarely happens since dragons can breathe 
on the wing. If a dragon stalls in an area with lots of trees or loose earth, 
the draft from its wings creates a dust cloud with the same radius as its 
fear aura. Creatures within the cloud are blinded, and no spell casting is 
possible. The dust lasts far one round 

Spells: Dragons learn spells haphazardly over the years The DM 
should randomly determine which spells any particular dragon knows. 
The dragon can cast each spell once per day. unless random determina¬ 
tion indicates the same spell mare than once, in which case the dragon 
can cast it more than once a day. Dragons to not use spell books or pray 
to deities; they simply sleep, concentrate when they awaken, and remem¬ 
ber their spells. Dragon spells have only a verbal component; the spells 
have a casting time of 1, regardless of level. Dragons cannot physically 
attack, use their breath weapon, use their magical abilities, or fly (except 
to glide) while casting a spell.

Black dragons are abusive, quick to anger, and resent intrusions of any 
kind. They like dismal surroundings, heavy vegetation, and prefer dark¬ 
ness to daylight. Although not as intelligent as other dragons, black drag¬ 
ons are instinctively cunning and malevolent. 

At birth, a black dragons scales are thin, small, and glossy. But as ihe drag¬ 
on ages, its scales become larger thicker and duller, which helps it camou¬ 
flage itself m swamps and marshes. Black dragons speak their own tongue, a 
tongue common to all evil dragons, and 10% of hatchling black dragons have 
an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to pos¬ 
sess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Slack dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their sur¬ 
roundings as cover. Their favorite targets are men, who they will some¬ 
times stalk for several minutes in an attempt to gauge their strength and 
wealth before attacking. Against a band of men or a formidable creature* 
older black dragons will use their special abilities first, so the very' forces 
of the marsh can weaken the targets before the dragon joins the (Fight. 
Black dragons will also use their breath weapon bef ore dosing m melee. 
When fighting in heavily vegetated swamps and marshes, black dragons 
attempt to stay in the water or along the ground; the numerous trees and 
leafy canopies limit their flying maneuverability. When faced with an op¬ 
ponent which poses too much of a threat, a black dragon will attempt to 
fly out ol sight, so it will not leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. 

Breath weapon special abilities: A black dragon s breath weapon is a 
wide stream of acid that extends 60 1 in a straight line from the dragon's 
head. AH creatures caught in this stream must save vs. breath weapon for 
half damage. A black dragon casts spells and uses its magical abilities at 
Sth levd, plus its combat modifier. 

Black dragons are bom with an innate mafer brat/ifttg ability and an 
immunity to acid As they age. they gain the following additional 
powers: 

Juvenile: darkness three times a day in a JO* radius per age category of the 
dragon. Aduft: corrupt water once a day. For every age category a dragon 
attains, it can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul, 



Inert, and unable to support animal file. When this ability is used against 
potions and elixirs, they become useless if they roll a 15 or better on ld20. 
Old: plant grotu/h once a day. Venerable: summon inserts once a day. 
Great wyrm: ehffmi reptiles three times a day. This operates as a charm 
mammals spell, but is applicable only to reptiles, 

Ha hitat/Society: Black dragons are found in swamps, marshes, rain for¬ 
ests, and jungles. They revel in a steamy environment where canopies of 
trees filter out most of the sunlight, swarms of insects fill the air. and 
stagnant moss-covered ponds lie in abundance. Black dragons are excel¬ 
lent swimmers and enjoy lurking in the gloomy depths of swamps and 
bogs. They also are graceful in flight; however, they prefer to fly at night 
when their great forms are hidden by the darkness of the sky. Black drag¬ 
ons are extremely selfish, and the majority of those encountered will be 
alone. When a family of black dragons is encountered, the adults will 
protect their young. However, if it appears the adults' lives are in jeop¬ 
ardy they will abandon their young to save themselves. 

They lair in large, damp caves and mullindwribered subterranean caverns. 
Older dragons are able to hide the entrance to their lairs wilh their plant 
growth ability, Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older black drag¬ 
ons sometimes capture and question humans, before killing them, to find out 
where stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins are kept. 

Ecology: Black dragons can eat almost anything, although they prefer 
to dine primarily or fish, mollusks, and other aquatic creatures. They are 
land of eels, especially the giant varieties. They also hunt tor red meat, 
but they like to iF pickle r it by letting it lie in pond? within their lair for 
days before eating it.

Blue dragons are extremely territorial and voracious. They love to spend 
lonjg hours preparing ambushes for herd animals and unwary travelers, 
and they spend equally long hours dwelling on their success and admiring 
their trophies. 

The size of a blue dragon s scales increases little as the dragon ages, 
although they do become thicker and harder. The scales vary in color 
from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, retaining a glossy finish 
through all of the dragons stages because the blowing desert sands polish 
them. This makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surround¬ 
ings, However, the dragons often conceal themselves, burrowing into the 
sand so only part of their heads are exposed. 

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air; usually flying in the daytime 
when temperatures are the highest Some blue dragons nearly match the color 
of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage in combat. 

Blue dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil 
dragons, and 12% of hatchling blue dragons have an ability to communi¬ 
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in¬ 
creases 5% per age category of the dragon 


Combat: Blue dragons prefer to fight from a distance so their opponents 
can dearly witness the full force of their breath weapon and so little or no 
threat is posed to themselves. Often blue dragons will attack from di¬ 
rectly above or will burrow beneath the sands until opponents come 
within 100 feet Oldm blue dragons will use their special abilities, such as 
JtafJudttflftwy terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and 
aid in their chances to surprise. Blue dragons will only run from a fight if 
they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly. 

Breath weapon special abilities; A blue dragons breath weapon is a 5 J 
wide bolt of lightning that streaks 100 r in a straight line from the dragon's 
mouth. AH creatures caught in this stream must save vs. breath weapon 
for half damage. Blue dragons cast spelts and use their magical abilities at 
7th level adjusted by their combat modifier. 

Blue dragons are born with an immunity to electricity. As they age, 
they gain the following additional powers; Young: create or destroy wa¬ 



ter three times per day. Juvenile: sound imitation at will Adult: dust devil 
once a day Old: ventriloquism once a day. Venerable: control winds once 
a day. Great wyrm: hallucinatory terrain once a day. 

Habitat Society: Blue dragons are found in deserts; arid, windswept 
plains, and hot, humid badlands. They enjoy the bleak terrain because 
there are few obstacles—only an occasional rock outcropping or dune— 
to interrupt the view of their territories. They spend hours looking out 
over their domains, watching for trespassers and admiring their property. 
Most of the blue dragons encountered will be alone because they do not 
want to share their territories with others. However, when a family is 
encountered the male dragon will attack ferociously, protecting his 
property—his mate and young. The female dragon also will join in the 
attack if the threat proves significant. 

Blue dragons' enemies are men, who kill the dragons for their skin and 
treasure, and brass dragons, which share the same environment, if a blue 
dragon discovers a brass dragon in the same region, it will not rest until 
the trespassing dragon is killed or driven away. 

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns in which they store their 
treasure. Although blue dragons will collect anything which looks valu¬ 
able, they are fond of gems—especially sapphires. 

Ecology: Blue dragons are able to consume nearly anything, and some¬ 
times are forced to cat snakes, lizards, and desert plants to help sate their 
great hunger. However, they arc particularly fond of herd animals, such 
as camels, and they will gorge themselves on caravans of the creatures 
which they cook with a lightning holt.

Green dragons are bad tempered, mean, cruel, and nude. They hate good¬ 
ness and good-aligned creatures. They love intrigue and seek to enslave 
other woodland creatures, killing those who cannot be controlled or in¬ 
timidated. 

A hatchling green dragon s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade 
of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow 
larger and become lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald and olive 
green, which helps It blend in with its wooded surroundings. A green 
dragon's scales never become as thick as other dragons', remaining 
smooth and flexible. 

Green dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common lo all evil 
dragons, and 12% of hatchling green dragons have an ability to commu¬ 
nicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in 
creases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combah Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking 
on creatures of any stee. If the target creature intrigues the dragon or appears 
to be difficult to deal with, the dragon will stalk the creature, using its envi¬ 
ronment for cover, until it determines the best time to strike and the most 
appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears formidable, the dragon will 
first attack with its breath weapon, magical abilities, and spells. However, if 
the target appears weak, the dragon will make its presence known quickly tor 
it enjoys evoking terror in its targets. When the dragon has tired of this game, 
it will bring down the creature using its physical attacks so the fight lasts 
longer and the creatures agony is prolonged, 

Sometimes, the dragon elects to control a creature, such as a human or 
demi-human through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons like to 
question men, especially adventurers, to leam more about their society, abili¬ 
ties. what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby 

Breath weapon special abilities: A green dragon's breath weapon is a cloud 

poisonous chlorine gas that is 50 J long, 40 r wide, and 30 feet high, Crea¬ 
tures within the cloud may save versus breath weapon for half damage. A 


Green Dragon 



green dragon casts its spells at 6th level, adjusted by its combat modifier. 
From birth, green dragons are immune to gasses. As they age, they 
gain the following additional powers: Juvenile: water breathing. Adult: 
suggestion once a day. Mature adult: witrjt wood three times a day Old: 
plant growth once a day. Very old: entangle once a day Wynn: pass with¬ 
out trace three times a day, 

Habital/Sodety: Green dragons are found in suh-tropiea] and temperate 
forests the older the forest and bigger the trees, the better. The sights and 
smells of the woods are pleasing to the dragon, and it considers the entire 
forest or woods Its territory, Sometimes the dragon will enter into a rela¬ 
tionship with other evil forest-dwelling creatures, which keep the dragon 
informed about what is going on in the forest and surrounding area in ex¬ 
change for their lives. If a green dragon lives in a forest on a hillside, it will 
seek to enslave hill giants, which the dragon considers its greatest enemy. A 
green dragon makes it$ lair im underground chambers far beneath its forest 
The majority of green dragons encountered will be alone. However, 
when a mated pair df dragons and their young are encountered, the fe¬ 
male will leap to the attack. The male will take the young lo a place of 
safety before joining ihe fight. The parents are extremely protective of 
their young, despite their evil nature, and will sacrifice their own lives to 
save their offspring. 

Ecology: Although green dragons have been known to eat practically 
anything, including shrubs and small trees when they are hungry enough, 
they especially prize elves. If the forest i$ on a hillside, hill giants will hunt 
the younger dragons, which they consider a delicacy.

Rod dragons are the most covetous and greedy of all dragons, forever 
seeking to increase their treasure hoards. They are obsessed with their 
wealth and memorize an inventory accurate to the last copper. They are 
exceptionally vain and self confident, considering Lhemselves superior 
not only to other dragons, but to all other life in genera]. 

When red dragons hatch, their small scales are a bright glossy scarlet. Be¬ 
cause of this, they can be quickly spotted by predators and men hunting for 
skins, so they are hidden m deep underground lairs and not permitted to ven¬ 
ture outside until toward the end of their young stage when their scales have 
turned a deeper red, the glossy texture has been replaced by a smooth, dull 
finish, and they are more able to take care of themselves. As the dragon con¬ 
tinues to age. the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal. 

Red dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil 
dragons, and 16% of hatchling red dragons have an ability to communi¬ 
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in¬ 
creases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat; Because red dragons are so confident, they never pause to ap¬ 
praise an adversary. When they notice a target they make a snap decision 
whether to attack, using one of many perfect" strategies worked out 
ahead of time in the solitude of their lairs. If the creature appears small 
and insignificant, such as an unarmored man, the dragon will land to 
attack with its claws and bite, not wanting to obliterate the creature with 
its breath weapon, as any treasure might be consumed by the flames. 
However, if a red dragon encounters a group of armored men. it will use 
its breath weapon special abilities, and spells £if it is old enough to have 
them) before landing. 

Brea t h wea p on/spc data bill t f es: A red dragon's breath weapon is a sear- 
ingconeof fire 90' long 5' wide at the dragon's mouth and 30' at the base. 
Creatures struck by the flames must save versus breath weapon for half 
damage, Red dragons cast spells at 9th level, adjusted by their combat 
modifiers. 



Red dragons are bom immune to fire. As they age. they gain the following 
additional powers Young: affect normal fires three times per day. Juvenile: 
pyrotedinics three times per day. Adult: heat metal once per day Old: sugges¬ 
tion once per day. Very old: hypnotism once per day. Venerable: detect gems, 
kind and number in a 100' radius three times a day. 

Habitat Society: Red dragons can be found on great hills or on soaring 
mountains. From a high perch they haughtily survey their territory, 
which they consider to be everything that can be seen from their position. 
They prefer to lair in large caves that extend deep into the earth. 

A red dragon enjoys Its own company, not associating with other crea¬ 
tures, or even other red dragons, unless the dragon's aims can be fur¬ 
thered, For example, some red dragons who have charm spells will order 
men to act as the dragon's eyes and ears, gathering information about 
nearby settlements and sources of treasure. When a red dragonss off¬ 
spring reach the young adult stage, they are ordered from the lair arid the 
surrounding territory, as they are viewed as competition. 

Red dragons are quick to fight all creatures which encroach on their 
territory, especially copper and silver dragons which sometimes share the 
same environment. They hate gold dragons above all else because they 
believe gold dragons are "'nearly* as powerful as themselves. 

Ecology: Red dragons are meat eaters, although they are capable of di¬ 
gesting almost anything. Their favorite food is a maiden of any human or 
demi-human race. Sometimes the dragons arc able to charm key villagers 
into regularly sacrificing maidens to them.

White dragons, the smallest and weakest of the evil dragons, are slow 
wit ted but efficient hunters. They are impulsive, vicious, and animalistic, 
tending to consider only the needs and emotions of the moment and hav¬ 
ing no foresight or regret. Despite their low intelligence, they are as 
greedy and evil as the other evil dragons. 

The scales of a hatchling white dragon are a mirror-Hke glistening 
white, which makes them virtually invisible against a snowy back¬ 
ground, As the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by the time it 
reaches the very old stage, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in 
with the white. 

White dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil 
dragons, and 7% of hatchling white dragons have an ability to communi¬ 
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in¬ 
creases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Regardless of a target's size, a white dragon's favorite method 
of attack is to use its breath weapon and special abilities before closing to 
melee. This tactic sometimes works to the dragons detriment, as it can 
exhaust its breath weapon on smaller prey and then be faced with a larger 
creature it must attack physically. If a white dragon is pursuing creatures 
in the water such as polar bears or seals, it will melee them in their el^- 
ment, fighting with its daws and bite, 


Breath weapon special abilities: A white dragon's breath weapon is a 
cone of frost 70* long 5’ wide at the dragon's mouth, and 25' wide at the 
base. Creatures caught in the blast may Save versus Breath Weapon for 
half damage. A white dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities 
at 5th level, plus its combat modifier. 

From their birth, white dragons are immune to cold. As they grow old¬ 
er, they gain the following additional abilities: Juvenile: ice walking, 
which allows the dragon to walk across ice as easily as creatures walk 
across flat, dry ground. Mature adult: gust of wind three times a day. 
Very old: wall of fog three times a day, this produces snow or hail rather 
than rain. Wynn: freezing fog three times a day. This obscures vision in a 



100' radius and causes frost to form, creating a thin layer of glare ice on 
the ground and on all surfaces within the radius. 

Ha bit at. Society: White dragons live in chilly or cold regions, preferring 
lands where the temperature rarely rises above freezing and ice and snow 
always cover the ground. When temperatures become too warm, the 
dragons become lethargic. White dragons bask in the frigid winds that 
whip over the landscape, and they wallow and play in deep snow banks. 

White dragons are lackadaisical parents. Although the young remain 
with the parents from hatchling to juvenile or young adult stage, they are 
not protected. Once a dragon passes from its hatchling stage, it must fend 
tor itself, learning how to hunt and defend itself by watching the parents. 

White dragons' Lairs are usually icey caves and deep subterranean 
chambers: they select caves that open away from the warming rays of the 
sun. White dragons store all of their treasure within their lair, and prefer 
keeping it in caverns coated in ice, which reflect the gems and coins and 
make the treasure appear even larger. They are fond of gems, especially 
diamonds, because they are pretty to look at. 

Ecology; Although white dragons, as all other dragons, are able to eat 
nearly anything, they are very particular and will consume only food 
which has been frozen. Usually after a dragon has killed a creature with 
its breath weapon it will fall to devouring it while the carcass Is still stiff 
and frigid. It will bury other kills in snow banks until they are suitably 
frozen. 

White dragons' natural enemies are frost giants who kill the dragons 
for food and armor and subdue them to use for guards and mounts.

Crystal dragons are the friendliest of the gem dragons, always curious 
about the world. Though they seldom seek out company, they willingly 
converse with visitors who do not try to steal from them. 

At birth, crystal dragons have glossy white scales As the dragons age. 
their scales become translucent. Moonlight and starlight cause their 
scales to luminesce, while bright sunlight lends them a dazzling brilliance 
which makes crystal dragons almost unbearable to look at 

Crystal dragons speak their own tongue and the tongue common to all 
gem dragons, and 10% of hatchling crystal dragons have an ability to 
communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this 
ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Crystal dragons greatly prefer conversation to combat, and of¬ 
ten use charm person early in any conversation. They do not initially 
hide, but if visitors become hostile, a crystal dragon will retreat immedi¬ 
ately to observe its enemies with Its special abilities, and plan an attack. 
Often, it uses its breath weapon first, to weaken and disorient enemies. 
Spells and other abilities are used as needed, with daws and bite a last 
resort.

glowing shards; the cone is 60 teet long, 5 feet wide at the dragons

throw vs breath weapon or be blinded by the dazzling shards for one 
turn per age level of the dragon. The shards shine as bright as daylight, 
and can be seen tor miles. Creatures within 60 leet must save vs breath 
weapon or be dazzled, incurring a penalty of - 2 to attack rolls for one 
turn per age level of the dragon. A crystal dragon casts spells and uses 
magical abilities at 5th level, plus its combat modifier. 

Crystal dragons are born immune to light-based attacks and normal 
cold, and able to casL charm person at will. As they age, they gain these 



additional powers: Juvenile: color spray three times a day. Mature adult: 
suggestion three times a day. Very old: fudtacufe once a day. This allows 
the dragon to enchanL one of its scales as a stone of good luck. The en¬ 
chantment lasts one hour per age category of the dragon. Such scales are 
given to friendly visitors, Wyrm: cortf red winds three Limes a day,

Emerald dragons are very curious, particularly about local history and 
customs, but prefer to only observe. They are the most paranoid of the 
gem dragons, and do not tike people get too close to their treasure. 

Emerald dragons have translucent green scales at birth, As they age, 
the seal® harden and take on many shades of green. They scintillate in 
the light, and the dragons hide seems to be in constant motion. 

Emerald dragons speak their own tongue and the tongue common to all 
gem dragons, and 14% of hatchling emerald dragons have an ability to 
communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this 
ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Emerald dragons usually set up traps and alarms around their 
lairs to warn them of visitors. They often hide from intruders, using spe¬ 
cial abilities to observe, and seldom come out to speak, If intruders attack 
or approach the dragons treasure, the dragon burrows underneath to 
surprise its victims, then use breath weapon and daws, seeking to quickly 
disable as many as it can. If faced with superior forces, the dragon re¬ 
treats, and will wait years for revenge if necessary. 

Breath weapon special abilities: An emerald dragons breath weapon is a 
loud, keening wail which sets up a sonic vibration affecting all creatures 
within 120 feet of the dragons mouth. Those in the area can save vs. 
breath weapons for half damage from the painful vibrations. Victims 
must make a second saving throw vs, breath weapon or be stunned, un¬ 
able to defend nr attack, for three rounds per age level of the dragon, plus 
ld4 rounds. Those who successfully save are deafened and disoriented 
instead, for a like amount of time, and at - 1 to attack rolls. Deafness 
does not protect one from vibratory damage, but pre-vents stunning or 
additional deafness. An emerald dragon casts spells and uses its magical 
abilities at 6 th level, plus its combat modifier, 



Emerald dragons are bom with an innate flame walk ability and an 
immunity to sound-based attacks As they age, they gain the following

While not actively hostile, sapphire dragons are miiitantly territorial and 
initially distrustful of anyone who approaches. 

These beautiful dragons range from light to dark blue, and sparkle in 
the light, even at birth. Sapphire dragons are often mistaken for blue 
dragons, unless someone recalls the latter's preferred arid environment. 

Sapphire dragons speak their own tongue and the tongue common to 
all gem dragons, and 16% of hatchling sapphire dragons have an ability 
to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this 
ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Sapphire dragons generally observe intruders before deciding 
what to do with them, unless known enemies such as draw or dwarves 
are present. If others are not actively hostile the dragon attempts conver¬ 
sation and spell use to determine their intentions and convince them to 
leave. If the dragon or its treasure is threatened, it attacks immediately 
with breath weapon spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics or other 
special abilities to escape if its life is in jeopardy. 

Breath weapon special abilities: This dragon s breath weapon is a cone of 
high-pitched, almost inaudible sound. 75 feet long, 5 feet wide at the 
dragon s mouth, and 25 feet wide at the base. Creatures caught by the 
blast can save vs. breath weapon for half damage from the sound's dis¬

affected by tear, fleeing the dragon in panic for two rounds per age level

gem dragons, and 12% of hatchling topaz dragons have an ability to 
communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this

versing to hide psiomc* or magic use. U intruders are hostile, or the drag¬

needed. They enjoy using teeth and claws, and usually save their breath 
weapon until wounded. The dragon may pretend to surrender to buy 
time, and retreats ii greatly threatened. It usually makes one or more 
false retreats, attempting to come back and attack with surprise. 

Breath weapon ’special abilities: This dragon s breath weapon is a cone of 
dehydration 70 feet long, 5 feet wide at the dragon s mouth and 25 feet

a saving throw vs. breath weapon for half damage from water loss. 
Those who Fail to save lose ld6*6 Strength points; those who succeed 
lose only ld6 Strength points. Curative spells less powerful than heal or 
regeneration are ineffective against Strength loss, although victims who 
are carefully nursed back to health recover 1 Strength point per day. Any 
creature reduced to a Strength of 0 or less dies instantly. A topaz dragon 
casts spells and uses magical abilities at 5th level, plus combat modifier.

Bras? dragons* aru great talkers, but not particularly good conversational¬ 
ists. They are egotistical and often boorish , They often have useful infor¬ 
mation, but will divulge it only after drifting off the subject many times 
and after hints that a gift would be appreciated. 

At birth, a brass dragon's scales are dull. Their color is a brassy, mot¬ 
tled brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy, un¬ 
til they reach a warm, burnished appearance. 

Combat: Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent 
creature tries to take its leave of a brass dragon without talking to it at 
length, she dragon might have a fit of pique and try to force a conversa¬ 
tion with suggestion or by giving the victim a dose of sleep gas. If the 
victim falls asleep it will awaken to find itself pinned under the dragon or 
buned to the neck in the sand until the dragon's thirst for small talk is 
slaked. Before melee, brass dragons create a cloud of dust with dust deni! 
or control winds, then charge or snatch. Brass dragons often use control 
temperature to create heat to discomfort their opponents. When faced 
with real danger, younger brass dragons will fly out of sight, then hide by 
burrowing. Older dragons spurn this ploy. 

Breath weapon special abilities; A brass dragon has two breath weap¬ 
ons: a cone of sleep gas 70‘ long, 5' wide at the dragons mouiin and 20' 
wide at its end: or a cloud of blistering desert heat 50' long, 40' wide, and 
20 r high. Creatures caught in the gas, regardless of Hit Dice or level, must 
save vs. breath weapon or fall asleep for 10 minutes per age level of the 
dragon. Creatures caught in the heat take damage, save vs, breath weap¬ 
on for half. A brass dragon casts its spells and uses Its magical abilities at 
6th level, plus its combat modifier. 

At birth, brass dragons can speak tcrfh animals freely, and are immune 
to fire and heat As they age, they gain the following additional powers: 

Young: create or destroy water three times a day Juvenile: dust devil once 
a day. Adult: suggestion once a day. Mature adult: control temperature 3 
times a day in a 10' radius per age level. Old: control winds once a day. 



Great wyrm: Summon dfinni once a week. The dragon usually asks the 
djinni to preform some service. Although the djinni serves willingly the 
dragon will order it into combat only in extreme circumstances, as the 
dragon would be dismayed and embarrassed if the djinni were killed. 

Habitat Society Brass dragons are found in arid, warm dimates: rang¬ 
ing from sandy deserts to dry steppes They love intense, dry heat and 
spend most of their time basking in the sun. They lair in high caves, pref¬ 
erably facing east where the sun can warm the rocks, and their territories 
always contain several spots where they can bask and trap unwary trav¬ 
elers into conversation* 

Brass dragons are very social They usually are on good terms with neigh¬ 
boring brass dragons and sphinxes. Brass dragons are dedicated parents. If 
their young arc attacked they will try to slay the enemy, using their heat 
breath weapons and taking full advantage of their own immunity. 

Because they share the same habitat, blue dragons are brass dragons' 
worst enemies. Brass dragons usually get the worst of a one-on-one con¬ 
frontation, mostly because of the longer reach of the blue dragons breath 
weapon. Because of this, brass dragons usually try to evade blue dragons 
until they can rally their neighbors for 3 mass attack. 

Ecology: Like other dragons, brass dragons can, and will, eat almost 
anything it the need arises. In practice, however, they eat very little. They 
are able to get nourishment from morning dew, a rare commodity in their 
habitat, and have been seen carefully lifting it off plants with their long 
tongues.

Bronze dragons are inquisitive and fond of humans and denit-humans. 
They enjoy polymdrphing into small friendly animals so they can unob¬ 
trusively observe humans and demi-humans, especially advenlurers- 
Bronze dragons thrive on simple challenges such as riddles and harmless 
contests. They are fascinated by warfare and will eagerly join an army if 
the cause is just and the pay is good. 

At birth, a bronze dragon's scales are yellow tinged with green, show^ 
ing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color 
deepens slowly changing to a rich bronze tone that gets darker as Lhe 
dragon ages. Dragons Irom the very old stage and on develop a blue- 
black tint to the edges of their scales, similar to a patina on ancient bronze 
armor or statues. 

Bronze dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good 
dragons, and 16% of hatchling bronze dragons have an ability to com¬ 
municate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability 
increases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Bronze dragons dislike killing creatures with animal intelli¬ 
gence and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food), or force them 
away with repubiort When confronted with intelligent opponents 
bronze dragons use their ESP ability to learn their opponents' intentions. 
When attacking they blind their opponents with wail of fog, then charge. 
Or. If they are flying, they will snatch opponents. When fighting under 
water, they use airy muter to maintain the effectiveness of their breath 
weapons, and to keep away purely aquatic opponents. Against boats or 
ships they summon a storm or use their tail slap to smash the vessels 
hulls. If the dragon is inclined to be lenient, seafaring opponents might 
merely find themselves becalmed, fog bound, or with broken masts. 

Breath weapon special abilities; A bronze dragon has two breath weap¬ 
ons: a stroke of Ughtnmg 100 r long and 5 r wide ora cloud of repulsion gas 
20' long. 30' wide, and 30' high. Creatures caught in the gas must save vs. 
breath weapon or move away from the dragon for two minutes per age 
level of the dragon, plus 1-6 minutes, Creatures caught in the lightning 



take damage, save vs. breath weapon for half, A bronze dragon casts its 
spells and uses its magical abilities at 6th level plus its combat modifier. 

At birth, bronze dragons have a mater breathing ability, can speak 
u&gt;ifb animals at will, and are immune to electricity. As they age, they gain 
lhe following additional powers: Young: create food and water and poly¬ 
morph self three times a day (Each change in form lasts until the dragon 
chooses a different form. Reverting to the dragon's normal form does not 
count as a change.) Juvenile: tun/J of fog once a day, Adult: ESP three 
times a day. Mature adult; airy xuafer three times a day in a 10' radius per 
age category of the dragon. Old: weather summoning once a day. 

Ha bi ta 1/Society: Bronze dragons like t o be near d eep fresh or salt water. 
They are good swimmers and often visit the depths to cool off or to hunt 
for pearls or treasure from sunken ships. They prefer caves that are acces¬ 
sible only from the water, but their lairs are always dry—they do not lay 
eggs, sleep, or store treasure under water. 

Bronze dragons are fond of sea mammals, especially dolphins and 
whales. These animals provide the dragons with a wealth of information 
on shipwrecks, which the dragons love to plunder, and detail the haunts 
of large sharks. Bronze dragons detest pirates, disabling or destroying 
their ships. 

Ecology; Bronze dragons eat aquatic plants and some varieties of sea¬ 
food, They especially prize of shark meat. They also dine on an occasion¬ 
al pearl and, like other dragons, can eat almost anything in a pinch. Evil 
amphibious sea creatures (particularly sahuaginl who can invade their 
air filled lairs, are their greatest ertemies.

Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke teller and Fiddlers, 
They are prideful and are not good losers, although they are reasonably 
good winners. They are particularly selfish and greedy for their align¬ 
ment, and have an almost neutral outlook where wealth is concerned. 

At birth, a copper dragon s scales have a ruddy brown color with a 
copper tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more 
coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by the time the dragon becomes a 
young adult. Beginning at the venerable stage, the dragons' scales pick up 
a green tint. 

Copper dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good 
dragons, and 14% of hatchling copper dragons have an ability to com¬ 
municate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability 
increases 5% per age category of the dragon 

Combat: Copper dragons like to taunt and annoy their opponents, hoping 
they will give up or become angry and act foolishly. Early in an encounter, a 
copper dragon will jump from one side of an opponent to another, landing on 
inaccessible or vertical stone surfaces. If there are no such places around a 
dragons lair, the dragon will create them ahead of time using stone shape, 
move earth and wall of stone. An angry copper dragon will mire its oppo¬ 
nents using rock fu mud, and will force victims who escape the mud, into it 
with kicks. Once opponents are trapped in the mud, the dragon will crush 
them with a wall of stone or snatch them and carry them aloft. When lighting 
airborne opponents, a dragon will draw its enemies into narrow, stony gorges 
where it can use its spider climb ability in an attempt to maneuver the enemy 
into colliding with the walls. 

Breath weapon.special abilities; A copper dragon s breath weapon is ei¬ 
ther a cloud of s/cnr gas 30 long, 20’ wide, and 20' high or a spurt of acid 
70' long and 5 r wide. Creatures caught in the gas must save vs. breath 
weapon or be slowed for three minutes per age level of the dragon. Crea¬ 
tures caught in the acid take damage, save vs, breath weapon for half. A 
copper dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 7th level, 
plus its combat modifier. 

At birth, copper dragons can spider climb (stone surfaces only) and are 



immune to acid, As they age, they gain the following additional powers: 
Young: neutralize poison three times a day. juvenile: stone shape twice a 
day. Adult: forge! once a day. Mature adult: rock to thud once a day. Old: 
mooc earth once a day. Great wyrm: tualJ of stone once a day. A copper 
dragon can jump 30 yards forward or sideways, reaching heights up to 
20 r at mid jump. They can jump 30' straight up, 

Habitat/Sodety: Copper dragons like dry, rocky uplands and moun¬ 
ts . They lair in narrow caves and often conceal the entrances using 
tr joe earth and stone shape. Within the lair, they construct twisting maz¬ 
es with open tops. These allow the dragons to fly or jump over intruders 
struggling through the mare. 

Copper dragons appreciate wit, and will usually leave good or neutral 
creatures alone if they can relate a joke, humorous story or riddle the 
dragon has not heard before. They quickly gei annoyed with creatures 
who don't laugh at their jokes or do not accept the dragons tricks and 
antics with good humor. 

Because Lhey often inhabit hills in sight of red dragons' lairs conflicts 
between the two subspecies often occur. Copper dragons usually run far 
cover until they can equal the odds. 

Ecology: Copper dragons are determined hunters, the good sport a 
hunt provides is at least as important as they food they get. They are 
known to eat almost anything, including metal ores. However, they prize 
giant scorpions and other large poisonous creatures (they say the venom 
sharpens their with The dragon's digestive system can handle the venom 
safely, although injected venoms affect them normally.

appointed quests to promote goodness, and are not easily distracted from 
them. They hate injustice and foul play A gold dragon frequently assumes

At birth, a gold dragon's scales are dark yeHow with golden metallic 
flecks. The flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult 
stage, the scales grow completely golden 

Gold dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good 
dragons, and 18% of hatchling gold dragons have an ability to communi¬ 
cate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in¬

bility, delayed blast fireball and maze. 

Breath weapon special abilities: A gold dragon has two breath weap¬ 
ons: a cone of fire 90' long, 5* wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30’ wide at 
the end or a cloud of potent chlorine gas 50' long, 40' wide, and 30' high. 
Creatures caught in either effect are entitled to a save versus breath weap¬ 
on for half damage.

a change, A gold dragon s natural form has wings. However, they some¬ 
times choose a wingless form to facilitate swimming, gaining the higher 
swimming rate listed above. A gold dragon in any w ingless form can fly 
at a speed of 6 (MC El 


Dragon, Metallic 



As they age, they gain the following additional powers- Young: bless three 
times a day Juvenile: detect lie three times a day. Adult: mtimal summoning

the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10’ radius per 
age category of the dragon receives a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws and 
similar dice rolls, cf. sfone of good luck. If the dragon gives a gem to 
another creature only the bearer gets the bonus. The enchantment lasts 
three hours per age category of the dragon, plus 1-3 hours. The enchant¬ 
ment ends if the gem is destroyed before its duration expires. 

Habitat Society: Gold dragons can live anywhere. Their lairs are se¬ 
cluded and always made of solid stone, either caves or castles. These usu¬ 
ally have loyal guards: either animals appropriate to the terrain, or storm 
or good cloud giants. The giants usually serve as guards through a mutu¬ 
al defensive agreement. 

Ecology; Gold dragons can eat almost anything, however, they usually 
sustain themselves on pearls or small gems, Gold dragons who receive 
pearls and gems from good or neutral creatures will usually be favorably 
inclined toward the gift bringers, as long as the gift is not presented as a 
crass bribe. In the latter case, the dragon will accept the gift, but react 
cynically to any requests the giver makes,

Silver dragons are kind and helpful. They will cheerfully assist good crea¬ 
tures if their need is genuine. They often take the forms of kindly old men 
or fair damsels when associating with people. 

At birth, a silver dragon s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As 
the dragon approaches adulthood* its color slowly lightens to brightly 
gleaming silver. An adult or older silver dragon has scales so fine that the 
individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look 
as if they have been sculpted from pure metal. 

Silver dragons speak their own longue, a tongue common to all good 
dragons r and 16% of hatchling silver dragons have an ability to commu¬ 
nicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability in¬ 
creases 5% per age category of the dragon. 

Combat: Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when 
faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use feat her fall 
to stop any missiles fired at them. They use teal! of fog or control weather 
to blind or confuse opponents before making melee attacks. If angry, they 
will use reverse gravity to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they 
can be snatched. When Faced with flying opponents, a silver dragon will 
hide in clouds (often creating some with control weather on dear days!, 
remain there using cloud walking, then jump to the attack when they 
have the advantage. 

Breath Weapon Special Abilities; A silver dragon has two breath weap¬ 
ons; a corn* of cold 80' long. S' wide at the dragon's mouth, and 30' wide 
at the end or a cloud of paralyzation gas 50' long, 40' wide, and 20' high. 
Creatures caught in the gas must save versus breath weapon or become 
paralyzed for one minute per age level of the dragon, plus 145 minutes, 
Creatures caught in the cold are allowed a save versus breath weapon for 
half damage. A silver dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities 
at 6th level, plus its combat modifier. 



At birth, silver dragons are immune tu cold, and can polymorph self three 
times a day. Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a different 
form and reverting to their normal form does not count as a change. They 
also can thud umlk, This allows the dragon to tread on clouds or fog as 
though Ihey were solid ground. The ability functions continuously but can be 
negated or resumed at will As they age, they gain the following additional 
powers: Young: feather fall twice a day. juvenile wall of fog once a day. 
Adult; control winds three times a day. Mature adult: con fro/ weather once a 
day Old: reverse gravity once a day* 


Habitat Society: Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain 
peaks, or amid the clouds themselves, When they lair in clouds there al¬ 
ways will be an enchanted area with a solid floor for laying eggs and 
storing treasure. 

Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and often have 
mortal companions, Frequently they share deep friendships with mortals. 
Inevitably, however, the dragon reveals its true Form and lakes its leave 
to live a dragon s life for a time, 

Ecology; Silver dragons prefer human food, and can live on such fare 
indefinitely. 

Because they lair In simHar territories, silver dragons come into conflict 
with red dragons. Duels between the two species are furious and deadly, 
but silver dragons generally get the upper hand since they are more capa¬ 
ble of working together against their foes and often have human allies.

Brown dragons, also known as great desert dragons, migrated from the 
desert Raurirt and now frequent much of the wastes in Eastern 
Mulhorand. Brown dragons are ferocious beasts; while they are rnteili- 
gent, they view human beings as food, and believe It peculiar to talk with 
one's meal. They do not have wings and cannot fly, 

Brown dragons have a col oration similar to that of desert sands, rang¬ 
ing from dim brown at hatchling stage to almost white at great wyrm 
stage. They have small, webbed daws that are well developed for dig¬ 
ging, and very large, long mouths. Their scales are leathery and not as 
hard as other dragon armors. 

Brown dragons speak their own tongue and the language of blue drag' 
ons. They have a 5% chance per age category of being able to communi¬ 
cate with any intelligent creature. 

Combat: Brown dragons prefer to dig deep trenches in the sand and wait 
for prey to appear so they may ambush them. They have a 90% chance of 
hearing a man-sized creature's footsteps on the desert sands from as far 
down as 500 feet. 

Brown dragons breach the desert sand with incredible silence, impos¬ 
ing a - 5 penalty to opponents surprise rolls. Older brown dragons use 
illusions or even invisibility spells to conceal themselves. 

When brown dragons grab their prey, they hold it in their law?, l ahing 
it to their lairs to be eaten when it is most convenient. 

The brown dragons breath weapon is a powerful acid, which it spews 
in a 5-foot-wide spray that extends in a straight line from the dragon's 
head up to 60 feet. All creatures caught in the spray can roll a saving 
throw vs, breath weapon for half damage. 

Brown dragons use the spray against large numbers but not against 
mounted foes, since they know that horses are good eating and don't put 
up as much struggle as humans. Brown dragons cast spells as Sth-level 
wizards. 



They are bom immune tn acid and the effects of the desert heat. They 
may survive in airless environments nearly indefinitely. 

As they age, brown dragons gain the following abilities- 


Age

Juvenile 

Adult

Abilities 

Cast creme sand to cover up their burrows 
Cast create water once per day 
Cast sandstorm (MuJhorandi spell) once per day 
Can summon a I2-HD earth elemental 
Cast disintegrate once per day 


Ha bit at’ Society; Brown dragons are found in deserts, often close to set¬ 
tled areas. They typically dwell in deep burrows nearly 1,000 feet be¬ 
neath the sand, where they carve out vast chambers. 

The brown dragon mates and raises a family for only a short period of 
time; all parents encountered are in the mature adult stage of develop¬ 
ment. Many brown dragons do not mate. 

Man is the main enemy of brown dragons. Humans hunt them for their 
hides and treasure. Blue dragons also attack brown dragons. 

Battles between brown and blue dragons are legendary for their feroci¬ 
ty The people of the desert have a curious respect for the brown dragon, 
so tales often make the blue dragons more evil than the brown. 


Ecology: Brown dragons are able to digest sand and other min- era! mate¬ 
rials to sustain themselves over long periods of rime, However, meat is 
the preferred diet, with horseflesh being a particular favorite.

Cloud dragons are reclusive creatures that dislike intrusions. They rarely 
converse, but if persuaded to do so they tend to be taciturn and aloof 
They have no respect whatsoever for creatures that cannot fly without 
assistance from spells or devices. 

At birth, cloud dragons have silver-white scales tinged with red at the 
edges. As they grow, the red spreads and lightens to sunset orange. At the 
mature adult stage and above, the red~orange color deepens to red gold 
and almost entirely replaces the silver. 

Cloud dragons speak their own tongue and a tongue common to all 
neutral dragons. Also, 17% of hatchling cloud dragons can speak with 
any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% 
per age category. 

Combat: Cloud dragons are as likely to avoid combat (by assuming 
cloud form) as they are to attack. When attacking, they use their breath 
weapon to scatter foes, then cast solid fog and use their weather manipu¬ 
lation abilities to blind and disorient their foes. When very angry they 
conjure storms with control weather spells, then they call lightning. They 
like to use slmkmg doud and control Winds spells against flying oppo¬ 
nents. 

Breath Weapon Special Abilities A doud dragon's breath weapon is an ley 
blast of air that is 140 feel long, 30 feet high, and 30 feet wide. Creatures 
caught in the blast suffer damage from cold and flying ice crystals. Further¬ 
more. all creatures three size classes or more smaller than the dragon are 
blown head over heels for 2dl2 feet, plus 3 feet per age category of the drag¬ 
on . Character? who can grab solid objects won t be carried away unless they 
fail Strength checks: creatures with claws, suction cups, etc,, can avoid the 
effect if they have a suitable surface to cling to, 

A cloud dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 6th level 
plus its combat modifier. 

Cloud dragons are immune to cold. 

They can assume (or leave) a cohesive, cloud-like form at will, once 



per round. In this form, they are 75% unlikely to be distinguished from 
normal douds; when in cloud form, their Armor Class improves by “3 
and their magic resistance increases by 15%. Cloud dragons can use their 
spells and innate abilities while in cloud form, but they cannot attack 
physically or use iheir breath weapon, tn cloud form, cloud dragons fly 
at a speed of 12 IMG: A). 

As they age, doud dragons gain the following additional powers: Very 
yoLingr solid fog twice a day. Young: stinking cloud twice a day. Juvenile: 
create water twice a day (affects a maximum of three cubic yards (81 cu¬ 
bic feet 1) Adult; abscurement three times a day, Mature adult: call light¬ 
ning twice a day. Old: weather summoning twice a day. Very old: control 
weather twice a day. Ancient: control winds twice a day. 

Habitat'Soriety; Cloud dragons lair in magical doud islands where 
there is at least a small, solid floor for laying eggs and storing treasure. 
Very rarely, they occupy cloud-shrouded mountain peaks 

Cloud dragons are solitary 95% of the time, Jf more than one is en¬ 
countered it is a single parent with offspring. 

Ecology: Like all dragons, doud dragons can eat just aboui anything 
They seem to subsist primarily on rain water, hailstones and the occa¬ 
sional bit of silver. 

Because they inhabit in similar territories, doud dragons come into 
conflict with silver dragons. Despite their higher intelligence, cloud drag¬ 
ons usually lose such confrontations because of the silver dragons' sec¬ 
ondary breath weapons and ability to muster allies.

Deep dragons are little known on the surface world. They are the hunters 
of the Underdark. Cunning and patient, they place their survival, fol¬ 
lowed by their joy of hunting, above ail else. Deep dragons carefully 
amass and hide treasure in various caches, guarded with traps and magic. 
They are able to use most magical items. 

Deep dragons are an iridescent maroon when they hatch, soil- scaled, 
and unable to change form. They keep to their birth-lair until they have 
mastered both of their other iorms-a giant winged worm or snake and a 
human (or drew) form. 

Combat: Deep dragons burrow and tight with powerful, stone- rending 
daws. They love to fight and hunt prey through the lightless caverns of 
the Underdark, employing their various forms. In snake form, they are 
AC 6. MV 9, H 4(D), Sw 11. losing daw attacks, but gaining a constric¬ 
tion attack (attack roll required, inflicts 3d8 points of damage per round 
hampers movement spellcasting, and causes -1 on attack rolls and a 1- 
point AC penalty). 

In human form, a deep dragon is AC 10, MV 12, Sw 12, and causes 
damage by spell or weapon type. Armor can be worn, but it Is always 
destroyed (inflicting 2d4 points of damage to the dragon) in any transfor¬ 
mation of shape. A deep dragon can alter its features to resemble any 
humanoid of roughly human size. It is 66% likely to copy a specific being 
well enough to be mistaken for the actual creature, 

A deep dragon s breath weapon is a cone of Hesh-cmrosive gas 50 feet 
long, 40 feet wide, and 30 feet high. Creatures m the cloud can save vs, 
breath weapon for half damage (if they have dry, exposed skin, they save 
against the flesh-eating gas at -2). Goth, metal, and wood are not affect¬ 
ed. Leather is treated as dry, exposed skin. 

Deep dragons cast spells at oth level, adjusted by their combat modi¬ 
fiers. They are bom with ini revision, true seeing, and unerring detect 
magic abilities, and immunities to charm, sleep, and hold magic Deep 
dragons are Immune to extremes ot heat and cold (-3 on each die of daim 
age taken, to a minimum of 1 hp per die). 



As deep dragons age, they gain the following additional powers:

Habitat Society: Deep dragons mam the Underdark and are great explor¬ 
ers. Most often deep dragons are found in well- defended lairs in the 
Underdark. They often use their powers to reach caverns inaccessible to 
most creatures. Deep dragons often work with drew. 


Ecology: Deep dragons have been known to eat almost anything, but 
they particularly prize the flesh of clams, fish, kuo-toa, and abdeth. 
They view cloakers and mind flayers as dangerous rivals in the Under¬ 
dark. Deep dragons avoid confrontations with other dragons and never 
fight or steal from others of their own kind.

Mercury dragons are fast, h igh I y-maneuverable creatures with relatively 
small bodies and long tails. Although good in alignment, they are very 
whimsical, making and changing decisions frequently 

At birth, a mercury dragon's scales are dull silver. As it ages, the scales 
become brighter and brighter,, until at adult age they gain a brilliant mir¬ 
ror finish. Sunlight or other sources of light reflecting off the scales and 
wings of a mercury dragon can be blinding. 

Mercuries speak the language of good dragons, but at high speed, so 
there’s only a 75% chance of understanding a mercury dragon. 

Combat: Mercury dragons are as unpredictable when II comes to combat 
as they are in any other situation. They may parley they might attack 
Instantly, or. perhaps they may avoid combat entirely. They never at¬ 
tack good-aligned creatures unless sorely provoked. 

Mercury dragons always use spells in combat, if possible. They are 
very creative, and can always figure out some innovative way of using 
virtually any spell to advantage in combat. 

In addition to the breath weapon and the attack modes shared by ail 
dragons,* mercury dragons can curve the mirror-bright membranes of 
their wings to reflect and concentrate available light (as dim as full moon¬ 
light) into a beam of darling brightness. They can aim the beam at one 
enemy per round-at the expense of not being able to use their wing buffet, 
and the enemy must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be blinded 
for ld4 +1 rounds. It not using this technique as a weapon, they can use 
the beam much like a search-light. 

A mercury dragon s breath weapon is a beam of brilliant, yellow light. 
The beam is 5 feet wide and extends 60 feet from the creatures mouth 
Any creature caught in the beam receives damage from heat (saving 
throw for half damage). The heat ol the beam is Intense enough to ignite 
flammable objects that fail saving throws vs, magical fire, 

A mercury dragon casts spells and uses magical abilities al the 10th 



level, plus its combat modifier. At birth, mercury dragons are immune to 
fire and alt magical forms of blindness. 

They also receive a + 3 bonus to saving throws against light-based 
attacks. As they age, they gain the following additional powers: 


Age- 

Abilities 

Young 

gaze reflection at will 

Juvenile 

mirror image three times per day 

Adult 

self twice per day 

Old 

telekinesis twice per day 

Wynn 

project image once per day 


Habitat Society: Mercury dragons are loners by nature, Their mating be¬ 
havior is free-wheeling, fun loving, and generally irresponsible. If a te¬ 
rn ah? becomes impregnated however, the male s protective instincts take 
over. Mercuries are very protective of their offspring, and will give their 
lives io save them. Offspring usually stay with their parents until they 
reach the juvenile age category. 

Because of their unpredictable, sometimes almost irrational nature, 
mercuries very rarely have dose relationships with other creatures in the 
area. For this reason, mercuries have to depend on magical and mechani¬ 
cal traps and guards to protect their lairs when they arc away. 

Ecology: Mercury dragons eat anything, but they prefer to feed on metal 
ores, Although they have no venom attacks, the flesh of mercury dragons 
is highly poisonous.

Mist dragons are solitary and philosophical. Their favorite activity is 
sitting quietly arid thinking. They hate being disturbed and dislike 
conversation. 

At birth, a mist dragon s scales are shiny blue-white. As the dragon 
ages, the scales darken, becoming blue-gray with metallic silver flecks 
that sparkle in sunlight. 

Mist dragons speak their own tongue and a tongue common to all 
neutral dragons. Also. 15% of hatchling mist dragons can speak with any 
intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per 
age category'. 

Combat: Mist dragons try to avoid encounters by assuming mist form. 
In combat, they quickly use their breath weapons, then assume mist form 
and hide in the vapor—where they launch a spell assault 

Breath Weapon/Special Abilities; A mist dragon's breath weapon is a 
doud of scalding vapor that is 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. 
Creatures caught In vapor suffer can roll saving throws vs. breath 
weapon tor half damage. In still air, the vapor persists for idi +4 rounds: 
on the second round, it condenses into a clammy, smothering fog that 
blinds air-breathing creatures for ld4 rounds and inflicts 3d4 points of 
drowning damage per round for as long as the creature remains in Lhe 
cloud ta successful saving throw vs. breath weapon negates both effects}. 

A mist dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at oth level 
plus its combat modifier 

Mist dragons are immune to fire and heat. 

Mist dragons can assume (or leave) a cohesive, mist-like form at will, once 
per round. In this form, they are 75% unlikely to be distinguished from 
normal mist- in mist form, their Armor Gass improves by ~3 and their 
magic resistance increases by 15% They can use their spells and innate 
abilities while in mist form, but they cannot attack physically or use their 
breath weapon. Mist dragons in mist form can fly at a speed of 9 (MC: A). 



As they age, they gain the following additional powers: Very young: 
iffrfer breathing twice a day. Young: tuofl of fog twice a day. Juvenile: 
create water twice a day (affects a maximum of three cubic yards [81 
cubic feet |). Adult: control winds three times a day. Mature adult; wind 
wa!/ twice a day. Old: solid fog twice a day. Very old; predict weather 
twice a day. Ancient: airy usurer twice a day. 

Habitat/Society; Mist dragons live near waterfalls, rapids, coastlines, 
or where rainfall is frequent and heavy. Their lairs are usually large 
natural caverns or grottoes that are mist-filled and damp, Forest-dwelling 
mist dragons occasionally come into conflict with green dragons. Mist 
dragons greatly resent the green dragons' attempts to intimidate or 
dominate them: they usually spend several months vainly trying to avoid 
a green dragons advances before losing all patience and launch mg an 
all-out campaign to destroy or drive away the aggressor. Likewise, 
coastal mist dragons might have bronze dragons for neighbors. This, 
however, seldom leads Lo conflict as both dragons are content to leave the 
others alone. 

Mist dragons are loners, and 90% of all encounters are with 
individuals. Group encounters are with parents and offspring. 

Ecology: Mist dragons can eat almost anything, including woody 
plants and even mud. However, they draw most of their sustenance 
directly from natural mist or spray They often lie in misty or foggy 
places, thinking and basking in the moisture,

Shadow dragons are sly and devious. They are instinctively cunning and 
are not prone to taking risks. 

At all ages, a shadow dragon s scales and body are translucent, so that 
when viewed from a distance it appears to be a mass of shadows. 

Shadow dragons speak their own tongue and a tongue common to all 
evil dragons. Also, 17% of hatchling shadow dragons can speak with any 
intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per 
age category. 

Combat: Shadow dragons prefer to attack from hiding, usually 
employing invisibility or hiding in shadows. They use illusion/phantasm 
spells to contuse and misdirect foes. Older dragons are especially fond of 
their non-detection ability 

Breath Weapon 1 Special Abilities: A shadow dragon s breath weapon is 
a cloud oF blackness that is 40 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 20 feet high, 
Creatures caught in the doud are blinded for one melee round and lose -V* 
(round up) of their life energy (levels or Hit Dice): a successful saving 
throw vs, breath weapon reduces the loss to Va (round up). The life 
energy loss persists for a variable number of turns, shown on the table 
above. Negative plane protect inn spells prevent this life energy loss. 

A character who is reduced to Oor fewer levels lapses into a coma for 
the duration of the cloud’s effect, 

A shadow dragon casts spells and uses iis magical abilities at 6th level 
plus its combat modifier. 

Shadow dragons are bom immune to energy draining and with the 
ability to hide in shadows with 40% chance of success: this ability 
increases 5% per age category to a maximum of 93%. 

As they age, they gain the following additional powers: Juvenile; 
mirror image three times a day (id4 + l images]. Adult: dimension door 
twice a day. Old: non-defection three times a day Venerable; shadow 
walk once a day. Great wyrm: crept? shadows three times a day. (This 
ability creates a mass of leaping shadows with a radius of 100 yards, 



duration one hour, All magical [and normal | light and darkness sources 
are negated for as long as they remain in the radius. Creatures able to 
hide in shadows can do so in these magical shadows even if under direct 
observation. Shadow dragons and other creatures from the plane of 
Shadow can move and attack normally while hiding in these shadows, 
effectively giving them improved invisibility A successful dispel magic 
spell banishes the shadows,) 

HabltalSoriety; Shadow dragons hate both bright light and total 
darkness, preferring variegated lighting with patches of diffuse lighE and 
deep, inky shadows. On the Prime Material plane, their lairs arc always 
places Lhal provide shadowy light for most of the day They prefer 
ancient ruins, where they can hide underground when the sun is bright 
and still find shadows above ground during dawn and twilight. In the 
plane of Shadow, they live in dense thickets of trees and brambles, 
fortified castles, or labyrinthine caves. In either plane, they prefer to 
locate their lairs near colonies of other creatures that can alert them to 
potential foes or victims. The dragons seldom actually cooperate with 
these allies, however, though the dragons commonly prey on them. 

Shadow dragons love dark-colored, opaque gems, and especially prize 
black stones, They also collect magical items that produce shadows or 
darkness, They use these items to turn areas filled with total darkness or 
light into masses of shadows. 

Ecology: Shadow dragons eat almost anything. Their favorite food is 
rutting carrion, though they often kill for sport. Slain victims are left to 
decay until they become suitably foul. These dragons are equally fond of 
frost-killed, waterlogged, or salt-poisoned plants,

Sled dragons love to have human and demihuman companions, and they 
prefer to live amid the hustle and bustle of great cities. They often pose as 
sages, scholars, mages, or other intellectuals. 

At birth a steel dragon's scales are deep blue-gray with steely high¬ 
lights, As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly lightens to 
that of lustrous burnished steel. When these dragons take on human 
form, they always have one steel-gray feature-hair, eyes, nails, or same- 
times a ring or other ornament. 

Steel dragons speak their own tongue and a tongue common to all neu¬ 
tral dragons. Also, 19% of hatchling steel dragons can speak with arty 
intelligent creature. This chance increases by 5% per age category. 

Combat: Steel dragons favor repartee over combat. If pressed, they usu¬ 
ally begin with a spelt assault and avoid melee. If seriously harmed or 
threatened, they resume dragon form and use their breath weapons. They 
breathe on any foe they plan to engage in melee, and they seek to keep 
their foes within the cloud until the gas loses its potency. 

A steel dragon's breath weapon is a cube of toxic gas. The dragon con 
monitor the amount of gas released so closely that it can make the cube as 
small as it wishes or as large as shown in the table below (the a side of the 
cube), Creatures caught in the gas must roll successful saving throws vs. 
poison with a -2 penalty or die instantly. The gas is quickly absorbed 
through the skin and is fust as lethal if inhaled. Coating all exposed skin 
with lard or grease offers some protection (saving throw penalty ne¬ 
gated). Victims who succeed with the save suffer the indicated amount of 
damage. In still air, the gas stays active for two melee rounds. Steel drag¬ 
ons are immune to all poi&amp;ons. 

A steel dragon tan polymorph self five times a day Each change in 
form lasts until the dragon chooses a different form. Reverting to the 
dragon's normal form does not count as a change. 

Steel dragons are immune to wizard spells of 1st to 4th levels and cast 



spells and use their special abilities at 8th level, plus their combat modi 
fier, As they age, they gain the following additional powers: 


Age 

Young 

Juvenile 

Adult 

Mature adult 
Old 


Abilities

friends once a day 
charm person three times a day 
suggestion once a day 
enthrall once a day 


Habitat-Society: Steel dragons prefer human lodgings that are well 
equipped with strung rooms or vaults to protect their treasures, 

Steel dragons prefer human form to their own, and they always have 
mortal companions. They are endlessly curious about human and derm- 
human art, culture, history and politics. They always keep their true na¬ 
ture secret, but they are able to recognize each other. 


Ecology; Steel dragons prefer human food. Unlike other form shifting 
dragons, I hey cannot Hve on such fare indefinitely, as they must eat 
enough to maintain their true bulk. Once or twice a month, they leave 
their adopted cities and go into the wilderness to hunt for tood, They 
explain their absences in a way consistent with their human identities 
Steel dragons hate chaotic creatures who seek to disrupt life in cities or 
despoil their hunting grounds. In the city the dragons never hesitate to 
report troublemakers or to use their special abilities to hunt down crimi¬ 
nals, Ln the wilderness, they prefer swifter forms of justice.

Although the existence of yellow dragons has tong been predicted by 
sages (based on theories oi primary colors), the first specimen was spot¬ 
ted only five or so years ago. The creatures are solitary and secretive, 
preferring to lay in wait for prey to stumble into carefully-prepared traps 
instead of hunting actively. 

At birth, yellows have soft, tan scales. As they grow older, the scales 
harden and become lighter in color, eventually reaching the grayish yel¬ 
low of desert sands. Their scales always have a dusty texture to them, 
giving them a finish lhat does not reflect light well. Even their teeth and 
daws have a similar finish. No part of the ydlow dragon will glint in the 
sunlight, thereby giving away its position. 

Yellow dragons speak their own tongue, which is quite different than 
that spoken by other evil dragons. Yellows have no interest in speaking 
with other races, and so they learn no other languages. 

Combat; Although preferring guile to combat and ambush to attack, yel¬ 
lows are fierce and cunning fighters. Even if forced into a situation where 
direct combat is inevitable, theyll still use their spells and innate abilities 
so as to mislead, misdirect, and distract their opponents. 

A favorite hunting tactic for a yellow is to dig a steep-walled, cone- 
shaped depression in the sand, and then bury itself at the bottom oF this 
arater with just its eyes and nostrils showing. When a creature stumbles 
into the depression, the dragon moves its wings in the sand, causing the 
steep walls of the cone to collapse and drawing the prey sLraighL to the 
dragon's mouth. A yellow dragon casts spells and uses magical abilities at 
Sth level, plus its combat modifier. 

A yellow dragon s breath weapon is a high-velocity blast of scorching 
air mixed with sand. This affects an area 50 feet long. 40 feet wide, and 20 
feet high. Creatures caught within this blast must roll successful saving 
throws vs. breath weapon for half damage. Regardless of the outcome of 
this roll, they must make another saving throw vs, breath weapon. Fail¬ 
ure means that the abrasive sand m the breath blast has damaged their 
eyes, blinding them for ld4 + 1 rounds 



Yellow dragons are immune to fire and heat and can cast silence, IQ 1 
radius at will. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:

Abilities 

Young 

create or destroy water three times per day 

Juvenile

Adult 

improved invisibility twice per day 

Old

Wynn 

enemaffcm three times* per day 


HabiUt/Sodety: Yellow dragons love deserts, preferring areas of sandy 
windswept desolation. They are most comfortable in daytime tempera¬ 
tures of 105 degrees and up. although they can easily survive subf reeling 
temperatures at night. They share much the same territory as brasses: 
thus the species occasionally come into conflict 

Yellows are solitary, selfish creatures that form no dose bonds with any 
other creature, including other yellows. They are highly territorial; the 
only time they'd let another yellow into thek territory' is to mate, which is 
actually quite rare. Immediately afterward, the dragons separate The 
mother raises the offspring, but won t go out of her way to protect them 
from attackers. The young dragons usually leave home before they reach 
the juvenile age category. The main enemies of yellow dragons are brass¬ 
es. which actively hunt the smaller creatures. 

Ecology: Although able to eat anything, yellows favor fresh meat. 
(Demi)humans are considered a delicacy, as are the unhatched eggs of 
brass dragons, (Yellows rarely get to enjoy this latter feast J

Dragon turtles are one of the most beautiful, awesome, and feared 
creatures of the water. With their deadly jaws and breath weapon, and 
their penchant for capsizing ships, dragon turtles are dreaded by mari¬ 
ners on large bodies of water, both fresh and salt. 

When a dragon turtle surfaces, it is sometimes mistaken for the reflec¬ 
tion of the sun or moon on the water. The turtle's rough, deep green shell 
is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the 
silver highlights that line the shell are patterned like light dancing on 
open water. The turtles legs and tail are of a lighter green, and they are 
flecked with golden highlights. The coloration of the creatures head is 
similar to the legs and tail, but its crest spines are golden with dark green 
webbing connecting them. A dragon turtles shell can reach to 30 feet in 
diameter, and an adult turtle can measure over 40 feet from its snout to 
the tip of its tail. Dragon turtles speak their own highly-developed lan¬ 
guage. 


Combat; Though dragon turtles may be mistaken for the pleasant 
sight of light glinting off of water that illusion is never maintained for 
long, Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and will generally attack any 
creature that threatens its territory or presents itself as a potential meal, 
in combat, dragon turtles will usually (90% \ attack with their formida¬ 
ble daws and teeth first. Its shell provides the turtle with excellent pro¬ 
tection. though once the dragon turtle strikes a victim, it rarely needs 
to rely upon this safeguard. 

The dragon turtles shell also provides the creature with a weapon 
to attack ships that foolishly pass through its territory uninvited. 
Sinking as deep as necessary, the dragon turtle will wait for the ship 
to pass over tt and then rise up underneath the vessel, using all of its 
considerable bulk to capsize the unlucky target. Ships under 20 feet 
in length will be capsized by this attack 95% of the time, vessels from 
20 to 60 feet long will be capsized 50% of the time, and ships over 60 
feet will be capsized 20% of the time. Ships not capsized will sustain 
some damage 

In combat, when neither its bite nor its capsizing attack is enough 
to defeat an enemy, a dragon turtle will use its breath weapon. The 
turtle can belch forth a cloud of scalding steam that will cover an area 
60 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 40 feet high, This attack causes 20420 
points of damage (20d6J, and characters or creatures making a saving 
throw vs, breath weapon take half damage. Like true dragons, drag’ 
on turtles can use this deadly breath weapon three times a day. 



Habilat/Soriety: Dragon turtles are extremely solitary creatures. 
Large, desolate sea caves and secret underground caverns that can be 
accessed only through the water are their favorite lairs, These lairs 
are difficult to find, but adventurers locating a dragon turtles cave 
will find it filled with treasures of all types. The turtle gathers this 
treasure, which it will protect to the death, from the ships sunk in its 
territory 

A dragon turtle's territory is well-defined and may cover as much 
as fifty square miles of open water. Other dragon turtles are allowed 
into this area only during mating season, though turtles of the same 
sex will always fight to the death upon meeting. It is this hostility 
toward their own kind that keeps the number of dragon turtles rela¬ 
tively low. 

Mariners of any experience recognize the terri torial claims of drag¬ 
on turtles and will often make extravagant tributes to the turtle con¬ 
trolling areas necessary for safe and speedy trade. 


Ecology: Dragon turtles are carnivorous and will eat almost any 
creature, including humans or other dragon turtles, to satisfy their 
voracious appetite* Large fish seem to be the prefered food for drag¬ 
on turtles, and the turtles can often be found lurking in the weeds and 
muck at the bottom of a lake or sea waiting for fish to pass. In partic¬ 
ularly poor years for fish, dragon turtles have been known to use 
their breath weapon to kill large groups of sea birds that stray too 
dose to the water for food 

Conflict often arises between dragon turtles and the many intelli¬ 
gent aquatic races, like the locathah or mermen, because of competi¬ 
tion for ideal bits. Like many of their land-based relatives, dragon 
turtles are considered treacherous and selfish by all creatures that 
share their domain. 

Dragon turtle shells make outstanding shields and armor. Because 
of the shells strength and natural resistance to the dragon turtle's 
own breath weapon, armor or a shield made out of this material 
gains +1 to its defensive rating. The shield or armor will also save as 
an item against destruction by fire or steam-based attacks at +4.

A chaotic offshoot of the pseudodragon, the faerie dragon lives 
in peaceful, tangled forests and thrives on pranks, mischief, and 
practical jokes. 

Faerie dragons resemble miniature dragons with thin bodies, 
long, prehensile tails, gossamer butterfly wings, and huge smiles. 
Their colors range through the spectrum, changing as they age, 
from the red of a hatchling to the black of a great wyrm tsee 
chart). The hides of females have a golden tinge that sparkles in 
the sunlight: males have a silver tinge. 

All faerie dragons can communicate telepathically with one 
another at a distance of up to 2 miles. They speak their own lan¬ 
guage, along with the language of sprites, pixies, elves, and the 
birds and animals in their area, 


Combat: Faerie dragons can become invisible at will, and can at¬ 
tack. use spells, and employ breath weapons while invisible. 
They attack as 4-HD monsters, biting for 1-2 points of damage, 
Most (65 %) faerie dragons employ wizard spells as a wizard of 
the level indicated on the accompanying chart: 35% employ 
priest spells of the following spheres: Animal, Plant, Elemental, 
and Weather. Almost ail spells are chosen for mischief potential. 
The two most common spells of faerie dragons are water breath¬ 
ing and legend lore , other favorites include ventriloquism, un¬ 
seen servant, forget , suggestion, distance distortion, limited 
wish, obscuremmt, animal growth, and animate rock. 

A faerie dragon usually begins its attacks by turning invisible 
and using its breath weapon, a 2-foot-diameter cloud of euphoria 
gas. A victim failing a saving throw vs, breath weapon will wan¬ 
der around aimlessly in a state of bliss for the next 3d4 minutes, 
during which time he is unable to attack and his Armor Class is 
decreased by 2, Even though he is unable to attack, the victim 
can keep his mind on the situation if he succeeds on an Intelli¬ 
gence check (by roiling his Intelligence score or less on ld20) each 
round: if he fails an Intelligence check, he completely loses inter¬ 
est in the matters at hand for the duration of the breath weapon's 
effect. 

Faerie dragons avoid combat and never intentionally inflict 
damage unless cornered or defending their lairs. If attacked, 
however, they engage in spirited defense, ably supported by 
sprite and pixie friends, until the opponents are driven away. 



Habitat Society: Faerie dragons make their lairs in the hollow's of 
high trees, preferably near a pond or stream, because they are 
quite fond of swimming and diving. They often live in the com¬ 
pany of a group of pixies or sprites. 

Faerie dragons take advantage of every opportunity to wreak 
mischief on passers-by, frequently using forest creatures to help 
them in their pranks. Though many of these pranks are sponta¬ 
neous, months of preparation can go into a single, spectacular 
practical joke. A tell-tale giggle, which sounds like the tinkling of 
tiny silver bells, often alerts potential victims to the presence of 
invisible faerie dragons. 

Ecology: Faerie dragons eat fruit, vegetables, nuts, roots, honey, 
and grains. They are especially fond of fruit pastries and have 
been known to go to great lengths to get a fresh apple pie.

Although frequently mistaken on first sighting for a young red 
dragon, the firedrake is neither as intelligent nor as powerful as 
its dragon cousin. It responds with flame to any stimulus. 

This small dragonet—4 r long, and a bit over 2‘ tn height—has 
the features and proportions of a miniature red dragon, but its 
scaly hide is thinner and more translucent than that of even the 
youngest of true dragons. The hide of the dragonet twitches and 
quivers almost imperceptibly, and is somewhat mottled in color, 
with mauve and burgundy splotches over the red undercolor. 
The wings beat slowly even when the dragonet is on the ground. 
In this manner the firedrake provides air flow to itself, and wards 
off pesky insects. A shimmer of heat rises off of the dragonet at 
all times. 


Combat: If a firedrake is disturbed, there is a 50% chance it will 
attack. Its primary* attack is its breath weapon (fire), which It can 
use up to five times daily The fire forms a cone from the snout of 
the dragonet to a 10' diameter circle at the extreme end of its 60' 
range, and causes 2-16 points on all affected (save vs. breath weap¬ 
on for half damage). The firedrake's claws are not used in combat, 
but its bite will cause 2-8 points of damage. 

The dragonet s blood burns fiercely in air, as there is a high 
phosphorous content to the blood. In fact, the fire-breathing of 
these creatures ts actually the voluntary expelling of a jet of its 
pyrophoric blood. Because of the flammability of the dragon's 
blood, blunt weapons such as staves or clubs are less dangerous 
than those which cause blood loss. Any creature making a suc¬ 
cessful slashing or piercing attack on a firedrake must save vs. 
breath weapon, or take 1-2 points of fire damage. 

In aerial combaL, the firedrake is particularly fond of attacking 
airborne creatures from below and behind. The heat from the 
firedrake and its breath attack naturally radiates upwards, some¬ 
times disrupting the maneuvers of creatures that depend on rela¬ 
tively smooth air currents for flying or gliding. The firedrake will 
sometimes simply ram smaller opponents in their soft underbelly 
in the hope of stunning them and causing them to plummet to 
their deaths. 

Habitat Society: Firedrakes are familial creatures, with a mated 
male and female taking up residence in a lair, which is generally a 
small cavelet or rocky shelf under a ledge or outcropping, Usu¬ 
ally six to eight eggs are laid and tended by the pair, being kept 
warm by the ample heat of the bodies of the parents. The eggs, 



laid in early summer, take about 60 days to hatch. The young 
firedrakes learn to breathe fire even before they learn to fly, and 
are even more nervous than the adults, spouting flames several 
times a day in the lair or nearby during this period, Flight first 
occurs about 60 days after hatching. 

The parents are very protective of their lair because of the 
young. Although firedrakes normally only range 1-2 miles from 
their tain they may patrol up to twice that distance during the 
times at which their young are most vulnerable to attack. 

Firedrakes leave the family lair early in the spring following 
their hatching, flying sometimes scores of miles before encoun¬ 
tering a firedrake of the opposite sex willing to mate for life and 
establish a new lair The rare mating fights that do occur are spec¬ 
tacularly fiery, although one male usually concedes and retreats 
before the battle becomes lethal. 

Firedrakes gather no treasure, although they take no special 
care to remove the bones or effects of arty that they defeat. 

Ecology: Firedrakes have a short lifespan compared with their 
larger cousins, the dragons, usually living only 75 to 100 years. 

Firedrake blood can be kept, in its liquid state, in a sealed and 
airtight container, or under water or some other inert liquid. It 
can then be used as a firebomb, equivalent to a torched flask of 
oil, or used to create flaming weapons. For instance, swards 
dipped in the blood immediately become flaming swords for 3-6 
melee rounds, although the sudden, intense heat upon the blade 
creates a 2% cumulative chance per round of the sword breaking 
upon impact with each blow struck during the period in which 
flame engulfs it. After the flame ends, the sword is otherwise un¬ 
affected. 

The blood of the firedrake actually bums within its veins, cre¬ 
ating the shimmer of heat that always rises from these creatures. 
The burning of the blood also requires a high level of oxygen, 
hence the constant slow beating of the dragonet's wings, even at 
rest. If deprived of air, it will die of suffocation in about half the 
time of a similarly sized creature.

Pseudodragons are a species of small flying lizard that inhabits 
heavily forested wilderness areas. These playful, benign crea¬ 
tures have magical powers that they can share with others, so 
they are often sought as companions. 

Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons. They have 
fine scales and sharp horns and teeth, A pseudodragans colora¬ 
tion is red-brown as opposed to the deep red of red dragons. Its 
tail is about 2 feet long (longer than the pseudodragon itself), 
barbed, and very flexible. 

Pseudodragons communicate via a limited form of telepathy. If 
one elects to take a human companion, it can transmit what it 
sees and hears at a distance of up to 240 yards. Pseudodragons 
can vocalize animal noises such as a rasping purr (pleasure), a 
hiss (unpleasant surprise!, a chirp (desire), or a growl (anger). 

Combat: The pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite with Us 
small, dragonlike jaws, but its major weapon is its sting- 
equipped tail. The creature can move it with flashing speed and 
strikes at +4 on attack rolls. Any creature struck must save vs. 
poison or go into a state of catalepsy that lasts 1-6 days. The vie* 
tim appears quite dead, but at the end of that time the character 
will either wake up unharmed (75% chance) or die (25 % chance). 

Pseudodragons have a chameleon like power that allows them 
to alter their coloration to blend with their surroundings. They 
can blend into any typical forest background with an 80% 
chance of being undetected by creatures which cannot see invisi¬ 
ble objects. Pseudodragons have infra vision with a 60 foot range 
and can see invisible objects, 

A pseudodragon is highly map resistant and can transmit this 
magic resistance to its human companion via physical contact (a 
pseudodragon likes to be perched on the top of ones head or 
curled around the shoulders and upper back). 

Habitat Society: These forest-dwelling creatures place their 
lairs in the hollows of great trees or in large caves. 

A pseudodragon will very rarely take a human or demihuman 
as its companion. Some view these pseudodragons as the hu- 
man s pet; the pseudodragon will be sure to correct this misun¬ 
derstanding. There are two ways to become a pseudodragons 
companion; one is to use magic to summon it (a find familiar 



spell). Another way is to find the pseudodragon on an adventure 
and pursuade it to become a companion. The pseudodragon that 
searches for companionship will stalk a candidate silently for 
days, reading his thoughts via telepathy judging his deeds to be 
good or evil. If the candidate is found to be good, the pseudodra¬ 
gon will present itself to the human as a traveling companion and 
observe the human 5 reaction. If the human seems overjoyed and 
promises to take very good care of it, the pseudodragon will ac¬ 
cept. If not, it will fly away. 

The persona lity of a pseudodragon has been described by some 
as catlike. A pseudodragon is willing to serve, provided that it is 
well-fed. groomed, and receives lots of attention. At times a 
pseudodragon seems arrogant, demanding, and less than willing 
to help. In order to gain its full cooperation, the companion must 
pamper the pseudodragon and make it feel as though it were the 
most important thing in his life. If the pseudodragon is mistreat¬ 
ed or insulted it will leave, or worse, play pranks when least ex* 
pected. Pseudodragons particularly dislike cruelty and will not 
serve cruel masters. 

Ecology: Pseudodragons are omnivorous but prefer to eat 
meat. Their diet consists chiefly of rodents and small birds with 
occasional leaves, fruits, and berries, In the wild, pseudodragons 
live solitary lives, protecting small personal hoards in their nests. 
They gather to mate once per year, in early spring, when gather¬ 
ings of dozens of pseudodragons are not uncommon. After mat¬ 
ing, males and females separate; females lay speckled brown eggs 
in clutches of four to six which hatch in mid-summer: females 
raise the young by themselves. Pseudodragons hibernate in 
winter; the young leave the nest in spring to mate. 

Pseudodragons have a lifespan of 10*15 years. Like dragons, 
they are attracted to bright shiny objects. Pseudodragon eggs can 
be resold for up to 10,000 gold pieces while a hatchling is worth 
as much as 20,000 gold pieces.

Possessing some oi the most dangerous qualities of a lion and a 
brass dragon, the dragonne is a vicious and deadly hunter, and a 
threat to many who travel in warmer climates. 

From a distance, a dragonne looks much like a giant lion, with 
the one very notable exception of the pair of small, brass-colored 
wings that stretch from the creatures shoulders. Upon closer in¬ 
spection, other differences between the dragonne and its feline 
ancestor become apparent, too. The dragonne is covered with 
thick, brass-colored scales, much like a brass dragon, and its 
mane is much thicker and made of far coarser hair than a lion's, 
The beast also possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, 
usually brass-colored like its scales. Dragonnes do not have their 
own language. Instead, they speak the languages of brass drag¬ 
ons and sphinxes. 


Combat: Dragonnes usually attack first with their front daws, in¬ 
flicting Idfi points of damage with each set, and their terrible jaws, 
inflicting 3d6 points of damage. This is usually enough to slay most 
of the creatures the dragonne encounters. If a dragonne is in combat 
with an especially deadly opponent, or is wounded in a battle with a 
lesser opponent, however, it will use its deadly roar. 

A dragonne s roar causes weakness (due to fear) in all creatures 
within 120 feet of the monster* unless they roll successful saving 
throws vs. paralyzation. Those creatures that save are not affect¬ 
ed, but those that fad to save lose 50% of their Strength for 2d6 
rounds. Worse still, any creature within 30 feet of the dragonne 
when it roars are deafened for 2d6 rounds* No save is possible 
against the deafening aspect of the dragonne s roar, and all affect¬ 
ed creatures cannot hear any sound and fight with a -1 penalty to 
attack rolls (due to disorientation), 

The dragonrte's roar is like a dragon s breath weapon in that it 
can only be used three times a day. Creatures within the range of 
the dragonnes roar must roll saving throws vs, fear each time 
they hear it. Once a creature is deafened, however, it cannot hear 
the dragonnes roar, and need not save against it, until the 2db 
rounds of temporary deafness are over. 

Although a dragonne's wings are useful only for short periods 
of time, carrying the creature for only 1-3 turns at a time, the 
dragonne uses its wings very effectively in battle. If any creatures 
attempt to charge the dragonne or encircle it, the dragonne sim¬ 
ply takes to the air and finds a more defensible position, The dra~ 
gonne prefers not to fight in the air, as it is very slow and 



maneuvers poorly compared to most flying creatures. It can fight 
with its claws and bite, and even its roar, when airborne, so it 
remains almost as deadly in the air as on the ground, 

Habitat/Society: Dragonnes prefer to dwell in rocky foothills 
and deserts. They lake large, natural caves for their lairs and 
store their small amounts of treasure, usually taken from slain 
adventurers, in loose piles around their rocky homes* Their terri¬ 
tories are usually very large, as they generally inhabit desolate 
areas. 

They cannot bear the company of other dragonnes, and the 
creatures are found in pairs only during their brief mating sea¬ 
son, late in the autumn, Dragonnes lay eggs, like their reptilian 
ancestors, and only one egg is produced a year by any dragonne. 
The female raises this young dragonne for one year, after which 
time even a mother and her young will be unfriendly if they meet. 
Male dragonnes are always antagonistic toward each other. 

In fact, dragonnes get along wiLh very few T creatures, and are 
considered a menace by most sentient races. More than anything, 
however, dragonnes wish to be left alone to hunt. 

Ecology: The dragonne prefers herd animals like goats for 
food, especially since they don't fight back as fiercely as humans. 
It only attacks a human or demihuman for food if no other game 
is available. 

Dragonnes are not necessarily aggressive toward strangers, and 
the creature's reputation as a mindless devourer of helpless travelers 
is more the product of ignorance than well-researched fact. A dra¬ 
gonne will almost always attack any creature that invades its lair or 
threatens its territory. This means that adventurers w f ho stumble 
across a dragonnes cave or settlers who decide to build in a dra- 
gormes territory are often subject to fierce and immediate attack. 
Creatures not threatening the dragonnes lair or simply passing 
through its territory are usually left alone. Though the dragonnes 
intelligence is low. It can tell the difference between a harmless trav¬ 
eler and a potentially troublesome settler.

Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites. They are as elusive 
as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless 
taken by surprise—or they wish to be spotted. 

The dryad s exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are 
much like an elf maiden's. Dryads have high cheek bones and 
amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad's complexion and hair 
color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural 
camouflage. During the fall a dryad's hair turns golden or red. 
and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more 
closely match her hair color. This enables her to blend with the 
falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad's hair and skin 
are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When en¬ 
countered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mis¬ 
taken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one 
would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and sum¬ 
mer, however. At these times of year, a dryad's skin is lightly 
tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her. 

Dryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The 
clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they 
appear. They speak their own tongue, as well as the languages of 
elves, pixies, and sprites. Dryads can also speak with plants. 

Combat: Dryads are shy, nonviolent creatures. They rarely 
carry weapons, but they sometimes carry knives as tools. 
Though a dryad can use this as a weapon in a fight, she will not 
resort to using a knife unless seriously threatened. 

Dryads have the ability to throw a powerful charm person 
spell three times a day (but only once per round). This spell is so 
powerful that targets of the spell suffer a -3 penalty to their sav¬ 
ing throws. A Dryad always uses this spell if seriously threat¬ 
ened, attempting to gain control of the attacker who could help 
her most against his comrades. Dryads will only attempt to 
charm elves as a last resort because of their natural resistance to 
this type of spell. 

The dryad's use of her ability to charm is not limited to combat 
situations, however. Whenever a dryad encounters a male with a 
Charisma of 16 or more, she usually tries to charm him. Charis¬ 
matic victims of a dryad's attentions are taken to the tree sprite's 
home, where the men serve as amorous slaves to their beautiful 
captors. There is a 50% chance that a person charmed and taken 
away by a dryad will never return. If he does escape from the 
dryads charms, it will be after ld4 years of captivity. 

This tree sprite also has two other powers that are very useful 



in defense. Unless surprised, a dryad has the ability to literally 
step through a tree and then dimension door to the oak tree she is 
part of . She can also speak with plants (as the 4lh-level priest 
spell), This enables the dryad to gather information about parties 
traveling near her tree, and even to use vegetation to hinder po¬ 
tential attackers, 

HabitahSoriety; Some legends claim that dryads are the ani¬ 
mated souls of very old oak trees. Whether this is really the case, 
it is true that dryads are attached to a single, very large oak tree 
in their lifetimes and cannot, for any reason, go more than 360 
yards from that tree. If a dryad does wander farther away, she 
becomes weak and dies within 6d6 hours unless returned to her 
home. The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but some¬ 
one finding a dryad's home has great power over her, A dryad 
suffers damage for any damage inflicted upon her home tree. 
Any attack on a dryad's tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied 
defense by the dryad. 

Although dryads are generally very solitary, up to six have 
been encountered in one place. This is rare, however. All this re¬ 
ally means is that a number of dryad oaks are within 100 yards of 
one another and the dryads' paths cross. These dryads may come 
to each other's aid, but never really gather socially. .Any treasure 
owned by a tree sprite is hidden dose to her home tree. The gold 
and gems that make up a dryads treasure are almost always the 
gifts of charmed adventurers. 

These tree sprites realize that most humans and demihumans 
fear them for their ability to charm, so dryads only deal with 
strangers on rare occasions. When approadied carefully, how¬ 
ever, dryads have been known to aid adventurers. They are a 
useful source of information, too, as they know a great deal 
about the area in which they live. 

Ecology: Dryads are staunch protectors of the forest and 
groves in which they reside. Any actions that harm the area, and 
especially its plant life, are met with little tolerance.

Dwarves are a noble race of demihumans who dwell under the 
earth, forging great cities and waging massive wars against the 
forces of chaos and evil. Dwarves also have much in common 
with the rocks and gems they love to work, for they are both 
hard and unyielding* It s often been said that it's easier to make a 
stone weep than it is to change a dwarf's mind. 

Standing from four to 4Vz feet in height, and weighing 130 to 
170 pounds, dwarves tend to be stocky and muscular. They have 
ruddy cheeks and bright eyes* Their skin is typically deep tan or 
light brown* Their hair is usually black, gray, or brown, and 
worn long, though not long enough to impair vision in any way* 
They iavor long beards and mustaches, too* Dwarves value their 
beards highly and tend to groom them very carefully. Dwarves 
do not favor ornate stylings or wrappings for their hair or their 
beards. 

Dwarven clothing tends to be simple and functional* They of¬ 
ten wear earth tones, and their cloth is considered rough by 
many other races, especially men and elves. Dwarves usually 
wear one or more pieces of jewelry, though these items are usu¬ 
ally not of any great value or very ostentatious* Though dwarves 
value gems and precious metals, they consider It in bad taste to 
flaunt wealth* 

Because dwarves are a sturdy race, they add 1 to their initial 
Constitution ability scores. However, because they are a solitary' 
people, tending toward distrust of outsiders and other races, they 
subtract 1 from their initial Charisma ability scores* Dwarves 
usually live from 350 to 450 years. 

Dwarves have found it useful to learn the languages of many 
of their allies and enemies. In addition to their own languages, 
dwarves often speak the languages of gnomes, goblins, kobolds. 
ores, and the common tongue, which is frequently used in trade 
negotiations with other races. 

Combat: Dwarves are courageous, tenacious fighters who are 
ill-disposed toward magic. They never use magical spells or train 
as wizards, though they can become priests and use the spells of 
this group Because of their nonmagical nature, in fact they get a 
special bonus to all saving throws against magical wands, staves, 
rods, and spells* Dwarves receive a +1 bonus to saving throws 



against these magical attacks for every Vfa points of Constitu¬ 
tion score they have. See Table 9 on page 21 of the Player's Hand¬ 
book for specific bonuses. 

A dwarf's nonmagical nature can also cause problems when he 
tries to use a magical item. In fact, if a dwarf uses a magical item 
that it not specifically created for his class, there is a 20% chance 
the item malfunctions* For example, if a dwarven fighter uses a 
bag of holding —which can be used by any class, not just 
fighters—there is a 20% chance each time the dwarf uses it that 
the bag does not work properly* This chance of malfunction ap¬ 
plies to rods, slaves, wands, rings, amulets, potions, horns, 
jewels, and miscellaneous magic. However, dwarves have 
learned to master certain types of magical items—because of an 
items military nature* These objects—specifically weapons, 
shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles—are not subject to magical 
malfunction when used by a dwarf of any class, 

As with magical attacks, dwarves are unusually resistant to 
toxic substances. Because of their exceptionally strong Constitu¬ 
tion, all dwarves roll saving throws against poisons with the 
same bonus (+1 for every 3Vz points of Constitution score) that 
applies to saves vs. magical attacks. 

In the thousands of years that dwarves have lived in the earth, 
they have developed a number of skills and special abilities that 
help them to survive. All dwarves have infravision that enables 
them to see up to 60 feet in the dark. When underground, 
dwarves can tell quite a bit about their location by looking care¬ 
fully at their surroundings. When within 10 feet of what they are 
looking for, dwarves can detect the grade and slope of a passage 
&lt;1-5 on ld6), new tunnel construction (1-5 on ld6), sliding/ 
shifting walls or rooms (1-4 on ld6). and stonework traps, pits, 
and deadfalls (1-3 on ld6J. Dwarves can also determine their ap¬ 
proximate depth underground (1-3 on ld6) at any time. 

During their time under the earth, dwarves have also devel¬ 
oped an intense hatred ot many of the evil creatures they com¬ 
monly encounter. Thus, in melee, dwarves always add 1 to their 
attack rolls to hit ores, half-ores, goblins, and hobgoblins. The

Dwarf 


small size of dwarves is an advantage against ogres, trolls, ogre 
magi, giants, and titans; these monsters always subtract 4 From 
their attack rolls against dwarves because of that size difference 
and the dwarves' training in fighting such large foes. 

Dwarven armies are well-organized and extremely well- 
disciplined. Dwarven troops usually wear chain mail and carry 
shields in battle. They wield a variety of weapons. The composi¬ 
tion of a typical dwarven army by weaponry is axe and hammer 
(25%) sword and spear (20% ) T sword and Iighl crossbow' {15%), 
sword and pole arm (10% ), axe and heavy crossbow (10%), axe 
and mace (10%), or hammer and pick (10%). 

For every 40 dwarves encountered, there is a 2nd- to othdevel 
fighter who leads the group, (Roll ld6 to determine level, with a 
roll of 1 equalling 2.) If there are 160 or more dwarves encoun¬ 
tered, there are, in addition to the leaders of the smaller groups, 
one 6th-level fighter (a chief) and a 4th-level fighter (lieutenant) 
commanding the troops. If 200 or more dwarves are encoun¬ 
tered. there is a fighter.‘priest of 3rd- to Dth-level fighting ability 
and 4th-to 7th4evel priest ability, tf a dwarven army has 320 or 
more troops in it, the following high-level leaders are in com¬ 
mand of the group: an Stb-level fighter, a 7th-levei fighter, a 6th- 
leve] Bghter/7th-level priest, and two 4th-leve! fighter/priests. 

The commanders of the dwarven troops wear plate armor and 
carry shields. In addition, the fighters and fighter/priests leading 
the dwarven troops have a 10% chance per level of fighting abili¬ 
ty of having magical armor and 'or weapons. The fighter/priests 
who lead the troops also have a 10% chance per level of priest 
ability of having a magical item specific to priests {and thus not 
subject to malfunction). 

If encountered in its home, a dwarven army has, in addition to 
the leaders noted above. 2d6 fighters of from 2nd- to Sth-level 
(ld4 + l for level), 2d4 fighter priests of from 2nd- to 4th-level 
(in each classl females equal to 50% of the adult males, and chil¬ 
dren equal to 25% of the adult males. Dwarven women are 
skilled in combat and fight as males if their homes are attacked. 

Habitat Society: Usually constructed around profitable mines, 
dwarven cities are vast, beautiful complexes carved into solid 
stone. Dwarven cities take hundreds of years to complete, but 
once finished they stand for millennia without needing any type 
of repair. Since dwarves do not leave their homes often and al¬ 
ways return to them, they create their cities with permanence in 
mind. Troops guard dwarven cities at all times, and sometimes 
(60% chance) dwarves also use animals as guards—either 2d4 
brown bears (75% chance) or 5d4 wolves (25% chance). 

Dwarven society is organized into dans. A dwarven dan not 
already attached to a city or mine travels until it finds an outpost 
where it can begin to ply a trade. Clans often settle close together 
since they usually need the same raw materials for their crafts. 
Clans are competitive, but usually do not war against one an¬ 
other. Dwarven cities are founded when enough clans move to a 
particular location. 

Each dwarven clan usually specializes in a particular craft or 
skill; young dwarves are apprenticed at an early age to a master in 
their dan (or, occasionally in another clan) to learn a trade. Since 
dwarves live so long, apprenticeships last for many years. 
Dwarves also consider political and military service a skilled trade, 
so soldiers and politicians are usually subjected to a long period of 
apprenticeship before they arc considered professionals. 

To folk from other races, life within these cities might seem as 
rigid and unchanging as the stone that the dwarven houses are 
wrought from. In fact, it is. Above all. dwarves value law and 
order. This love of stability probably comes from the dwarves 4 
long life spans, for dwarves can watch things made of wood and 


other mutable materials decay within a single lifetime. It 
shouldn't be surprising, then, that they value things that are un¬ 
changing and toil ceaselessly to make their crafts beautiful and 
long-lived. For a dwarf, the earth is something to be loved be¬ 
cause of its stability and the sea a thing to be despised—and 
feared—because it is a symbol of change. 

Dwarves also prize wealth, as it is something that can be devel¬ 
oped over a long period of time. All types ol precious metal, but 
particularly gold, are highly prized by dwarves, as are diamonds 
and other gems. They do not value pearls, however, as they are 
reminders of the sea and all it stands for. Dwarves believe, how¬ 
ever, that it is in poor taste to advertise wealth. Metals and gems 
are best counted in secret, so that neighbors are not offended or 
tempted. 

Most other races see dwarves as a greedy, dour, grumpy folk 
who prefer the dampness of a cave to the brightness of an open 
glade. This is partially true. Dwarves have little patience for men 
and other short-lived races (since man's concerns seem so petty 
when seen from dwarven eyes). Dwarves also mistrust elves be¬ 
cause they are not as serious-minded as dwarves and waste their 
long lives on pastimes the dwarves see as frivolous. However, 
dwarves have been known to band together with both men and 
elves in times of crisis, and long-term trade agreements and alli¬ 
ances are common. 

Dwarves have no mixed feelings about the evil races that dwell 
below ground and in the Underdark, however. They have an in¬ 
tense hatred of ores, goblins, evil giants, and drow. The dire 
creatures of the Underdark often fear dwarves, too, for the short, 
stout folk are tireless enemies of evil and chaos* It is a goal of the 
dwarves to wage constant and bitter war against their enemies 
under the earth until either they or their foes are destroyed. 

Ecology: Since much of their culture is tocused on creating 
things from the earth, dwarves produce a large amount of useful, 
valuable trade material. Dwarves are skilled miners. Though 
they rarely sell the precious metals and rough gems they uncover, 
dwarven miners have been known to sell surpluses to local hu¬ 
man communities. Dwarves are also skilled engineers and master 
builders—though they work almost exclusively with stone—and 
some dwarven architects work for humans quite frequently. 

Dwarves most often trade in finished goods* Many dans are 
dedicated to work as blacksmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, ar¬ 
morers, weapons makers, and gem cutters. Dwarven products 
are highly valued for their workmanship. In human communi¬ 
ties, these goods often demand prices up to 20% higher than lo¬ 
cally forged items. Many people are still whiling to pay a high 
price for a suit of dwarven mail or a dwarven sword. Humans 
know* that the dwarf who forget! the item made it to last a dwar¬ 
ven lifetime, so they'll never need to worry about it wearing out 
in theirs. 

Mountain Dwarves 

Similar in most ways to their cousins, the hill dwarves, these 
demihumans prefer to live deep inside mountains. They tend to 
be slightly taller than hill dwarves (averaging 4 J /2 feet tall) and 
more hearty (having 1 + 1 Hit Dice). They usually have slightly 
lighter skin and hair than their hill-dwelling relatives. In battle, 
mountain dwarf armies are likely to have more spears (30% max¬ 
imum) and fewer crossbows (20% maximum) than hill dwarf 
armies. Mountain dwarves have the same interests and biases as 
hill dwarves, though they are even more isolationist than their 
cousins and sometimes consider even hili dwarves to be outsid¬ 
ers. Mountain dwarves live for at least 400 years.

Derro are a degenerate race of dwarven stature. They have been 
skulking in the Underdark for ages, but they were discovered by 
the mind flayers only five centuries ago, and by the drow but 
shortly before that. The derro have made a name for themselves 
by their marked cruelty It is said that a derro lives for just two 
things: to witness the slow, humiliating death of surface demi- 
humans, and especially humans; and the perversion of knowl¬ 
edge to their own dark ends. 

Derro are short, with skin the color of an iced over lake (white, 
with bluish undertones), sickly pale yellow or tan hair (always 
straight), and staring eyes that have no pupils. Their features re¬ 
mind dwarves of humans, and vice versa. Derro have rough 
skin, spotted with short coarse tufts of hair. Most derro wear a 
loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and 
dyed deep red or brown. Their armor is leather, studded in cop¬ 
per and brass Leaders wear tougher, kather armors, made from 
the hides of beasts far more rugged than cattle. 

Combat: Derro are one of the most dexterous of humanoid races 
(averaging 2548), and their Armor Class must be adjusted for 
this. Normally a derro party ls well-equipped with weapons and 
spells. All derro carry small, ornamental blades, called secari 
which can be treated as daggers, but most use other weapons as 
well. 

Half of all encountered derro carry a repeating light crossbow 
(.12 maximum range, two shots each round, six-bolt capacity ld3 
points of damage). Derro crossbowman usually coat their bolts 
with poison. If a derro wants to simply bring down his prey he 
uses a poison that causes an additional 2d6 points of damage 
(successful saving throw for no additional damage). If he desires 
to prolong his targets suffering, he uses a poison that has the 
same effects as a ray of enfeeblement spell (asuceessful saving 
throw indicates no poison damage). 



Twentydive percent of derro carry a hook-fauchard. a long 
(6' + ) pole arm that causes ld4 points of impaling damage and 
can pull a man-sized or smaller creature off-balance 25% of the 
time. It takes one round to regain balance. 

Fifteen percent of derro use only a spiked buckler. This small 
shield, improves the derro s AC by 1 against any one opponent. 
It is armed with a central spike, which can be wielded as a second 
weapon (no penalty because of the derm's high Dexterity) for ld4 
points of impaling damage. The derro will also have a hooked 
aklys, a short, heavy dub that can be thrown for ld6 points of 
crushing damage. It is attached to a thick leather thong so that it 
can be retrieved. Thanks to the hook, the aklys also pulls an op¬ 
ponent off-balance but it has only a 1-8 chance. These derro are 
considered brave by their fellows; they are awarded the rarer 
heavier armors (AC 4), 

The remaining 10% of the derro are the sons and daughters of 
derro leaders. They are given heavier armor and trained in the 
use of the spear and the military pick. They use bucklers (sans 
spikes) when not using the spear with both hands. 

For every three derro encountered, there is one with 4 Hit 
Dice, For every six derro, there is one with 5 Hit Dice, If 10 or 
more, there is a 7 Hit Die leader with a 6 Hit Die lieutenant. If a 
party encounters 25 derro, they would be accompanied by eight 
4 Hit Die derm, four of 5 Hit Die, one with 6 Hit Dice, and one 
with 7. The leaders always wear the thicker armor and usually 
wield well-made {and occasionally magical) weapons. 

If 20 or more are encountered, they are accompanied by a sa¬ 
vant and two students. Savant derro are able to use any sort of 
magical item or weapon. Savants know ld4 + 5 of the following 
spells, learned at random: affect normal fires, anti-magic shell, 
blink , cloudkill BSP hypnotic pattern, ice storm, invisibility, 
levitate, light, lightning boh, minor creation l paralyzation, re¬ 
pulsion. shadow magic, spider climb, ventriloquism , wall of fog, 
wall of force. Savants have 5-8 Hit Dice, and carry two or three 
useful magical items. Typical magical items are any potion, any 
scroll, rings of fire resistance , invisibility, protection , and spell 


96 






Dwarf 


storing , any wand, studded leather armor + 1, shields, weapons 
up to +3, bracers of defense brooches of shielding &gt; cloaks of 
protection, and so on. Savants can instinctively comprehend lan¬ 
guages and read magic (as the spells). 

Savants are capable of acting as sages in one to three areas of 
study. Derro raids are often inspired by a savant's research. 

Student savants know only 1-3 spells, have 4-7 Hit Dice, they 
know only one field of study, and one minor magical item. 

In combat, derro fight cunningiy, with good tactics. They keep 
speikasters from effectively using magic, and inflict minor 
wounds until they eventually kill their opponents. Savants use 
their powers to confuse and frustrate, rather than to simply kill. 
Derro have poor infravision (3-foot range) but keen hearing 
(treat as the blind-fighting, non weapon proficiency). 

Derro keep slaves and attempt to capture intelligent oppo¬ 
nents, when possible. 

Habitat Society: Derro live in large underground complexes, 
nearer the surface than the kuo-toans and drow, but deeper than 
goblins and trolls. They never expose themselves to direct sun¬ 
light; it nauseates them. Sunlight will kill a derro if he is exposed 
to it for several days. Still, derro do visit the surface at night, 
raiding for humans or carrying out a savant's plans, 

Derro are never encountered singly. From their combat tactics 
to their choice of spells, derro demonstrate a mob mentality, A 
lone derro is a desperate derro, seeking at all costs to return to his 
home. 

Derro lairs always have 3d4 +30 norma) derro, plus leaders. 
The members of the lair are led by the resident savants (1-3 in 
number) and their apprentices (2-5 students!. Derro obey with¬ 
out question the puzzling, even suicidal, dictates from their sa¬ 
vant leaders. 

Also to be found in a derro lair are 5d6 + 10 human slaves. If 
any of the lair s savants or students know the charm person spell, 
each slave has a 90% chance of being charmed. Derro hate hu¬ 
mans more than any other race; they use humans for the most 
demeaning manual labor, and for breeding, 

Derro do not appear to worship any powers, but the savants 
treasure knowledge and the rest seem to worship the savants. 

Derro usually scour their territory for magical items, stealing 
them, or. If necessary, purchasing them from more powerful 
creatures. Derro do not share the love of gold common to their 
dwarven relatives, and they have been known to pay exorbitant 
prices for a few potions or for a magical item with a missing com¬ 
mand word. 

Every 20 years or so. the derro mount an all-out war against 
the other creatures of the Underdark, This is known as the Unit¬ 
ing War, and no savant really expects it to be won. The War is a 
means of winnowing out the weakest of the derro lairs, a focal 
point for racial identity, and a chance to really create some terror 
in the Underdark. It also serves the purpose of starting rumors. 
Humans will certainly hear that a war is being fought in the 
Underdark, and they will send hundreds of scouting and adven¬ 
turing parties to the underground to investigate. The derro wel¬ 
come this new source of slaves. 

Ecology: Derro can live on a die! of underground fungi, but use It 
only for spice. They seek out other sustenance whenever possi¬ 
ble. A derro hunting party usually pursues large, dangerous prey 
that will feed an entire lair, rather than smaller, simpler food. The 
derro tendency to torment prey also holds when for hunting 
food. They also raid other races tor food. 


Duergar 

Duergar, or gray dwarves, are a malevolent breed that exist at 
extreme depths underground, Duergar may be fighters, priests, 
thieves, or multi-classed fighter/priests, fighter, thieves, or 
priest/thieves. Thieves are proficient in the use of poison. 

Duergar appear to be emaciated, nasty-looking dwarves. 
Their complexions and hair range from medium to dark gray. 
They prefer drab clothing designed to blend into their environ¬ 
ment. In their lairs, they may wear jewelry, although such pieces 
are kept dull. 

Duergar have infravision to 120 feet. They speak the duergar 
dialect of the dwarven tongue, "undercommon f ' (the trading lan¬ 
guage of subterranean cultures), and the silent speech employed 
by some subterranean creatures. Intelligent duergar may speak 
other languages as well. 

Combat: For every four, single HD duergar encountered outside 
a lair, there is one with 2 HD + 4 hp. If a band of nine are encoun¬ 
tered outside a lair, there will be a tenth, with 3 HD + 6 hp or 4 
HD +6 hp always leads the group. 

Duergar are armed as follows: 

1st level; pick, hammer, spear, chain mail, and shield; 

2nd level; pick, light crossbow, chain mail, and shield; 

3rd-blh level: hammer, short sword, plate mail and shield; 
?th-9th level: hammer*, short sword*, plate mail*, and shield*; 
3rd'bth/3rd-6th-Ievel priest/thief: any usable*/any usable*; 
7th-9th 7th-9th level priest/thief: any usable* / any usable* 

" 5% chance/level for magical item; for multi-class, add one-half 
of lower level (round up) to the higher level in order to find the 
appropriate multiplier. 

There are non combatant, duergar children equal to 10% of the 
total number of duergar fighters encountered. 

The duergar s stealth imposes a —2 penalty to opponents' sur¬ 
prise rolls; the duergar are surprised only on a 1 on IdlO. Their 
saving throws vs, magical attacks gain a +4 bonus. They are im¬ 
mune to paralysis, illusions phantasm spells and poisons. 

All duergar possess innate magical abilities of enlargement and 
invisibility* They can use these spells as wizards of a level equal 
to their hit points. Duergar can use enlargement to either grow or 
shrink themselves, as well as anything they are wearing or carry¬ 
ing. 

Daylight affects the duergar as follows; their enhanced ability 
to gain surprise is negated. Dexterity is reduced by 2, attacks are 
made with a —2 penalty to the attack roll, and opponents" saving 
throws are made with a +2 bonus. If the encounter occurs when 
the duergar are in darkness, but their opponents are brightly illu¬ 
minated, the duergar's surprise ability and Dexterity are normal, 
but they still suffer a — 1 penalty to their attack rolls while their 
opponents gain a +i bonus to saving throws against attacks, 
Duergar are not adversely affected by the light given off by 
torches, lanterns, magical weapons, or light and faerie fire spells. 

There is a 10% chance that any duergar are accompanied by 
2d4 giant steeders, used as mounts (see Spiders). 

Habitat Society: Duergar society is similar to that of other dwar- 
ven cultures, although life is much harsher because of the hostile 
environment deep underground. They do not venture to the sur¬ 
face except at night or on gloomy days. Duergar life spans can 
reach 400 years.

Elemental, Generic Information 


Elemental* are sentient beings that can possess bodies made of 
one of the four basic elements that make up the Prime Material 
plane—air, earth, fire, or water. They normally reside on an 
elemental Inner Plane and will only be encountered on the 
Prime Material plane if they are summoned by magical means. 
(See Manual of the Planes for more information on the nature 
of 'he various elemental planes.) Each elemental must adopt a 
shell in the Prime Material composed of the basic element it rep¬ 
resents. and once this shell is destroyed, the elemental will re¬ 
turn to its native plane. While there are many more powerful 
and more intelligent residents of the elemental planes, the com¬ 
mon elemental is the easiest to contact, and therefore the most 
frequently summoned. 

Their magical nature gives elemental great protection from at¬ 
tacks on the Prime Material plane. Elemental are not harmed by 
any non magi cal weapons or magical weapons of less than *2 
bonus. Creatures with under four Hit Dice and without any mag¬ 
ical abilities cannot harm an elemental either. (Magical abilities 
include such characteristics as breath weapons, poisons, paraly¬ 
sis, or even being immune to normal weapon attacks.} Ores, for 
example, are powerless against a conjured elemental unless one 
happens to possess a weapon with +2 or better bonus to hit. 

Though elemental do enjoy protection from many non- 
magical attacks in the Prime Material plane, like all extraplanar 
and conjured creatures, elementals are affected by protection 
from evil spells. An elemental cannot strike a creature protected 
by this spell and must recoil from the spells boundaries. How¬ 
ever, the elemental can attack creatures protected by the spell as 
long as it doesn't touch them. For example, a fire elemental could 
set the ground on fire around the creature and wait for the blaze 
to spread. 

Each of the four types of common elemental has its own partic¬ 
ular strengths and weaknesses, attack modes and method of 
movement, depending on its plane of origin. These will be cov¬ 
ered individually, by elemental type, in the next few pages. AIJ 
common elementals share one major characteristic, however. 
They are basically stupid. This low intelligence makes it difficult 
for the elemental to resist a magical summons. But even the com¬ 
mon elemental is bright enough to know it does not like being 
taken off of its home plane and held in the Prime Material plane. 

Summoning an Elemental: There are three basic ways to call an 
elemental to this plane, and the strength of the conjured elemen¬ 
tal depends on the method used to summon it: 

Conjured by spell ____ 8, 12, 16, or 21-24 Hit Dice 


Conjured by staff .... *.16 Hit Dice 

Conjured by summoning device ... 12 Hit Dice 


Obviously the type of wizard or priest spell used to contact an 
elemental will greatly effect the size of the creature on this plane, 
(Sec Player's Handbook for specifics. 1 Also, a conjured efemerv 
tal s height (in feet) is equal to its Hit Dice, so the method of sum¬ 
moning an elemental to the Prime Material plane will also 
determine its size. 

Each individual’* use of any spell, staff, or device in contacting 
the elemental planes produces a unique call. This unique sum¬ 
mons will only be answered by the inhabitants of a particular 
plane once per day. Therefore, each of the methods of summon¬ 
ing elementals—spell, device, and staff—can be used by one per¬ 
son to call only one of any specific type of common elemental per 
day. If a staff is used tour times in one day for example, all tour 
types of elementals must be called once. 

The only exception to this is a character using more than one 
method to call elementals Then, the conjurer can call a number 
of elementals of the same type equal to the number of methods 


he or she uses. This means a person with a device and a statf can 
summon two earth elementals. However, a person with two 
staffs can still summon only one elemental of any specific type 
in one day. 

Controlling an Elemental: Because the elemental will be furious 
at being summoned to this plane, concentration in conjuring the 
creature is vital. In calling an elemental, a person must remain 
perfectly still and focus all of his attention on controlling the be¬ 
ing. Any distraction to the summoner, either mental or physical, 
will result in a failure to control the elemental when it arrives on 
the Prime Material plane. Elementals that are uncontrolled and 
acting upon their own desires are called free-willed. If the party is 
lucky, a free-willed elemental will immediately return to its 
plane. However, this occurs only 25% of the time. 

In most cases (75% of the time), an uncontrolled elemental will 
immediately attack the person or party who conjured it, also de¬ 
stroying anything that stands between tt and its enemies. There is 
no way to gain control ot the elemental once it is lost, and there is 
nothing the objects of the elemental’s wrath can do but defend 
themselves. The elemental s intense dislike of being away from its 
home plane is the only safeguard those conjuring an elemental 
can rely upon if the elemental runs wild. Because remaining on 
the Prime Material plane is painful to any common elemental, 
the uncontrolled elemental will always return to its plane of orb 
gin three turns after control is lost, whether it has destroyed the 
creatures responsible for calling it away from its elemental abode 
or not. 

There is always a 5% chance per round that an elemental is in 
the Prime Material (beginning with the second round! that the 
creature will break control and attack the person who summoned 
it. Also, if a person is wounded, killed, or loses concentration 
while controlling an elemental, the creature will become free- 
willed, The elemental will first attack the person who summoned 
it and then destroy any living thing it can find during the three 
turns after control is lost. The creature will then return to its 
home in the Inner Planes- A free-willed elemental can be sent to 
its home plane if a dismissal spell is cast upon it. but there is only 
a 50% chance of success for the spell in this situation. 

A successfully controlled elemental will stay on the Prime Ma¬ 
terial only for the duration of the spell that summoned it. and it 
can be controlled from a distance up to 30 yards per level of the 
person who summoned it- If under control, an elemental can be 
dismissed by the summoner when its task is complete, 

Stealing Control of an Elemental: Control of a conjured elemen¬ 
tal can be stolen from the person who summoned it by casting 
dispel magic specifically at the magical control over the creature 
(not the elemental itself or the person controlling ith Most of the 
normal rules for dispelling magic apply [Players Handbook p. 
148), However, when dealing with control over an elemental a 
roll of 20 by the person attempting the spell means that all con¬ 
trol has been dispelled and the creature is now free-willed. 

If control of the elemental is stolen, the creature will follow the 
wishes of the new person controlling it as if he or she summoned 
it in the first place. It the dispef magic fails, the elemental will 
immediately be strengthened to its maximum 8 hit points per die 
and the conjurer's ability to control the elemental will be greatly 
enhanced, making any new attempts to steal control of the crea¬ 
ture impossible. Also, the elemental will recognize the person 
who sought to take control of its will as a threat, if the person 
currently guiding the creature loses control, the elemental will 
immediately attack the person who attempted to steal control ot 
its will—even before attacking the person who first summoned it.

Air dementals can be conjured in any area of open air where 
gusts of wind are present. The common air elemental appears as 
an amorphous, shifting cloud when it answers its summons to the 
Prime Material plane. They rarely speak, but their language can 
be heard in the high-pitched shriek of a tornado or the low moan 
of a midnight storm. 

Combat: While air elemental* are not readily tangible to the in¬ 
habitants of planes other than its own, they can strike an oppo¬ 
nent with a strong, focused blast of air that, like a giant, invisible 
fist, does 2-20 points of damage. The extremely rapid rate at 
which these creatures can move make them very useful on vast 
battlefields or in extended aerial combat. In fact, the air elemen¬ 
tal's mastery of its natural element gives it a strong advantage in 
combat above the ground. In aerial battles, they gain a +1 to hit 
and a +4 to the damage they inflict. 

The most feared power of an air elemental is its ability to form 
a whirlwind upon command . Using this form, the air elemental 
appears as a truncated, reversed cone with a 10 foot bottom di¬ 
ameter and 30 foot top diameter. The height of the whirlwind 
depends on the Hit Dice of the elemental. An air elemental of 8 
Hit Dice will produce a whirlwind standing 40 feet tall; a 12 Hit 
Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 60 feet tall: and a 
16 Hit Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 80 feet tall. 
It takes one full turn to form and dissipate this cone. 

This whirlwind lasts for one melee round, sweeps away and 
kills all creatures under 3 Hit Dice in the area of Us cone, and 
does 2-16 points of damage to all creatures it fails to kill outright. 
If, because of overhead obstructions, the whirlwind fails to reach 
its full height it can only sweep up creatures under 2 Hit Dice 
and do 1-8 points of damage to all others in its cone. 

Earth elemental* can be conjured in any area of earth or stone. 
This type of common elemental appears on the Prime Material 



plane as a very large humanoid made of whatever types of dirt, 
stones, precious metals, and gems U was conjured from. It has a 
cold, expressionless face, and its two eyes sparkle like brilliant, 
multifaceted gems. Though it has a mouth-like opening in its 
face, an earth elemental will rarely speak. Their voices can be 
heard in the silence of deep tunnels, the rumblings of earth¬ 
quakes, and the grinding of stone on stone. 

Though earth elemental* travel very slowly they are relentless 
in the fulfillment of their appointed tasks. An earth elemental can 
travel through solid ground or stone with no penalty to move¬ 
ment or dexterity. However, these elemental* cannot travel 
through water: they must either go around the body of water In 
their path or go under it, traveling in the ground. Earth elemen¬ 
tal prefer the latter as it keeps them moving, more or less, in a 
straight line toward their goal. 

Combat: Earth elemental* will always try to fight on the 
ground and will only rarely be tricked into giving up that advan¬ 
tage, Because of their dose alliance to the rock and earth, these 
elemental* do 4-32 points of damage &lt;4d8) whenever they strike a 
creature that rests on the ground. 

Against constructions with foundations in earth or stone, 
earth elemental* do great damage, making them extremely useful 
for armies sieging a fortification. For example, a reinforced door, 
which might require a few rounds to shatter using conventional 
methods, can be smashed with ease by an earth elemental. They 
can even level a small cottage in a few rounds. 

An earth elemental's effectiveness against creatures in the air or 
water is limited; the damage done by the elemental's fists on air¬ 
borne or waterborne targets is lessened by 2 points per die (to a 
minimum of 1 point of damage per die).

Fire elemental can be conjured in any area containing a large 
open flame. To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of 
Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should 
have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four 
feet into the air 

On the Prime Material plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall 
sheet of flame. The fire elemental will always appear to have two 
armlike appendages, one on each side of its body- These arms 
seem to flicker back into the creatures flaming body only to 
spring out from hs sides seconds later. The only Facial features of 
a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue 
fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental* Like all 
common elementals, fire elementals rarely speak on the Prime 
Material plane, though their voices can be heard in the crackle 
and hiss of a large fire* 

Combat: Because they resent being conjured io this plane, fixe 
elementals are fierce opponents who will attack their enemies di¬ 
rectly and savagely taking what joy they can in burning the 
weak creatures and objects of the Prime Material to ashes. In 
combat, a fire elemental lashes out with one of its ever-moving 
limbs, doing 5-24 points of damage. Any flammable object 
struck by the fire elemental must save versus magical fire at a -2 
or immediately begin to burn. 

Fire elementals do have some limitations on their actions in the 
Prime Material plane. They are unable to cross water or non¬ 
flammable liquids. Often, a quick dive into a nearby lake or 
stream is the only thing that can save a powerful party from cer¬ 
tain death from a fire elemental. Also, because their natural abili¬ 
ties give them some built-in resistance to flame-based attacks, 
creatures with innate fire-using abilities, like red dragons, take less 
damage from a fire elemental's attack. The elemental subtracts t 
point from each die of damage it does to these creature (to a mini¬ 
mum of 1 point of damage per die). 

Water elementals can be conjured in any area containing a 



large amount of water or watery liquid. At least one thousand 
cubic feet of liquid is required to create a shell for the water ele¬ 
mental to inhabit. Usually a large poo! serves this purpose, but 
several large kegs of wine or ale will do just as well* 

The water elemental appears on the Prime Material plane as a 
high-crested wave. The elementals arms appear as smaller 
waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms 
ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves, 
Two orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and 
serve the elemental as eyes. Like all other common elementals, 
water elemental rarely speak on the Prime Material plane, but 
their voices can be heard in the crashing of waves on rocky 
shores and the howl of an ocean gale. 

Combat: In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adver¬ 
sary* ll prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can con¬ 
stantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up 
behind its opponent. When the elemental strikes, it lashes out 
with a huge wave-Uke arm, doing 5-30 points of damage. 

Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross 
their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft 
(one ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow 
almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental), 
Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a 
percentage equal to the ratio of ship's tons over the hit points of 
the attacking elemental. 

Though the water elemental is most effective in large areas of 
open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, 
close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the 
movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of 
any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 
yards away from the water it was conjured from* and 1 point of 
damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of 
the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).

Sylphs are beautiful, humanoid women with wings like dragon- 
flies. Their wings are 4-5 feet Jong and translucent, dear, or spot¬ 
ted with iridescent color. Their long, bright, hair may be any 
"normal ' color, or blue, purple, or green. They wear flowing, 
diaphanous robes which accent their wings or hair. 

Sylphs are related to air elemental and to nymphs, perhaps 
originating as a cross-breed between nymphs and aerial servants. 
They speak Common and their own musical language. Sylphs 
are friendly and may (20%) befriend adventurers and give them 
aid in exchange for a favor. 

Combat; Sylphs defend themselves only with magical abilities, A 
sylph can cast spells as a 7th4evel wizard, and most prefer spells 
of elemental air. In addition, the sylph can become invisible at 
will and summon an air elemental once each week. 

Habitat-Society: Sylphs rarely touch ground in the lowlands. 
They are fond of travel, and it is rare to find one near its home. 

Sylph nests are highly individualistic, some formed from 
whatever materials are available, others are elaborate retreats 
perched in tall trees or carved into mountains. Sylphs prefer sim¬ 
ple and light possessions, keeping only gems and magical items as 
treasure. They often trade wealth for furnishings, such as light 
draperies, silks, and pillows, 

There is a 1% chance that a sylph's home holds an egg or a 
child. AH sylphs are female and mate with humanoid males, pre¬ 
ferring elves, but sometimes accepting a human or halfling mate. 
Three months after conception, the sylph lays a pearly egg in a 
special nest, and summons an air elemental to guard tL Six 
months later, the egg hatches a baby girl with wing buds. The 
child grows at the same rate as a human child, gaining magical 
abilities at age five, and full flight by age 10. 

The sylph has the innate ability to levitate; wings are needed 
only to provide thrust. If a sylph's wings are injured, it can only 
glide or hover. Anti-magical attacks may ground a sylph by ne¬ 
gating its power of levitation. Sylphs live for up to 1,000 years, 
retaining their youthful looks throughout their lives. 

Every 28 years, ail sylphs gather in a grand meeting to trade, 
share news, renew- friendships, and welcome young sylphs. 



Ecology: Sylphs usually maintain their distance from the more 
mundane humanoid races, but associate freely with nymphs and 
dryads. Aerial monsters occasionally feed on them, but they are 
in greater danger from evil humanoid males who attempt to cap- 
tore them for dark purposes, 

Aerial Servant 

This creature is a form of air elemental native to the plane of ele¬ 
mental Air, as well as the Ethereal and Astral planes, and can be 
summoned to the Prime Materia) plane by clerics. 

Normally invisible, if seen on their home plane, they resemble 
legless humanoids of sparkling blue smoke, with empty eyes, a 
siash for a mouth, and long, four-fingered hands, 

Aerial servants try to avoid combat on their native planes. It 
has a Strength of 23 and attacks by grabbing and strangling op¬ 
ponents, causing damage with the hit, and in each round, until 
the victim breaks free. A character with exceptional Strength re¬ 
ceives a percentage chance equal to the percentage of exceptional 
Strength. Creatures with 18/00 Strength and above break free 
easily. Creatures with more hit points than the aerial servant can 
likewise break its grasp. Aerial servants penalize opponents sur¬ 
prise rolls by ”5 when invisible. 

A cleric who summons an aerial servant will be attacked unless 
behind a protection from evil, because the servants resent being 
summoned. Otherwise, the servant will complete any duty for 
the cleric, except fighting, as fast as possible. If the servant is pre¬ 
vented from completing its mission, it goes insane and returns to 
kill the summoning cleric. 

Aerial servants are wanderers drawn to areas of extreme 
weather. If caught in a storm, there is a 5% chance it will be 
Mown in two; this is the only way it can reproduce. 

Aerial servants must feed on winds of their home planes at 
least once per month, or suffer ld8 damage per day over 30 that 
they go without feeding.

The pech are creatures of the plane of elemental Earth, though 
some have extensive mines in the deepest regions of the Prime 
Materia) plane. They dwell in dark places and work stone, 

Pech are thin and have long arms and legs. Their broad hands 
and feet are excellent for bracing and employing tools to work 
stone. They have pale, yellowish skin and red or reddish brown 
hair. Their flesh is nearly as hard as granite. Their eyes are large 
and have no pupils. Tech have ixifravtsion to 110 feet. 

Combat: The pech use picks and peat hammers (treat as war 
hammers) for work and armament, and are usually equipped 
with equal numbers of each. Pech have 18/50 Strength. 

Each pech can cast tour stone shape and four sfone tell spells 
per day. Four pech can hand to together to cast a wall of stone 
spell as a 16th-level mage, Eight together can cast a stone to flesh 
spell. Group spells can be cast but once per day by any group. 
Pech are immune to petrification. 

When fighting Ethic monsters such as stone golems, gargoyles, 
or galeb duhr pech are quite capable of knocking them to rubble, 
as their knowledge of stone allows them full attack capability 
against such creatures, even with nonmagical weapons. Each 
successful strike does maximum damage. 

Ha bitabSociety: Pech are basically good and peaceful creatures 
that want to be left to themselves. They hate bright light and 
open skies, and they are quick to ask others to douse lights. Their 
lairs are constructed with numerous choke points so that walls of 
stone can quickly stop intruders. Their lair holds 10-40 individ¬ 
uals, with equal numbers of females and males, and young equal 
to 20-50% of the females. 

Ecology: The pech home plane is hostile, so many travel to the 
Prime Material plane to search for a better life. They have few 
enemies there. Pech do not save large amounts of treasure; they 
mine for things to trade with others for food or services. They do 
sometimes create simple, unobtrusive ornamental objects for 
everyday use, A pech lair may contain 50-100 trade gems plus 5- 
30 dishes and utensils worked from stone and raw metal. These 
items are not very valuable, averaging 150 gp each. 




Sandling 

These creatures are composed of silicates and originated on the 
elemental plane of Earth, They look like piles of sand and can 
vary color to blend with backgrounds, handlings have the same 
temperature as their surroundings, and are immune to sleep, 
charm, hold and other mind-affecting spells or attacks. They 
claim territories with boundaries recognizable only by them. 

Sandlings are not aggressive unless provoked, but guard their 
territories from intruders. If stepped on 4 a sandling reflexively 
lunges upward, trapping 1-2 man-sized opponents: opponents rea¬ 
ctive a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when attacked in this manner. 
If the sandling hits its targets, they are unable to attack or defend 
for ld4 rounds. Sandlings also attack by slashing with an abra¬ 
sive pseudopod. If at least 10 gallons of water are poured on a 
sandling, it is affected as if by a slow spell, and its attacks cause 
only half normal damage. 

Sandlings have no society, and their fierce defense of their ter¬ 
ritories usually precludes cooperation, even with other members 
of their own race. They live on minerals, but despise organic 
matter, always moving several hundred yards from any place 
they have killed an intruder. 

A sandling grows until it reaches its full size, 10 feet in diame¬ 
ter, then reproduces by budding. Sandling buds split from their 
parent when they are about 2 inches long, and an adult's territory 
may swarm with thousands of these creatures. When an Infant 
grows to at least 6 inches in diameter, it either moves off to find 
its own territory, or is hunted and killed by the parent. A group 
of immature sandlings forms a surface with myriad tiny bumps, 
which may trip the unwary, 

Sandlings have little effect on an ecosystem, taking only a frac¬ 
tion of the minerals in any parcel of land. Dwarves sometimes 
seek them in hopes of finding a rich mineral deposit. They are 
said to be excellent ingredients for mortar, but they and many 
druids object to this treatment.

Salamanders are natives of the elemental plane of Fire, and thus 
they thrive in hot places. These cruel, evil creatures come to the 
Prime Material plane for reasons known only to them. 

The head and torso of a salamander is copper-colored and has 
a human-like appearance. Most of the time (&amp;0% L this aspect is a 
male, with flaming beard and moustache. The female version has 
Bowing, fiery red hair, Both aspects have glowing yellow eyes 
that sometimes switch to fluorescent green, All aspects carry a 
shiny metal spear, resembling highly polished steel. 

The lower torso is that of a large snake, with orange coloring 
shading to dull red at the tail end. The entire body is covered 
with wispy appendages thal appear to burn hut are never con¬ 
sumed. 

Combat: A salamander typically attacks with its metal spear, 
which inflicts ld6 points of damage plus a like amount for the 
spear's heat. At the same time, it can lash out and coil around an 
opponent with its snake-like tail, constricting for 2d6 points of 
damage, plus an additional Id6 points of damage from the heat 
ol its body. While fire-resistant creatures do not suffer from the 
salamander s heat damage, they are still subject to the spear and 
constriction damage. 

Salamanders can be affected only by magical weaponry or by 
creatures of a magical nature or those of 4 + 1 or more Hit Dice. 
They are impervious to all fire-based attacks. Sleep, charm , and 
hold spells are ineffective against them. Cold-based attacks cause 
an additional 1 point of damage per die of damage. The head and 
upper body of the salamander has an AC of 5. while the lower 
body is AC 3. 

A favorite salamander tactic, if the creature is encountered in a 
lava pit or roaring fire, is to grab its opponents and hurl them 
into the Barnes, The victim would naturally take damage from 
contact with the salamander, then take even more from being 
thrown inside a roaring conflagration. 

Habitat/Society: Salamanders are native to the elemental plane 
of Fire, They come to the Prime Material plane for reasons 
known only to them, though it is rumored that powerful wizards 
and priests of certain religions can summon them for a short 
time. Salamanders hate cold, preferring temperatures of 300 de¬ 


grees or more: they can abide lower temperatures for only a few 
hours. Their lairs are typically at least 500 degrees. Any treasure 
found there is the sort that can survive this heat, such as swords, 
armor, rods, other ferrous items, and jewels. Things of a com¬ 
bustible nature, such as parchment and wood, soft metals such as 
gold and silver, and liquids, which quickly boil away, are never 
found in salamander lairs. 

Having a nasty disposition and an evil bent, salamanders re¬ 
spect only power, either the ability to resist their fire or the capa¬ 
bility to do great damage. Anyone else is dealt a painful, slow, 
burning death. It is rumored that they have some sort of dealings 
with the efreeti. 

When encountered on the Prime plane, salamanders can be 
found playing in forest fires, lava flows, fire pits, and other areas 
of extreme heat. They usually appear on the Prime plane for a 
purpose, and if in the middle of a task they do not take kindly to 
being interrupted. 


Ecology: These fiery creatures' ichor is useful in the creation of 
potions of fire resistance, and the metal of their spears can be 
used to create rings of fire resistance , 


Fire Snake 

Some sages say that fire snakes are larval salamanders. Fire 
snakes, colored in shades from blood-red to orange, are always 
found in fires. Some large permanent fires contain Id6 of these 
creatures, though in smaller, temporary fires like fire pits and oil 
bowls, there may be but one snake. The only treasure the snakes 
have is the gems they often accumulate. 

Since their color matches their surroundings, they can surprise 
opponents easily {-4 penally to opponents' surprise rolls). Their 
bite inflicts ld4 points o! damage and injects a mild venom that 
causes paralyzation of the victim for 2d4 turns unless a saving 
throw vs. poison is successful.

These creatures from the elemental plane of Water, sometimes 
called "honeyed ones/' are unpredictable and playful; half are 
chaotic neutral, and others tend toward good or evil. Using dis¬ 
guise, nereids lead sailors to their dooms, 

Nereids are transparent in water, 95% undetectable except as 
froth and golden seaweed. Upon contact with air, they assume 
human form, usually as voluptuous young females with long, 
golden hair, pearly white skin, and sparkling green eyes. Their 
voices and songs are lovely, A nereid always carries a white 
shawl, either in its hands or over head and shoulders, and is light¬ 
ly dad in white and gold. If confronted by only females, the ne¬ 
reid appears in a male guise, but a woman has a 65% chance to 
see through the disguise. All males who see a nereid are incapable 
of harming U (no saving throw). 

Combat: Nereids can spit venom 20 feet, blinding a target for 2d6 
rounds if it hits; the venom can be washed away with water. A 
blinded victim s attack rolls, saving throws, and AC are all wors¬ 
ened by 4 until the effects wear off. 

Nereids can control mater within 30 feet; it can use waves to 
slow movement to V* normal, increase chances of drowning by 
10% r or crash with a roar that deafens characters within 60 feet 
for 3d4 rounds if precautions are not taken, Nereids can also 
form the water to look like a water weird, and cause it to strike as 
a 4 HD monster and inflict ld4 points of damage, 

A nereid is 85% likely to have a pet for protection, with equal 
chances for a giant eel, giant otter, giant poisonous snake, giant 
octopus, giant squid, dolphin, giant leech, or sting ray* 

If the nereid makes a successful saving throw vs, poison, she 
can (low like water, avoiding weapon damage or escaping a cap- 
tor, The neresd's kiss causes a man to drown, unless he makes a 
successful saving throw vs. breath weapon, with a -2 penalty. If 
he lives, he finds ecstacy. 

The nereid protects its shawl at all costs, for it contains the 
nereid s essence; if it is destroyed, the nereid dissolves into form¬ 
less water. Possession of a nereid's shawl gives a character con¬ 
trol over the creature, which will accept commands to avoid 
damage to the shawl. Stories tell ol forlorn nereids who follow 
the ships of a powerful foes who have stolen their shawls, A ne¬ 
reid will lie and attempt anything short of violent action to regain 
its soul-shawl. 



Habitat/Sodety; A nereid found on the Prime Material plane has 
either escaped or been exiled from its home plane. Though usu¬ 
ally solitary, a small group of nereids with the same alignment 
sometimes live together, led by the eldest. 

Polluted waters drain nereids J vigor, and even good nereids 
may attack those who pollute their lairs, Nereids do not value 
metals, but save any magical treasure they gain. The nereid has 
no goals or ambitions other than cavorting in water. 

Ecology; Nereid shawls command handsome sums, but are sel¬ 
dom sold and are very rare, One who holds a shawl can use the 
enslaved nereid as a guide on the plane of Water. 

Water Weird 

These strange creatures from the plane of Water are hostile when 
encountered on the Prime Material plane, as they are usually 
magically kept from going home* If communication is achieved, 
a bargain can sometimes be struck with the creature. 

Water weirds appear to be common water; a detect invisibility 
reveals something amiss, but not the nature of the threat, When a 
water weird detects a living being, it assumes serpentine form 
(this takes two rounds). It attacks as a 6 HD creature; those hit 
must make a successful saving throw vs* paralyzation, or be 
pulled into the water. Each round spent in the water requires an¬ 
other saving throw; failure indicates death by drowning, which 
releases energy that the water weird consumes. A water weird 
that comes in contact with a normal water elemental has a 50% 
chance to usurp control of it. 

Water weirds take only I hp damage from piercing and slash¬ 
ing weapons* The take half damage from fire, none if they make 
a successful saving throw. Intense cold acts as a skrm spell on 
water weirds. If reduced to 0 hp or less, a water weird is disrupt¬ 
ed, and it reforms in two rounds, A purify water spell will in¬ 
stantly kill a single water weird.

The tempest is a living storm which appears as a dark storm 
cloud of comparatively small size. Human or bestial features can 
often be seen in the roiling vapors of the tempest. Silver veins 
extend across the creature and carry the electrical impulses that 
maintain the storm’s energy. 

Tempests have no language that humans may learn. They can 
communicate with air and water elementals and their kin, and 
genies, through subtle wind buffets and spatterings of precipita¬ 
tion. A few, perhaps 10%, have learned to speak a few words of 
Common, Their voices are very soft and sibilant, with a hint of 
malice behind the words. 

Combat: Tempests are territorial and consider any violation of 
their airspace to be a direct challenge. They feed on moisture 
from animals and often hunt in and around their territories. They 
have a number of innate abilities which they can use to make life 
miserable for other creatures. Unless otherwise specified, all spe¬ 
cial abilities are used as if the tempest were a 9th-level wizard. A 
tempest can make two attacks each round, one using its wind 
powers and one using its lightning power, 

Once per round, a tempest can use wind wall or gust of wind , 
or may attack with a strong wind buffet for 2-16 points of dam¬ 
age. Alternately, it may create a small whirlwind, which is coni¬ 
cal in shape, 10 feet in diameter at the bottom, and 30 feet in 
diameter at the top, The whirlwind can be up to 50 feet high, and 
must connect to the tempest's main body. 

The tempest takes one full round to create the whirlwind, 
which can cover an area of 100 square feet per round. Within that 
area, it automatically sweeps away and kills all creatures with 
less than 2 Hit Dice, and causes 2d6 points of damage to all crea¬ 
tures which it fails to kill outright. 

Tempests may also use their powers over the air to penalize 
missile attacks by - 6, or to batter down flying creatures, causing 
falling damage to flying creatures that fail to make a successful 



saving throw 1 vs. paralyzation. 

A tempest can also cast a lightning bolt once per round, at one 
victim. The lightning bait causes one die of damage per Hit Die of 
the tempest. A victim of a lightning attack can make a saving 
throw vs. spells; if successful, the victim takes only half damage. 
The tempest's Jjjgfcfrimg boh is like the 3rd-leve! wizard spell in 
other respects, having a length of SO feet, setting fire to combusti¬ 
bles, melting metals, and shattering barriers. An exceptionally 
hungry or perturbed tempest may use lightning to destroy an en¬ 
tire building to reach the creatures inside. 

Tempests can also use a chilling wind to affect opponents, 
causing damage as a chill touch spell. Id4 points of damage and 
the loss of 1 point of Strength, unless the victim makes a success¬ 
ful saving throve vs, spells. This attack takes the place of either an 
electrical attack or another wind attack. 

A tempest can produce up to 20 gallons of rain per round if it 
concentrates and forgoes other attacks while raining. While pre¬ 
cipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout its area, the 
tempest can concentrate the fall to fill a hole, wash out a bridge, 
or otherwise harm its victims. 

Tempests are immune to wind, gas. and water attacks, and 
take only half damage from electrical or cold-based attacks. 
They are immune to all weapons of less than +2 enchantment. 

Habitat/Society: There is much speculation about the origin of 
these beings* who are apparently related to dementab and to 
genie-kind. Tempests are composed of all four basic elements, 
fire, earth, air* and water; fire in the form of lightning* earth in 
their silver "circulatory system," air in their winds* and water in 
the form of rain. They may be summoned accidentally when a 
spellcaster tries to summon an elemental, especially one of air or 
water. At the DM's option, when a summoning is interfered with, 
the caster may be given a 10%-50% chance to summon a tem¬ 
pest. These beings may also be attracted by a weather sum mov¬ 
ing spell, with a 1% (non-cumulative) chance of appearing each 
time a spell is cast. 


IDS 


















Elemental, Composite 


Some sages believe these creatures are jarm that have been in¬ 
jured in some way and cannot retain human form. Whatever 
their origin, they do breed and reproduce as storms Though 
‘male and ‘female'’ do not truly describe the different types of 
tempests, there are two genders. When living storms of different 
genders meet, they have a brief, tempestuous affair, causing a 
great conflagration that may last more than a week. Hurricanes 
or tornadoes are produced irregularly from the mass, to wreak 
havoc upon the surrounding area. 

When the storm finally breaks, the two tempests leave the ar¬ 
ea, and the residue they leave behind forms Ld4 infant tempests. 
These infant storms, sometimes referred to as tantrums, often 
travel together until they reach maturity, one year after birth. 
The young storms have 6 Hit Dice each, and can use only the gust 
of wind power, besides producing rain. 

Most tempests quite naturally seem to have very stormy dispo¬ 
sitions. Their hunger for animal life goes beyond their need for 
the moisture contained in animal bodies. Some sages speculate 
that their physical form, or possibly some event in their history, 
causes them to hate animal life. It is quite possible that the electri¬ 
cal impulses produced by animal brains cause pain to the tem¬ 
pest. 

Tempests may be related to skriaxits, the living sandstorms of 
some worlds' deserts. No tempest has ever been known to en¬ 
counter a skriaxit and their relationship and possible interac¬ 
tions are completely unknown. 

Ecology: Tempests Feed on the moisture found in animal bodies. 
Though unable to cause harm to living creatures by draining 
their moisture, they hover dose to the ground after a battle to 
suck the water from dead opponents, as well as any water they 
may have precipitated during the battle. They are sometimes 
found scavenging after great battles between humans. By remov¬ 
ing water from a corpse, they render it inviable to return to life 
via a raise dead spell, though resurrection and other spells work 
normally. 

When a tempest is killed, a silver residue rains down from its 
form. If carefully gathered, this residue provides a mass of silver 
equivalent to 3d6 silver pieces. Though valuable as a precious 
metal, the silver can also be used as a component in making a 
wand of lightning or casting a weather-related spell. Bits of the 
silver are also useful for making other weather or elemental re¬ 
lated magical items. 

Genies and elemental are enemies of tempests; they often at¬ 
tack them, and tempests respond in like manner, However, some 
genies, especially djinn and marids, keep tempests as pets, train¬ 
ing them as guards and to attack. 

Tempests can be quite devastating to a local ecology if 
annoyed, and can cause great damage with wind, rain, and other 
attack forms. Living storms are never found inside buildings or 
underground. 

Skriaxit 

Skriaxits, also called blackstorms or living sandstorms, are the 
most feared creatures in many deserts. Spirits of retribution sum¬ 
moned millennia ago by ancient gods, blaekstorms combine the 
elements of earth and air to dangerous effect. They are, fortu¬ 
nately, only rarely active, They speak the tongue of air elemen- 
tals and their own language, a howling, shrieking tongue that 
frightens most humans who hear il. 

Much like very large versions of the dust devils created by the 
wizard s spell blaekstorms take the sand and the dust of the des¬ 
ert and whirl it to create their 10-foot-tall conical forms. At rest, 
a skriaxit appears to be a wind-scattered pile of black dust* As a 


pack, they create their greatest terror, generating high winds and 
a fierce sandstorm that can render a human fleshless in minutes. 

Combat: Skriaxits move by generating a large vortex of wind 
that propels them at high speeds. If there are 1-6 skriaxits togeth¬ 
er, their speed is 12; 7-12 skriaxits have a speed of 18; if there are 
13 or more skriaxits, their speed is 24. The skriaxit vortex creates 
a sandstorm in a 200-yard radius around them; those caught in 
this storm suffer 1 point of damage per round per skriaxit (so if 
there are 12 skriaxits in a pack, victims take 12 points of damage 
per round* 

Within this sandstorm, the skriaxit pack constantly dispels 
magic as a 16th~leve! wizard. 

Each skriaxit can form its winds into razor sharp lashes, inflict¬ 
ing 2dl0 points of damage on a successful strike. 

Though they were originally summoned from the elemental 
plane of Air* they have merged with earthy and the Prime Materi¬ 
al plane is now their home* Thus, they cannot be sent to an ele¬ 
mental plane by a holy word or similar magic. No known magic 
can control them, though they are susceptible to wards against 
air dementals. 

Each skriaxit pack is led by a Great Skriax, the most evil mem¬ 
ber of the pack. This creature has 24 +24 Hit Dice and gains a +4 
bonus to attack and damage rolls. 

Habitat Society; Skriaxits are highly intelligent, but extremely 
evil, elemental, combinations of the elements of air and earth, 
They hate and fear nothing, but simply delight in destruction. 
They feed on terror and destruction; once they have caused 
enough catastrophe, they sleep For ld3 centuries* While asleep, 
they cannot be affected in any way by any being. They reawaken 
when hungry. They view humans, demihumans, and humanoids 
as playthings, with the same sadistic attitude as a human child 
playing with a fly* They may amuse themselves by listening to 
humans bargain with them, but humans have nothing of interest 
to offer them* 

Ecology: Skriaxits teed upon the emotions of terror and fear they 
generate in those they destroy and kill. 

Arctic Tempest 

This is a variety of tempest found only in arctic regions and some 
of the colder temperate lands. While they are similar to tempests 
in most respects, their special powers differ* They cannot use the 
whirlwind or lightning bolt powers of the standard tempest. In¬ 
stead, they can either cause snow to fall or cast ice storm spells. 
The arctic tempest usually uses a hail form of ke storm * but may 
use sleet instead, it can cause very cold snow to fall, inflicting 
9d4+9 points of cold damage to those beneath it. Victims who 
make a successful saving throw vs* spells suffer only half damage 
from the attack. 

Like the standard tempest, the arctic variety can make only- 
two attacks per round, one using a wind power, such as gust of 
wind or wind wall, and one using a cold-based power, such as ice 
storm or cause snow. It may also substitute an electrical attack 
for either of its normal attacks, causing damage as a shocking 
grasp spell for ld8 + 9 points of damage. 

Black Cloud of Vengeance 

This living storm* usually found in deserts, combines the ele¬ 
ments of fire and air. It unleashes a fiery rain which causes 7dlD 
damage to all beneath it* though a successful saving throw vs. 
breath weapon halves the damage, ft then fans the flames, and 
will they continue to burn as long as there is fuel.

Elephants have thick, baggy hides, covered with sparse and very coarse 
tufts of gray hair* The elephant's most renowned feature is iLs trunk, 
which it uses as a grasping limb, 

Combat: An elephant can make up to five attacks at one time in a bat- 
tie. It can do stabbing damage of 2-16 points (2dS) with each of Us two 
tusks: constricting damage of 2-12 points with its trunk; and 2-12 points 
of trampling damage with each of its from feet. No single opponent can 
be subject to more than two of these attacks at any one time* However, 
the elephant can battle up to six man-sized opponents at one time. 

Creatures larger than ogre-sized are not subject to the elephants trunk 
attack. Also an elephant will never attempt to grasp anything that might 
harm Us trunk—like an object covered with sharp spikes. Elephants 
greatly fear fire. 

Habitat.Society: Elephants are peaceful herbivores that travel in a herd. 
The herd is made up o! both male and female elephants, as well as their 
young. If a herd of 10 or more elephants is encountered, there will be 1-4 
young, from 20% to 70% mature, with the group. In the herd, a dear 
hierarchy exists, with the older males in a dear position of dominance. 

Occasionally, an older male elephant will be beaten by a rival in the 
herd. The defeated elephant must then leave the group, at which point it 
becomes a violent rogue.' Rogue elephants encountered alone are 90% 
likely to attack, and will have no fewer than 6 hit points per hit die. 

Ecology: Elephants are commonly captured when young and trained. 
They make good beasts of burden, but are often used in warfare as 
mounts and living battering rams, as well. 

Elephant tusks are worth 100 to 600 hundred gold pieces each, or about 
4 gp per pound. In areas heavily populated by elephants, a substantial 
trade in this ivory will be common. 

Mammoths: This ancestor of the elephant was common during the 
Pleistocene era. Mammoths are covered with thicker, woolier hair than 
the modern elephant, and they are considerably larger. Mammoths are 
much more aggressive than elephants and will attack with less provoca¬ 
tion. Because they are heavier, a mammoth's tusks are worth 50% more 
than an elephants. Mammoths are rare when encountered outside of a 
Pleistocene campaign, and will only be found in subarctic plains. 

Mastodons: Like the mammoth, the mastodon is an ancestor of the ele¬ 
phant that was common in the Pleistocene era, when they roamed from 
subarctic to tropical plains* They are larger than the modem elephant, 
hairier, and somewhat greater in length. Encountered outside of a Pleisto¬ 
cene campaign, mastodons are rare, and found only in subarctic plains. 


Oliphants; The oliphant is a modern-day mastadon. with shaggy hair 
and tusks that curve down. The oliphants trunk is too short to be used in 
combat. This limits the number of man-sized opponents an oliphant can 
attack at one time to four, Oliphants are more intelligent than elephants 
and do not share its cousins 1 unreasoning tear of fire. They are also very 
aggressive, and when properly trained and fed, oliphants grow to greater 
bulk (10+5 Hit Dice) than their wild counterparts. These trained oli¬ 
phants are excellent for combat duty and have a morale of 10. An oli- 
phant’s tusks are worth 100 to 400 gold pieces each, or about 4 gp per 
pound, bul are smaller than an elephant s.

Though their lives span several human generations, elves appear 
at first glance to be frail when compared to man. However, elves 
have a number of special talents that more than make up for their 
slightly weaker constitutions. 

High elves, the most common type of elf, are somewhat short¬ 
er than men, never growing much over than 5 feet tall. Male elves 
usually weigh between 90 and 120 pounds, and females weigh 
between 70 and 100 pounds. Most high elves are dark-haired, 
and their eyes are a beautiful, deep shade of green. They posses 
infra vision up to 60 feet. The features of an ell are delicate and 
finely chiseled. 

Elves have very pale completions, which is odd because they 
spend a great deal of time outdoors. They tend to be slim, almost 
fragile. Their pale complexion and slight builds are the result of a 
constitution that is weaker than mans. Elves, therefore, always 
subtract 1 point from their initial Constitution score. Though 
they are not as sturdy as humans, elves are much more agile, and 
always add 1 point to their initial Dexterity scores. Elven cloth¬ 
ing Lends to be colorful, but not garish. They often wear pastel 
colors, especially blues and greens. Because they dwell in forests, 
however, high elves often wear greenish grey cloaks to afford 
them quick camouflage. 

Elves have learned that it is very important to understand the 
creatures, both good and evil, that share their forest home. Be¬ 
cause of this, elves may speak the tongues of goblins, ores, hob¬ 
goblins. gnolis, gnomes, and half lings, in addition to common 
and their own highly-developed language. They will always 
show an interest in anything that will allow them to communi¬ 
cate with, and learn from, their neighbors. 

Combat: Elves are cautious fighters and always use their 
strengths to advantage if possible. One of their greatest strengths 
is the ability to pass through natural surroundings, woods, or 
forests, silently and almost invisibly. By moving quietly and 
blending into vegetation for cover, elves will often surprise a per¬ 
son or party (opponents have a surprise modifier of -4). As long 
as they are not attacking, the elves hiding in the forest can only 
be spotted by someone or something with the ability to see invisi¬ 
ble objects. The military value of this skill ls immense, and elven 
armies will always send scouts to spy on the enemy, since such 
spies are rarely caught-or even seen. 

Although their constitutions are weak, elves posses an ex¬ 
tremely strong will, such strong wills, in fact, that they have a 



90% immunity to all charm and sleep spells . And even if their 
natural resistance to these spells fails, they get a norma! saving 
throw'-making it unlikely an elf will fall victim to these spells 
very often. 

Elves live in the wild, so weapons are used for everything from 
dealing with the hostile creatures around their camps, to such 
mundane tasks as hunting for dinner. The elves' rigorous training 
with bows and swords, in addition to their great dexterity, gives 
them a natural bonus of +1 to hit when fighting with a short or 
long sword, or when using a bow of any kind, other than a cross¬ 
bow. Elves are especially proficient in the use of the bow. Be¬ 
cause of their agility, elves can move, fire a bow, and move 
again, all in the same round. Their archers are extremely mobile, 
and therefore dangerous. 

Because of limitations of horses in forest combat, elves do not 
usually ride. Elves prefer to fight as foot soldiers and are gener¬ 
ally armed as such. Most elves wear scale, ring, or chain mail, 
and almost all high elves carry shields. Although elves have natu¬ 
ral bonuses when they use bows and swords, their bands carry a 
variety of weapons. The weapons composition of a band of elves 
is: spear 30%; sword 20%; sword and spear 20%; sword and 
bow 10%; bow 15%; two-handed sword 5%, 

Elven fighters and multi-class fighters have a 10% chance per 
level to possess a magical item of use to his or her class, This 
percentage is cumulative and can be applied to each major type 
of magical item that character would use-far each class in the 
case of multi-class characters. (For example, a fighter/priest of 
level 4 or 5 would have a 40% chance to have a magical item 
useful to fighters and a 50% chance of having an item useful to 
priests.) In addition, if above 4th level, elven mages gain the 
same percentage chance to gain items, but gain 2-5 magical items 
useful fro them if a successful roll is made. 

For every 20 elves in a group, there will be one 2nd- or 3rd- 
level fighter (50% chance oi either). For every party of 40 elves, 
and in addition to the higher level fighter, there will be a 1st- or 
2nd-level mage (again, 50% chance of either). If 100 or more 

108 







Elf 


elves are encountered, the following additional characters will be 
present: two 4th-level tighter: one 8th-)evel mage; and a 4th-level 
fighter/4th-level mage'4th-level thief. Finally, if over 160 elves 
are encountered, they will be led by Iwo 6th-level fighter/6th- 
level mage/6th-level thief . These two extremely powerful leaders 
will have two retainers each-a 4th-Ievel fighter/Sth-level mage, 
and a 3rd-level fighter 3rd-level mage/3rd-leve! thief. All of 
these are in addition to the total number of elves in the band. 

Elven women are the equal of their male counterparts in all 
aspects of warfare. In fact, some bands of elves will contain units 
of female fighters, who will be mounted on unicorns. This occurs 
rarely (5% chance), and only 10-30 elf maidens will be encoun¬ 
tered in such a unit. However, the legends of the destruction 
wrought by these elven women are rampant among the enemies 
of the elves. 

Habitat-Society: Elves value their individual freedom highly and 
their social structure is based on independent bands. These small 
groups, usually consisting of no more than 200, recognize the au¬ 
thority of a royal overlord, who in turn owes allegiance to a king 
or queen. However, the laws and restraints set upon elven society 
are very few compared to human society and practically negligi¬ 
ble when compared to dwarven society. 

Elven camps are always well-hidden and protected. In addition 
to the large number of observation posts and personnel traps set 
around a camp, high elves typically set 2-12 giant eagles as 
guardians of their encampments (65% of the time). For every 40 
elves encountered in a camp, there will be the following high 
level elves, as well as the leaders noted above: a 4th-level fighter, 
a 4th-level cleric, and a 2nd-level fighter/2nd-Ievel mage/2nd- 
level thief. A 4th-level fighter/7th-level mage, a 5th-level fighter, 
a 6th-level fighter, and a 7th-level cleric will also be present. Fe¬ 
males found in a camp will equal 100%, children 50%, of the 
males encountered. 

Because elves live for several hundred years, their view of the 
world is radically different from most other sentient beings. Elves 
do not place much importance on short-term gains nor do they 
hurry to finish projects. Humans see this attitude as frivolous; 
the elves simply find it hard to understand why everyone else is 
always in such a rush. 

Elves prefer to surround themsel ves with things that will bring 
them joy over long periods of time^lhings like music and nature. 
The company of their own kind is also very important to elves, 
since they find it hard to share their experiences or their perspec¬ 
tives on the world with other races. This is one of the main rea¬ 
sons elven families are so close. However, as friendship, too is 
something to be valued, even friends of other races remain 
friends forever. 

Though they are immune to a few specific Spells, elves are cap¬ 
tivated by magic. Mot specif ic spells, of course, but the very con¬ 
cept of magic. Cooperation is far more likely to be had from an 
elf , by offering an obscure, even worthless, (but interesting) mag¬ 
ical item, than it is with two sacks of gold. Ultimately, their radi¬ 
cally different perspective separates the elves from the rest of 
their world. Elves find dw-arves too dour and their adherence to 
strict codes of law unpleasant. However, elves do recognize 
dwarven craftsmanship as something to be praised. Elves think a 
bit more highly of humans, though they see man's race after 
wealth and fleeting power as sad. In the end, after a few hundred 
years, aH elves leave the world they share with dwarves and men, 
and journey to a mysterious land where they live freely for the 
rest of their extremely long lives. 


Ecology: Elves produce fine clothes, beautiful music, and bril¬ 
liant poetry. It is for these things that other cultures know the 
folk of the forest best. In their world within the forest, however, 
elves hold in check the dark forces of evil, and the creatures that 
would plunder the forest and then move on to plunder another. 
For this reason alone, elves are irreplaceable. 

Grey Elves (Faerie! 

Grey elves have either silver hair and amber eyes, or pale golden 
hair and violet eyes (the violet-eyed ones are known as faerie 
elves). They favor bright garments of white, gold, silver, or yel¬ 
low, and wear cloaks of deep blue or purple. Grey elves are the 
rarest of elves, and they have little to do with the world outside 
their forests. They value intelligence very highly, and, unlike oth¬ 
er elves, devote much time to study and contemplation. Their 
treatises on nature are astounding. 

Grey elves value their independence from what they see as the 
corrupting influence of the outside world, and will fight fiercely 
to maintain their isolation. All grey elves carry swords, and most 
wear chain mail and carry shields. For mounts, grey elves will 
ride hippogriffs (70%) or griffons (30%) Those that ride griffons 
will have 3-12 griffons for guards in their camps, instead of giant 
eagles. 

Wood Elves 

Also called sylvan elves, wood elves are the wild branch of the elf 
family. They are slightly darker in complexion than high elves, 
their hair ranges in color from yellow to coppery-red. and their 
eyes are light brown, light green, or hazel. They wear clothes of 
dark browns and greens, tans and russets, to blend in with their 
surroundings. Wood elves are very independent and value 
strength over intelligence. They will avoid contact with strangers 
75% of the time. 

In battle, wood elves wear studded leather or ring mail and 
50% of their band will be equipped with bows. Only 20% of 
wood elves carry swwds. and only 40% use spears. Wood elves 
prefer to ambush their enemies, using their ability to hide in the 
forest until their foes are dose a! hand. In most cases (70%), 
wood elf camps are guarded by 2-8 giant owls (80% ) or by 1-6 
giant lynx (20%). These elves speak only elf and the languages of 
some forest animals, and the treant. Wood elves are more in¬ 
clined toward neutrality than good, and are not above killing 
people who stumble across their camps. In order to keep their 
locations secret. 

Half-Elves 

Half-elves are of human stock, and have features of both the elf 
and human parents. They are slightly taller than common elves 
growing as tall as 5 Vz feet and weighing up to 150 pounds. 
Though they do not gain the natural sword or bow bonuses from 
their elven relatives, but they do have normal elven infravision. 

A half-elf can travel freely between most elven and human 
settlements, though occasionally prejudice will be a problem. 
The half-clfs life span is their biggest source of grief, however. 
Since a half-elf lives more than 125 years, he or she will outlive 
any human friends or relatives, but grow old too quickly to be a 
real part of elven society, Many half-elves deal with this by trav¬ 
eling frequently between the two societies, enjoying life as it 
comes; the best of both worlds. Half-elves may speak common, 
elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, ore, and gnolh

Beneath the crashing waves of wild coastlines lives the sea-elf, 
aquatic cousin of the woodland elves in conduct and outlook. 

Aquatic elves live for many centuries, and their eyes often 
show the effects of such great age. Otherwise, sea elves show lit¬ 
tle evidence of aging. They have gill slits on either side of their 
throats, and greenish-silver skin. Their hair Is usually stringy, 
and emerald green to deep blue in color. Males usually wear their 
hair short , but females allow their hair to reach as much as 4 feet 
in length. Unlike mermen, aquatic elves have kgs and usually 
wear clothes woven from underwater plants and reeds. Their 
dress is quite intricate, most often of greens, blacks, and browns 
woven in subtle, swirling designs. Sea elves speak elvish, sa- 
huagin, and an oddly accented common. 

Combat: Sea elves are a peaceful culture. It is a rare sight to see 
an aquatic eh launch an attack, and rarer still for an entire band 
to prepare for war, Sea elves will leave their homes to go to battle 
only when the entire community is in danger, or against great 
enemies. When forced to war, they impress all opponents with 
their fierce bravery and skill. 

If given their choice of battlefield, aquatic elves would prefer 
to fight in a bed of seaweed, or on the reefs, where their natural 
coloration and stealth skills can give them the chance to hide 
from their enemies. They can become as invisible in seaweed as 
their woodland cousins can in the forests, imposing a - 5 penalty 
to their opponent's surprise roll. Sea elves enjoy the ability to 
move unhindered through seaweed, giving them tremendous ad¬ 
vantages m maneuverability. While they lack the infravision of 
their land-based cousins, they can see dearly at amazing dis¬ 
tances, An aquatic elf can count the troops of an enemy at dis¬ 
tances of up to 1 mile. 

Their preferred weapons are the trident and the spear. These 
are used for hunting as well as for combat. The trident and spear 
are wielded so well by sea elves, that they receive a + I bonus to 
their attack roll w hen using them. They will also use combat nets 
against their enemies. These off-hand weapons will bind an op¬ 
ponent if the wieider rolls a successful attack against AC 6, (Be¬ 
cause of their great Dexterity aquatic elves do not suffer a 
penalty to the attack roll for the nets.) Half the time, only a vic¬ 
tims weapon (including natural weapons, like a sharks teeth) 
will be entangled in the net. The rest of the time, the victim is 
trapped. A netted victim must either break the net (a bend bars 
roll) or disentangle himself (a Dexterity check with at a -3 pen¬ 



alty) to get free. Magical gestures are impossible in a net. 

On some worlds, sea elves are unable to cast spells. The rea¬ 
sons for this are unknown, but there is a legend among these nem- 
magical sea elves that the drow stole this ability from them, long 
ages ago. 

Like their surface counterparts, aquatic elves demonstrate 
strong resistance to sleep and charm spells. Aquatic elves also 
have a 90% immunity against charm person spells. And even if 
their natural resistance to sleep and charm spells fails, aquatic 
elves still get a normal saving throw. 

In combat, leadership is divided according to the size of Lhe 
war party For every 20 elves in a band, there is an additional 
3rd-kvel fighter. For every 40 elves, there is an additional 4th- 
level fighter. In a force numbering over 100, there will be an 8th- 
level fighter and tw*o 5th-level lieutenants (in addition to the 3rd- 
and 4tb-Ievel fighters above), A combat unit of more than 160 
elves are accompanied by a 9th-level fighter and a 6th-kve! thief , 
in addition to their original numbers. 

Sea elves befriend dolphins and employ them as companions 
and comrades-in-arms. In any party of at least 20 sea elves, 
there's a 50% chance for them to be accompanied by ld3 dol¬ 
phins. The dolphins are companions, however, they are neither 
pets nor cannon fodder. When danger threatens, dolphins join 
the combat as willing allies. 

Battle tactics of the sea elves differ from one band to another, 
but common strategies include the following: 

A charge from directly beneath an opponent. This is particularly 
effective against unwanted visitors from the surface, who are un¬ 
accustomed to being attacked from below. If the elf launched this 
attack from a bed of seaweed, he might well escape back to cover 
before his opponents could react, 

A beaching, usually by more than one elf. Sea elves can sur¬ 
vive on land for a few minutes at a time, though in a state of 
growing discomfort. Many of their opponents, like sharks, can¬ 
not, Several elves may attempt to wrestle an opponent to the 
beach, taking it well away from the ocean. 


10 






Elf, Aquatic 


Traps, Beds of seaweed and coral reefs are excellent staging ar¬ 
eas for all manner of spring-loaded booby-traps, nets, and per¬ 
haps magical entrapments designed and built by surface elves in 
return tor favors. Predators have often decided to turn toward 
easier prey after encountering a sea elf band's defenses. 

Habitat Society: Small communities of 3dIQ0 + JOO normal in¬ 
habitants are the rule of aquatic elven lifestyle. These communi¬ 
ties are often found in heavy weed beds in sheltered waters, 
though the aquatic elves may fashion homes in caverns in lagoon 
bottoms and coral reefs. Sea elf communities keep in touch with 
each other through an elaborate and inefficient custom of wan¬ 
dering herald messengers who travel from one band to another 
much like postal carriers transmitting oral messages. In each 
community, there are several leader-types, as outlined earlier, 
ruled over by a fighter of 10th-12th level, with a personal guard 
of eight ?th-level elf fighters. Magical weapons would be carded 
by the leader or one of his guards. 

Aquatic elves are an anti-social race. They avoid air-breathers 
as well as other races that dwell beneath the waves. Their cities 
are usually carved from the rock beneath beds of seaweeds, prac¬ 
tically invisible to non-elves, A character has the same opportu¬ 
nity to find a sea elf community as he has to detect a secret door. 

As independent as the freedom-loving elves are of each others' 
communities, they live in even greater isolation from the rest of 
the undersea races, whom they would rather not deal with. Al¬ 
though the aquatic elves see nothing wrong with the mermen, the 
tritons, and other good-aligned undersea races, the elves see no 
reason to involve themselves in the problems of such transitory 
peoples. It is part of the elven philosophy to let others go about 
their business with a minimum of interruption; aquatic elves 
would prefer it if others returned the favor. 

Those aquatic elves who are willing to deal with non-elves are 
highly insulted if the non-elves expresses any lack of confidence 
in the sea elf's word. An aquatic elf who makes a promise will 
carry out his obligation unto death, Should he be killed before he 
can succeed, his entire band will work to see that the promise is 
fulfilled. On the other hand, aquatic elves do not accept promises 
from non-elven characters. The sea elves know that they are the 
only race with the honor to carry out the duties of its dead mem¬ 
bers, And, besides, only elves live long enough to guarantee that 
they will have the time to fulfill a vow. 

Dolphins are one of the tew creatures the sea elves genuinely 
tike. There are 3do +2 dolphins swimming about most aquatic elf 
bands, providing one of the few' clues as to where the elven cities 
are located. Aquatic elves are also fairly fond of land elves. It is 
uncertain how closely related the two races are, although mat¬ 
ings between land elves and aquatic elves produce elves with the 
coloring of high elves, but with greenish hair. As they have hid¬ 
den gill slits that open up when they dive under the surface, these 
elves can breathe either air or water indefinitely The attitudes 
and abilities of these half-breeds depend upon whether they were 
reared in the forests or the rich kelp beds, with individuals in¬ 
clined (65%) to follow the lifestyles of their mothers. 

Sea elves have an outlook on the world that comes from long 
lives among quiet natural beauty. Even with magical assistance to 
enable them to breathe air, aquatic elves are uncomfortable 
above the waves, and so very few have seen the forests that the 
high elves speak of with such enthusiasm. But there are few 
aquatic elves who w ould not like to take the impossible trip over¬ 
land to see the wonders of a forest first-hand. 


Sea elves hate sahuagin. This isn't much of a surprise, as al¬ 
most every undersea race, with the exception of the perverse ix- 
itachitls. hates the sea-devils. But sea elves generate a passion for 
conflict with the sahuagin that surprises even themselves. Aquat¬ 
ic elves leave their sheltered bands in war parties if they have 
reason to suspect that sahuagin are dwelling nearby. Should a 
party of sea elves encounter sahuagin. the former nearly always 
attack if they outnumber their hated foes. Aquatic elves also 
make it a point to kill any great sharks in their territory. 

Sea elves have no other major enemies, but they dislike 
surf ace-dwelling fishermen, due to the numbers of sea elves 
snared in nets, or mistakenly killed as sahuagin by these ignorant 
humans. 

The sea elves have legends that speak of far-away undersea 
elves who have learned to shapechange into sea otters or dol¬ 
phins. There have been search parties motivated by these tales, 
but no such elves have ever been found. 

Ecology: Each band of sea elves is self-sufficient, raising their 
kelp and hunting fish when necessary. 

Sea elves scavenge. They are enchanted by the idea of magic, 
but they realize that land elves are more equipped to deal with it. 
They often trade rare or decorative items they have found to the 
high elves in exchange for metal weapons and took, which they 
cannot forge underwater. 

Aquatic elves are valuable sources of information regarding 
the lands beneath the sea. Their scavenging parties have uncover¬ 
ed artifacts and tidbits of knowledge from a vast collection of 
underwater ruins and sunken ships. Sea elf traders remember the 
histories of other races back beyond the imaginings of the current 
generation. The trick is to gel them to reveal this information. 

Malenti 

There is a bond between aquatic elves and their hated enemies, 
the sahuagin, that neither race openly acknowledges. If sea elves 
are present within a mile or so of a sahuagin encampment, then 
approximately one out of every 1 hundred sahuagin births resem¬ 
bles an aquatic elf rather than a sea-devil, Most of the time, these 
offspring, known as malenti, are eaten by their parents. Once in 
a great while, a malenti is allowed to live to adulthood because its 
physical resemblance to an aquatic elf, in combination with its 
sahuagin upbringing and attitude, make it an ideal spy in elven 
communities. Indeed, malenti often develop the ability to sense 
the presence and position of any aquatic elves within 120 feet, an 
invaluable skill for either a spy or a scout for an invading sa¬ 
huagin force. 

Few aquatic elves believe in the existence of malenti. as they 
suggest some disturbing possibilities about sahuagin origins. 

Malenti do exist, however, and are identical to aquatic elves in 
most ways. They age much faster, though, with a life span of 
only 170 years or so. Although the sea elves themselves have a 
difficult time discerning malenti spies, dolphins might (20%) 
sense one of the changelings, malenti understandably aren't 
fond of dolphins. 

It is possible tor sahuagin and malenti to breed, the issue in¬ 
variably being malenti. In this way whole sahuagin communities 
have vanished, replaced by malenti. These extraordinarily rare 
bands resemble aquatic elves in nearly every way (except life 
span, known languages and other obvious aspects), but they are 
just as evil as their sahuagin parents. They often fight in that 
style, and they worship the same evil powers as the sahuagin.

These dreaded, evil creatures were once part of the community of 
elves that still roam the world s forests. Now these dark elves in¬ 
habit black caves and winding tunnels under the earth, where 
they make dire plans against the races that still walk beneath the 
sun, on the surface of the green earth. 

Drow have black skin and pale, usually white hair. They are 
shorter and more slender than humans, seldom reaching more 
than 5 feet in height. Male drow weigh between 80 and 110 
pounds, and females between 95 and 120 pounds. Drow have 
finely chiseled features, and their fingers and toes are long and 
delicate. Like all elves, they have higher Dexterity and lower 
Constitution than men. 

Drow clothing is usually black, functional, and often possesses 
special properties, although it does not radiate magic. For exam¬ 
ple. drow cloaks and boots act as if they are cloaks of and boots 
of ehenkmd, except that the wearer is only 75% likely to remain 
undetected in shadow's or to surprise enemies. The material used 
to make drow cloaks does not cut easily and is fire resistant, giv¬ 
ing the cloaks a+ 6 bonus to saving throws vs, fire. These cloaks 
and boots fit and function only for those of clven size and build. 
Any attempt to alter a drow cloak has a 75% chance of unravel¬ 
ing the material, making it useless. 

In the centuries they've spent underground, drow have learned 
the languages of many of the intelligent creatures of the under¬ 
world. Besides their own tongue, an exotic variant of elvish, 
drow speak both common and the subterranean trade language 
used by many races under the earth. They speak the languages of 
gnomes and other elves fluently 

Drow also have their own silent language composed of both 
signed hand movements and body language. These signs can con* 
vey information, but not subtle meaning or emotional content. If 
within 30 feet of another drow, they can also use complex facial 
expressions, body movements, and postures to convey meaning. 
Coupled with their hand signs, these expressions and gestures 
give the drows silent language a potential for expression equal to 
most spoken languages, 



Combat: The drow's world is one in which violent conflict is part 
of everyday life. It should not be surprising then, that most drow 
encountered, whether alone or in a group, are ready to fight, 
Drow encountered outside of a drow city are at least 2nd-level 
lighters. {See Society note below.) 

Drow wear finely crafted, non-encumbering, black mesh ar¬ 
mor. This extremely strong mail is made with a special alloy of 
steel containing adamantite. The special alloy when worked by a 
drow armorer, yields mail that has the same properties of chain 
mail + J to + S, although it does not radiate magic. Even the low¬ 
liest drow fighters have, in effect, chain mail +I r while higher 
level drow have more finely crafted, more powerful, mail. (The 
armor usually has a + 1 for every four levels of experience of the 
drow wearing It.) 

Dark elves also carry small shields [bucklers) fashioned of ada¬ 
mantite. Like drow armor, these special shields may be + 1, +2, 
or even+3, though only the most important drow fighters 
have+3 bucklers. 

Most drow carry a long dagger and a short sword of adamanti¬ 
te alloy. These daggers and swords can have a + 1 to + 3 bonus, 
and drow nobles may have daggers and swords of +4 bonus. 
Some drow (50%) also carry small crossbows that can be held in 
one hand and will shoot darts up to 60 yards. The darts only 
inflict 1-3 points of damage, but dark elves commonly coat them 
with poison that renders a victim unconscious, unless he rolls a 
successful saving throw- vs. poison, with a -4 penalty. The ef¬ 
fects last 2d4 hours. 

A few drow carry adamantite maces (+ 1 to + 5 bonus) instead 
of blades. Others carry small javelins coated with the same poi¬ 
son as the darts. They have a range of 90 yards with a short range 
bonus of + 3, a +2 at medium, and a +1 at long. 

Drow move silently and have superior infravision (120 feet), 
They also have the same intuitive sense about their underground 
world as dwarves do, and can detect secret doors with the same 
chance of success as other elves. A dark elf can only be surprised 
by an opponent on a roll of 1 on IdlO.

Elf, Prow 


All dark, elves receive training in magic, and are able to use the 
to I lowing spells once per day: dancing lights, faerie fire. and 
darkness. Drow above 4th level can use levitate, iotoio align¬ 
ment, and detect magic once per day. Drow priests can also use 
detect lie, clairvoyance suggestion, and dispel magic once per 
day. 

Perhaps it is the common use of magic in drow society that has 
given the dark elves their incredible resistance. Drow have a base 
resistance to magic of 50 %. which increases by 2% for each level 
of experience, (Multi-classed drow gain the bonus from only the 
class in which they have the highest level.) All dark elves save vs. 
all forms of magical attack (including devices) with a +2 bonus. 
Thus, a 5th-Jcvel drow* has a 60% base magic resistance and a +2 
bonus to her saving throws vs. spells that get past her magic re¬ 
sistance. 

Drow encountered in a group always have a leader of a higher 
level than the rest of the party. If 10 or more drow are encoun¬ 
tered, a fighter/mage of at least 3rd level in each class is leading 
them. If 20 drow are encountered, then, in addition to the higher 
level fighter/mage, there is a fighter /priest of at least the 6th level 
in both classes. If there are more than 30, up to 50% are priests 
and the leader is at least a 7th-level fighter/&amp;fch-level priest, with 
a Sth-level fighter/4th-level mage for an assistant, in addition to 
the other high level leaders. 

Dark elves do have one great weakness + bright light. Because 
the drow have lived so long in the earth, rarely venturing to the 
surface, they are no longer able to tolerate bright light of any 
kind, Drow within the radius of a light or continual light spell are 
90% likely to be seen. In addition, they lose 2 points from their 
Dexterity and attack with a -2 penalty inside the area of these 
spells. Characters subject to spells cast by drow affected by a 
fight or continual light spell add a +2 bonus to their saving 
throws. If drow are attacking a target that is in the area of effect 
of a light or continual light spell, they suffer an additional -1 
penalty to their attack rolls, and targets of drow magical attacks 
save at an additional + 1. These penalties are cumulative (i.e., if 
both the drow and their targets are in the area of effect of a hghf 
spell, the drow suffer a -3 penalty to their attack rolls and the 
targets gain a +3). 

Because of the serious negative effects of strong light on the 
drow, they are 75% likely to leave an area of bright light, unless 
they are in battle. Light sources like torches, lanterns, magical 
weapons, or fame fire spells, do not affect drow. 

Habitat society: Long ago, dark elves were part of the eiven race 
that roamed the world's forests. Not long after they were created, 
though, the elves found themselves torn into rival factions + one 
following the tenets of evil, the other owning the ideals of good 
(or at least neutrality). A great civil war between the elves fol¬ 
lowed, and the selfish elves who followed the paths of evil and 
chaos were driven into the depths of the earth, into the bleak, 
lightless caverns and deep tunnels of the underworld. These dark 
elves became the drow. 

The drow no longer wish to live upon the surface of the earth. 
In fact few who live on the surface ever see a drow. But the dark 
elves resent the elves and faeries who drove them away, and 
scheme against those that dw f ell in the sunlight. 

Drow live m magnificently dark, gloomy cities In the under¬ 
world that few humans or demihumans ever see. They construct 
their buildings entirely out of stone and minerals, carved into 
weird, fantastic shapes. Those few surface creatures that have 
seen a dark elf city (and returned to tell the tale) report that it is 
the stuff of which nightmares are made. 

Drow society is fragmented into many opposing noble houses 
and merchant families, all scrambling for power* In fact* all drow 
carry brooches inscribed with the siTnboJ of the merchant or no¬ 


ble group they are allied with, though they hide these and do not 
show them often. The drow believe that the strongest should 
rule: their rigid class system, with a long and complicated list of 
titles and prerogatives, is based on the idea. 

They worship a dark goddess, called Lolth by some, and her 
priestesses hold very high places in society* Since most drow 
priests are female, women tend to fill nearly all positions of great 
importance. 

Drow fighters go through rigorous training while they are 
young. Those who fail the required tests are killed at the pro¬ 
gram's conclusion. That is why dark elf fighters of less than 2nd 
level are rarely seen outside a drow city. 

Drow often use giant lizards as pack animals, and frequently 
take bugbears or troglodytes as servants. Drew cities are havens 
for evil beings, including mind flayers, and drow are allied with 
many of the underworld's evil inhabitants. On the other hand, 
they are constantly at war with many of their neighbors beneath 
the earth, including dwarves or dark gnomes (sviifneblin) who 
settle to dose to a drow city* Dark elves frequently keep slaves of 
all types, including past allies who have failed to live up to drow 
expectations. 

Ecology: The drow produce unusual weapons and clothing with 
quasi-magicai properties. Some scribes and researchers suggest 
that it is the strange radiation around drow cities that make drow 
crafts spedaL Others theorize that fine workmanship gives their 
wonderfully strong metals and superior cloth its unique attrib¬ 
utes. Whatever the reason, it's clear that the drow have discov¬ 
ered some way to make their clothing and weapons without the 
use of magic. 

Direct sunlight utterly destroys drow cloth, boots, weapons* 
and armor. When any item produced by them is exposed to the 
light of the sun, irreversible decay begins. Within 2d6 days, the 
items lose their magical properties and rot* becoming totally 
worthless. Drow artifacts* protected from sunlight, retain their 
special properties for ld2O+30 days before becoming normal 
items. If a drow item is protected from direct sunlight and ex¬ 
posed to the radiations of the drow underworld for one week out 
of every four* it will retain its properties indefinitely. 

Droiw sleep poison, used on their darts and javelins, is highly 
prized by traders on the surface. However, this poison loses its 
potency instantly when exposed to sunlight, and remains effec¬ 
tive for only 60 days after it is exposed to air. Drow poison re¬ 
mains potent for a year if kept in an unopened packet. 

Driders 

These strange creatures have the head and torso of a drow and 
the legs and lower body of a giant spider. Driders are created by 
the drow s dark goddess. When a dark elf of above-average abili¬ 
ty reaches 6th level, the goddess may put him or her through a 
special test, Failures become driders. 

Driders are able to cast all spelts a normal drow can use once 
per day. They also retain any magical or clerical skills they had 
before transformation, A majority of driders (60%) were priests 
of 6th or 7th level before they were changed, ail other driders 
were mages of 6th, 7th, or 8th level, 

Driders always fight as 7 Hit Die monsters, They often use 
swords or axes, though many carry bows. Driders can bite for 
ld4 points of damage* and those bitten must save vs, poison with 
a “2 penalty or be paralyzed for 1-2 turns. 

Because they have failed their goddess's test, driders are out¬ 
casts from their own communities. Driders are usually found 
alone or with 2d6 huge spiders (10% chance), rather than with 
drow or other driders. They are violent* aggressive creatures that 
favor blood over all types of food. They stalk their victims tire¬ 
lessly* waiting for the right chance to strike.

Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with 
all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are 
exceedingly cruel very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps— 
very deadly traps—much like the spiders that often live around 
them. 

Ettercaps stand around six feet tall even with their stooping 
gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly 
legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot¬ 
bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fin¬ 
gers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by 
tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. 
Ettercaps* heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large 
reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one 
protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth 
itself js large and lined with very sharp teeth. 

Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express them¬ 
selves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, 
shrieks, and violent actions. 


Combat: If caught in a battle, an ettercap first strikes with its 
claws, causing 1-3 points of damage with each set. The creature 
then tries to bite its opponent, inflicting ld8 points of damage 
with its teeth and powerful jaws. A successful bite attack by an 
ettercap enables the monster to inject its victim with a powerful 
poison from the glands above the ettercap s fangs. 

The poison secreted by an ettercap is highly toxic and very 
similar to the poison of giant spiders. A creature injected with it 
must immediately roll a saving throw vs. poison. A tailed roil 
means that the creature dies within Id4 turns when the toxigen 
paralyzes the victim's heart. 

Many adventurers never get the chance to raise a sword 
against ettercaps because of the devious traps they use for protec¬ 
tion. Ettercaps prefer to ambush unwary travelers and lead them 
into traps rather than fight them face to face. 

Like spiders, ettercaps have silk glands located in their abdo¬ 
men. The thin, strong strands of silvery silk-like materia] these 
glands secrete are used by ettercaps to construct elaborate traps 
made up of nets, trip wires, garottes, and any thing else the mon¬ 
sters can make out of the strands. The traps are designed so that 
they often immobilize the adventurer who stumbles into it. If this 
is the case, ettercaps never hesitate to attack that character first. 



trying to poison the victim before he escapes. Different ettercaps 
prefer different trap designs, so encounters with different etter¬ 
caps should expose the adventurer to new traps each time. 


Habltat/Sodety: Ettercaps prefer to dwell in the deepest part of 
a forest, near paths that are frequented by game or travelers, The 
creatures' nests are made of a frame of strands Filled with rotting 
leaves and moss. The lairs are often located on the ground, but 
can also be found up in large, sturdy trees. No treasure is to be 
found in ettercap lairs, but occasionally items dropped by adven¬ 
turers who have fallen into ettercap traps are found nearby, 
Though usually only one ettercap is encountered at any time, 
on rare occasions a pair of ettercaps can be found together. The 
pairs encountered are always mated couples, though the female 
and male appear to be identical. Ettercap young are abandoned 
as soon as they are born, so adults are never encountered with 
young. 

Ecology: An ettercap eats any meat, regardless of the type of 
creature from which it comes. Upon capturing a victim, the etter¬ 
cap poisons it so it cannot escape, once the creature is dead, the 
ettercap immediately devours as much of the corpse as possible. 
Tvpically, an ettercap can consume an entire deer or a large hu¬ 
manoid in a single sitting. Anything remaining after the ettercap 
has gorged itself is left for scavengers. 

Often (40%), 2d4 spiders of some monstrous type are found 
cooperating with an ettercap. The ettercap uses any giant spider 
webs available when it designs its traps. Creatures killed by an 
ettercap in the web of a giant spider are shared with the spider 
instead of being devoured entirely by the ettercap. 

Ettercap poison is highly valued, partly because of its extreme 
toxicity and partly because it is rather difficult to obtain. An et- 
tercaps poison glands hold only one ounce of poison at any time, 
but this ounce is worth up to 1,000 gp on the open market.

Eyewings are loathsome inhabitants of the Abyss, They are obe¬ 
dient, loyal and dumb—perfect servitors for the dark gods and 
their more powerful minions. 

An eyewings body is a tat, egg-shaped ball covered with mat¬ 
ted black fur. The Moot-wide body is supported by a pair of 
five-foot-long leathery bat wings. Each wing is tipped with a set 
of three razor-sharp talons. An Moot-long rat's tail dangles from 
the back of the body. The tail ends in a small, sharp spur, it has 
no feet and has never been known to land, 

The body is dominated by the single, bulging, 4-foot-wide eye¬ 
ball. The eyeball is black with a blood-red pupil. A vile blue fluid 
continuously leaks from the eye, soiling its fur. Great leathery 
eyelids squeeze this fluid out and away from the creature. The 
stench is unbelievable. It gives off an acidic smell that scorches 
the sensitive tissues in other creatures" noses and mouths. 

Combat: An eyewing has two main forms of attack. The most 
common form is to use its claws and tail to strike its opponents. It 
can either swoop down on them, or hover and slash. Its second 
form of attack is to bomb its enemies with a large eyewing tear 
that is squeezed out of the large eyeball by the leathery eyelid. It 
has amazing control over the release of the tear—it has the same 
chance to hit with a tear as with its melee attacks. It releases a 
tear when it is within 100 feet of its target. It can deliver this at¬ 
tack while hovering or diving. 

An eyewing tear is a one-f cot-diameter ball of poisonous blue 
fluid. The attack roll determines if the target dodged the tear. If 
the tear hits, the victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. 
poison or suffer 2d6 points of damage (success means only Ido 
points of damage). The tears may also splash onto anyone within 
ten feet of the target, The attack roll for the splash attack is made 
with a -2 penalty. If someone is splashed, a saving throw vs. poi¬ 
son must be rolled; those who fail suffer 2d4 points of damage, 
while those who succeed suffer ld4 points of damage. 

A tear hardens into a rubbery' lump within 2d6 hours after be¬ 



ing shed. The exact time depends upon the humidity tempera¬ 
ture, etc. Anybody handling a hardened tear must roil a success¬ 
ful saving throw vs. poison or suffer 1 point of damage. 

Eyewings have extremely acute vision that enables them to see 
with perfect accuracy for up to 25 miles. They also have infra- 
vision out to 120 feet. They are immune to ail cold-based attack 
forms, as are their tears. 

Habital/Sodety: Eyewings are supernatural creatures that exist 
only to serve their dark masters. When left without orders they 
become sluggish and listless* This should not be taken to mean 
that they are any less dangerous. This listlessness is their expres¬ 
sion of boredom, but nothing relieves eyewing boredom quite 
like tearing apart innocent creatures, 

Eyewings have no society as such. They do not have a culture 
Their simple language consists of shrill squeaks. They under¬ 
stand other spoken languages, but cannot speak them. When in 
the Abyss they are found only on layers that allow for flying. 
Their immunity to cold makes them at home on any of the Icy 
layers as well. 

Ecology: Eyewings are sexless creatures that are not a part of 
nature. They kill even when they're not ordered to, just for the 
pleasure of it. Eyewings have been encountered on the moon, 
where there is no air to breathe and no water to drink. It is as¬ 
sumed that they do not need air or water. They have never been 
seen to eat; it is assumed by most who have studied them that 
they are sustained by magic. The more powerful creatures of the 
Abyss have no qualms about an eyewing snack should one be 
nearby, but they are not the natural prey of any creature.

Feyrs (pronounced "fears") are created from the remnants of or¬ 
dinary nightmares, mixed with residua] magical energies, and 
unknowingly brought to life by the strong emotions of a large 
group of people. They are most commonly found in large cities 
that have a good number of mages, priests, and other spell- 
casters, Normal feyrs stalk the streets at night, seeking nothing 
more than to create havoc. Great feyrs. on the other hand, are 
the combination of lesser feyrs, and may be found anywhere, 
though they a much rarer than the common feyrs. 

Common feyrs appear as humped, hunchbacked creatures, 
grim and inhuman in appearance, Their hide is mottled and 
warped like the surface of the human brain. The creature is sup¬ 
ported by two main tentacles which act as legs, and by a handful 
of other tentacJed limbs. Massive horizontal jaws line its under¬ 
side, and the forepart of the beast has 1-5 eyes, usually the color 
of melted gold. The feyrs hide is a sickly rainbow of shades, like 
light reflected off an oil slick. There are dull blues and blacks 
along the body pale reds and magentas toward the head, and 
deathly greens and yellows along the belly. 

Combat: The horizontal jaws of the feyr slung beneath its belly 
are the creature s prime form of attack, inflicting ld4 points of 
damage for common feyrs, 2d6 points for great feyrs. The feyr 
does not use its jaws to eat, but rather to strike terror into the 
hearts of those who witness its savage and bloody attacks. Those 
who witness the attack of either type of feyr must make a success¬ 
ful saving throw vs. spells or be consumed by fear (as the spell of 
the same name', This fear acts for ld4 rounds for common feyrs, 
and 2d6 rounds for great feyrs. This form of fear only applies 
when the creature attacks, Merely sighting a common feyr does 
not inspire fear . 

The great feyr has an additional power that can affect the emo¬ 
tions similar to the 4thdevel wizard spell emotion , The range of 
this attack is 100 yards, may affect a 20-foot by 20-foot area, and 
the intended victim must make a successful saving throw vs, 
spells at _ 2 or be affected. Only the negative emotions of fear ; 
hale, hopelessness , and sadness may be cast by the great feyr. 
The great feyr may cast this spell and retain its invbibility . 

Common feyrs are slain by direct sunlight, though they have 
no fear of it themselves, and do not seek shelter with the coming 
sun , nor hesitate to venture out if they are still alive after sun-up. 



Common feyrs can use a saving throw vs, spells against sunlight 
created by magic spells, such as conffmioi tight in addition to 
their standard magic resistance. Greater fevrs are unaffected by 
sunlight. 

Habitat/Society: Individual common feyrs are slain by the morn¬ 
ing light. There are occasions when several common feyrs com¬ 
bine to form a great feyr, which in addition to being immune to 
the effects of the sun, is much more intelligent. The greater feyr 
seeks to inspire even stronger emotions, which it may then use to 
stay alive. While common feyrs do not travel far from their point 
of origin, great feyrs may undertake long trips, lured by strong 
emotional states. 

While a common feyr merely slouches through the evening 
shadows and fogs, looking for a collection of victims to terrorize 
and thereby enrich itself on their emotions, a great feyr chooses 
to attack while invisible, playing the emotions of others, height¬ 
ening emotional states already present, and driving mortal be¬ 
ings mad with terror and fear. While the great feyr Is not 
banished by daylight, it prefers to work at night, and seeks to 
retreat into a hidden lair during daylight hours, preferably some 
abandoned area such as an old house, cavern, or underground 
structure. 

Ecology: Common feyrs are created by the emotions of large 
masses of people, and great feyrs by compilations of lesser feyrs. 
The raw materials for such creatures may be found in any urban 
settlement, and when there is additional tension in the air, the 
feyrs stalk at night. Cities under siege, towns divided by rivalries 
or civil wars, oppressed peoples, and settlements baking under a 
merciless summer heat are all possible breeding grounds of feyrs. 
Guard and watch units are usually more than sufficient to handle 
the common feyrs, as those feyrs attack anything that moves. 
But the more dangerous great feyrs must be dealt with by a wiz¬ 
ard or similar high-level individual, who can both withstand the 
attack of the feyr and dispatch it*

Giant hsh are a diverse group ot creatures with varying attack and de¬ 
fense capabilities. Many of these creatures are able to swallow victims 
whole. Swallowed victims take normal bite damage. Victims take 1 poinl 
of damage per round from the fish's digestive juices and have a 5% cumu¬ 
lative chance per round of suffocating. To escape the fish's stomach, a 
victim can cut free with a sharp-edged weapon. The victim may be res¬ 
cued by cutting or tearing from the outside. When the fish has lost 50% of 
its hit points, the victim breaks free. 

Barracuda 

The first due that a barracuda is in the area might be a sudden pain in the 
foot, as the marauder swims by and bites off a few tender toes. They are 
found in warm salt waters. 

Caip. Giant 

Giant carp attack by biting, inflicting 2-20 points of damage with their 
sharp, curved teeth. Additionally, if an attack causes 12 or more points of 
damage, the carp swallows its victim. 

Catfish. Giant 

A giant catfish bites for 3d4 points of damage, ll swallows it prey if its 
attack roll is 4 points more than it needed. The fish can employ its feelers 
as weapons by whipping its head back and forth. These feelers secrete a 


toxin that causes 2d4 points of damage. A save vs. poison limits the dam¬ 
age La ld4 points. Two additional opponents can be attacked if they are 
within range of the feelers, 

Dragonfish 

Dragonfish bite for 1-6 points of damage. However, most adventurers 
stumble across these Creatures, These encounters cause ld6 of the fish's 
spines to penetrate boots, causing 1 point of damage apiece before snap¬ 
ping off In the wound. The spines' poison is slow-acting, and creatures 
injected with the toxin must make a saving throw vs. poison at a ^4 or 
dies. If successful, the character suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls 
for the next ld!2 +4 hours. 

Eel Elec Irk 

An attacking ed discharges a jolt of electricity with a 15-foot-radius 
range. Creatures less than 5 feet from the eel suffer 3d8 points of damage, 
creatures 5 to 10 feeL away receive 2dS points, and all others in range 
suffer ld8 points. An eel must recharge itself for an hour between attacks. 
It is immune to electrical effects. 

Eel Giant 

Giant eels have no electrical discharge attack. Instead, they attack with 


I 17 









Fish 


their teeth. Since they strike with amazing speed, giant eels receive a +1 
bonus to initiative rolls. 

EeJl Marine 

Marine eels have an electrical discharge with a range of 15 feet: creatures 
less than 5 feet from the eel suffer 6d6 points of damage, those 5 to 10 feet 
away receive 4d6 points, and all others in range suffer 2d6 points. Vic¬ 
tims must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzafiori or be stunned for a number 
oi rounds equal to the damage they sustained from the electrical shock. 
This eel, too, Is immune to electrical effects, 

Eel Weed 

The bite of the weed eel Es poisonous; victims failing a saving throw' vs. 
poison die in ld4 rounds. 

Weed eels are at home in both fresh and salt water, 25 to 40 feet deep. 
Each colony has a Eair consisting oi a central cave, roughly 30 feel long 
and 20 ieei wide and high. The floor of the central cave Is covered with 
small stones, coins, and gems that the eels have scavenged. Radiating 
from this central cave are a series of 6-foot-diameter tunnels, which in 
turn lead to a neEurork of 6 to S-inch-dia meter holes. These are the homes 
of the individual eeb that make up the colony. Weed ceLs are fiercely pro¬ 
tective of their lairs, especially the central cave where their young are 
raised. 

Gar, Giant 

The gar attacks with its teeth, inflicting 8d4 points of damage. On a score 
of 20, the gar swallows its victim whole, On average, a giant gar can 
swallow an object up to 5 feet long. Giant gars are found in deep, fresh¬ 
water lakes and rivers. 

Lamprey 

The lamprey feeds by biting its victims, and fastening itself by its 
sphincter-1 ike mouth. Once attached, the lamprey drains 2 hit points per 
Hit Die of blood on she next and successive rounds. Sea lampreys are 
especially susceptible to fire, making their saving throws against fire- 
based attacks with a “2 penalty, 

Lamprey, Land 

Land lampreys feed as do aquatic ones, Once attached (a hit for 1 point of 
damage 1, it drains blood tor three rounds, unless killed nr removed, for 1 
point of damage per round. In addition, while attached to a character, 
each lamprey encumbers an individual- this is equivalent to a loss of 1 
point of Dexterity per lamprey attached. 

Manta Ray 

If the manta's attack roll is 2 or more greater I ban the number needed to 
hit. it swallows its prey, A manta ray can swallow one man-sized creature 
or three small-sized creatures. If opponents attack its rear, it uses its sting¬ 
er for 2-20 points of damage? victims must save vs. paralyzation or be 
stunned for 2-3 rounds. 

Pike, Giant 

Because of Its speed and natural camouflage, a pikes opponents suffer a 
-2 penalty to their surprise roll. Giant pike inhabit deep, freshwater 
lakes. 

Piranha 

Piranhas travel in schools of 5-50. There is a 75% chance that at least one 
will attack any creature that swims or wades near the school. If they at¬ 
tack and blood is drawn, the entire school goes berserk and each piranha 
attacks twice per melee round Up to 20 piranhas can attack a single, 
man-sized individual simultaneously. 

Piranha, Giant 

Giant piranhas behave like Lheir smaller counterparts, but only 10 can 
attack a single, man-sized individual simultaneously. 

Giant piranhas are sometimes called sky-eaters; once per round they can 
charge at full speed and leap out of the water at heights of up to 10 feetr 
they often use this attack on water fowl that fly low over the water, but 
they* sometimes use it against humans. 



Fungi Ray 

Any creature stepping on a pungi must save vs. poison or die. A footstep 
on a pungi ray equals one attack; if a creature fell on a pungi ray it would 
suffer 2-S spinal attacks. If attacked, it swims away. 

Quip per 

Quippers are freshwater piranhas that live in colder waters. 

Seahorse, Giant 

A sea horse attacks with a head butt, but a sea horse Lrained as a steed can 
use its long tail to constrict and restrain enemies. A captured opponent 
can free itself with a open doors roll made with a — 1 penalty. The tail of a 
giant sea horse is so tong It can attack the same opponent its head butts, 
or the one its rider is attacking. The constriction causes no damage, bul 
the sea horse tan still butt the helpless victim. 

Shark 

Sharks attack mercilessly at the scent of blood, which they can detect a 
mile away. The scent of blood and the thrill of the kill sends sharks into a 
feeding frenzy. Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat, 10 
normal-sized sharks can attack a man-sized opponent. 

Shark, Giant 

The huge megalodons (giant sharks) never reach a frenzy, since they can 
swallow most creatures whole on an attack roll 4 greater than minimum 
number needed to hit. 

Sting Ray 

If a creature steps on a sting ray. It lashes out with its tail spine. The crea¬ 
ture must save vs. poison or be paralyzed for 5-20 turns.

Giant Frogs: Giant frogs resemble their more common relatives 
in everything but size. Their enormous size means that they con¬ 
sider larger creatures as a source of food, making small creatures 
and even demihumans possible prey, A giant frog can range from 
2 to 6 feet in length and weigh between 50 and 250 pounds (a 2- 
foot frog weighs 50 pounds, adding 50 pounds for each addition* 
al foot of length) . Frogs with 1 Hit Die are 2 feet long, while those 
2 to 4 feet long have 2 Hit Dice, and those over 4 feet long have 3 
Hit Dice. 

The distance that a giant frog can jump is based upon its 
weight, with the maximum jumping distance for a 50-pound frog 
being 180 feet. Subtract 20 feet for every additional 50 pounds 
the frog weighs. A giant frog cannot jump backward or directly 
to either side, but can leap 30 feet straight up. 

Combat: Because of its camouflaging color, a giant frog surprises 
opponents easily (-3 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls) when in 
its natural habitat. A giant frog uses its long, sticky tongue to 
entrap its victim. The tongue is equal in length to three times the 
frog's length and strikes with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. The 
tongue inflicts no damage when it hits. 

Once a victim is caught by the frog s tongue, it has one chance 
to hit the tongue before the frog attempts to reel it in. If the 
tongue is hit the frog releases the victim and does not attack that 
creature again. Otherwise, the victim is reeled in. 

If the victim weighs less than the frog, it is dragged into the 
frog's mouth in the same round it attacked and missed striking 
the tongue. If the creature weighs more than the frog, an extra 
round is required tor the frog to draw the creature in. This grants 
the victim another opportunity to hit the tongue. Any creature 
weighing more than twice the frog's weight cannot be pulled by 
the frog and is released on the third round alter it was caught, 
even if the tongue is never struck. 

Once the victim has been drawn to the frog's mouth, the frog 
attempts to eat it* If the giant frog successfully bites its victim in 
the first round the creature is in range, it automatically scores 
maximum damage. Frogs with 1 Hit Die bite for 1-3 points of 
damage, those with 2 Hit Dice 1-6 points, and those with 3 Hit 
Dice inflict 2-8 points of biting damage. 


On an attack roll result of 20, the frog can swallow whole any 
creature shorter than 3 feet Jong, Any creature swallowed whole 
has a chance to cut its way out of the frog with a sharp-edged 
weapon, but must roll an attack roll result of 18 or better. A vic¬ 
tim has only three rounds to escape before asphyxiating. A suc¬ 
cessful escape kills the frog* Any damage inflicted upon a frog 
that has swallowed a creature whole has a 33% chance of also 
being inflicted on the swallowed victim. 

Giant frogs fear fire and always retreat from it. 

Habitat/Societys Giant frogs live in groups but don t have any 
real social structure. They are aggressive hunters and eat insects, 
fish, and small mammals. Large aquatic predators such as giant 
fish and giant turtles often prey upon them. 

Killer Frogs: This smaller version of the giant frog attacks with 
sharp teeth and front talons. While it does not swallow victims 
whole, the killer frog is a vicious hunter and is especially fond of 
the taste of human flesh. 

Poisonous Frogs: A rare type of normal frog, this breed secretes 
a contact poison from Us skin, as well as with its bite. The weak¬ 
ness of the poison gives all victims a +4 bonus to their saving 
throws. Due to its weakness and the difficulty of collecting it, 
there is no market for this poison.

Fungi are simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true stems, roots, 
and leaves. Fungi are incapable of photosynthesis and live as par¬ 
asites or saprophytes. 

Ordinary Fungi 

Ordinary fungi are well known to man- molds, yeast, mildew, 
mushrooms, and puffballs. These plants include both useful and 
harmful varieties. 

Combat: Ordinary fungi do not attack or defend themselves, 
but they are prolific and can spread where unwanted. 

Adventurers who have lost rations to mold or clothing to mil¬ 
dew have had unpleasant encounters with fungi. 

Habitat/Soriety: The bodies of most true fungi consist of slen* 
der cottony filaments. Anyone who wishes to see this for himself 
need only leave a damp piece of bread in a cupboard for a day or 
two. Examining the black mold on the bread with a magnifying 
glass will show off not only the filaments, but also the spore 
bodies at the top of these. The spores are what gives mold its 
color. 

Most fungi reproduce asexually by cell division, budding, 
fragmentation, or spores. Those that reproduce sexually alter¬ 
nate a sexual generation (gam etop byte) with a spore-produdng 
(sporophyte) one. 

Fungi grow best in dark, damp environments, which they can 
find all too easily in a kitchen cupboard, backpack, or boot. A 
warm environment is preferred by some, such as yeasts and cer¬ 
tain molds, but excessive heat kills fungi. 

Proper storage and cleanliness can be used to avoid most ordi¬ 
nary fungi. 

Ecology: Fungi break down organic matter, thus playing an im¬ 
portant part in the nitrogen cycle by decomposing dead organ¬ 
isms into ammonia. Without the action of mushrooms and 
bracket fungi, soil renewal could not take place as readily as it 
does. 

Fungi are also useful to man for many purposes. Yeasts are 
valuable as fermenting agents, raising bread and brewing wines, 
beers, and ales. Certain molds are important for cheese produc¬ 
tion. The color in blue cheese is a mold that has been encouraged 
to grow in this semisoft cheese. 


Many fungi are edible, and connoisseurs consider some to be 
delicious. Pigs are used to hunt for truffles, an underground fun¬ 
gus that grows near tree roots and gives food a piquant flavor. 
No one has as yet managed to cultivate truffles—an enterprising 
botanist could make a mint by learning to grow these. 

Mushrooms, the fruiting body of another underground fun¬ 
gus, can sometimes be eaten, but can be so poisonous that the 
novice mushroom hunter is allowed but one mistake in picking. 
The mycelium producing a single mushroom might extend be¬ 
neath the ground for several feet in any direction. 

Medicinally, green molds (such as penirillium) can be used as 
folk remedies for various bacterial infections.

Fungus 


An alchemist expert in the ways of fungi can produces variety 
of useful substances from their action on various materials, 

Violet Fungus 

Violet fungus growths resemble shriekers, and are usually (75%) 
encountered with them. The latter are immune to the touch of 
violet fungi, and the two types of creatures complement each 
others existence. 

Combat: Violet fungi favor rotted animal matter to grow upon. 
Each fungus has one to four branches with which it Flails out if 
any animal comes within range (see following). The excretion 
from these branches rots flesh in one round unless a successful 
saving throw vs. poison is rolled or a cure disease spell is used. 
The branch length of this fungi depends upon the fungi's size, Vi¬ 
olet fungi range from four to seven feet talk the smallest having 
one-foot-long branches, the five-foot-tall fungi having two-foot- 
long branches, and so on. Any sized growth can have up to four 
branches. 

Shrieker 

Shriekers are normally quiet, mindless fungi that are ambulatory. 
They are dangerous to dungeon explorers because of the hellish 
racket they make. 

Combat: Light within 30 feet or movement within 10 feet 
causes a shrieker to emit a piercing shriek that lasts for 1-3 
rounds. This noise has a 50% chance of attracting wandering 
monsters each round thereafter. 

Habitat Society; They live in dark places beneath the ground, 
often in the company of violet fungi. When the shriekers attract 
curious dungeon dwellers by their shrieking, the violet fungi are 
able to kill them with their branches, leaving plenty of organic 
matter for these saprophytic life forms to feed on. 

Ecology: Purple worms and shambling mounds greatly prize 
shriekers as food, and don t seem to mind the noise while eating, 
Shrieker spores are an important ingredient in potions of plant 
control* 

Phycomid 

The algae-like phycomids resemble fibrous blobs of decompos¬ 
ing. milk-colored matter with capped fungi growing out of them. 
They exude a highly alkaline substance (like lye) when attacking. 

Combat: These fungoid monsters have sensory organs for heat, 
sound, and vibrations located in several dusters. When phy- 
comids attack, they extrude a tube and discharge the alkaline flu¬ 
id in small globules that have a range of Id6 + P feet. 

In addition to alkaline damage, the globs that these creatures 
discharge might also cause victims to serve as hosts for new phy¬ 
comid growth. If a victim fails a saving throw vs. poison, the 
individual begins to sprout mushroom-like growths in the infect¬ 
ed area. This occurs in ld4 + 4 rounds and inflicts ld4 + 4 points 


of damage. The growths then spread throughout the host body, 
killing it in ld4 +4 turns, and turning it into a new phycomid. A 
cure disease spell will stop the spread through the host. 

Ascomoid 

Ascomolds are huge, puffball-like fungi with very thick, leathery 
skin. They move by rolling. 

Combat: At first, an asco mold's movement is slow—3 for the 
first round, 6 the next, then 9, then finally 12—but they can keep 
it tip for hours without tiring. 

Ascomoids attack by rolling into or over opponents. Small- 
and medium-sized opponents are knocked down and must rise 
during the next round or remain prone, 

The creature’s surface is covered with numerous pocks which 
serve as sensory organs. Each pock can also emit a jet of spores to 
attack dangerous enemies. Large opponents or those who have 
Inflicted damage upon the ascomoids are always attacked by 
spore jets* The stream of spores is about one foot in diameter and 
30 feet long* Upon striking, the stream puffs into a cloud of varia¬ 
ble diameter (five to 20 feet). The creatures under attack must 
roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die from infection in 
their internal systems in ld4 rounds. Even those who save are 
blinded and choked to such an extent that they require ld4 
rounds to recover and rejoin melee. Meanwhile, they are nearly 
helpless, and all attacks upon them gain a +4 bonus to attack 
rolls with no shield or Dexterity bonuses allowed. 

Different types of weapons affect the ascomoid differently. 
Piercing weapons, such as spears, score double damage. Shorter 
stabbing weapons do damage as if against a small-sized oppo¬ 
nent, Blunt weapons do not harm ascomoids: slashes and cuts 
from edged weapons cause only 1 point of damage. An ascomoid 
saves against magical attacks, such a*s magic missiles, fireballs, 
and lightning, with a +4 bonus to the saving throw; damage is 
only 50% of normal. (Cold-based attacks are at normal probabil¬ 
ities and damaged As these fungi have no minds by ordinary 
standards, all spells affecting the brain (charm. ESP, etc. ), unless 
specific to plants, are useless, 

Gas Spore 

At any distance greater than 10 feet, a gas spore is 90% likely to 
be mistaken for a beholder. Even at close ranges there is a 25% 
possibility that the creature is seen as a beholder, for a gas spore 
has a false central eye and rhizome growths atop it that strongly 
resemble the eye stalks of a beholder. 

Combat: If the spore is struck for even 1 point oi damage it ex¬ 
plodes. Every creature within a 20-foot radius suffers 6d6 points 
of damage (3d6 if a saving throw vs. wands is successful). 

If a gas spore makes contact with exposed flesh, the spore 
shoots tiny rhizomes into the living matter and grows through 
the victim's system within one round. The gas spore dies immedi¬ 
ately. The victim must have a cure disease spell cast on him with¬ 
in 24 hours or die, sprouting 2d4 gas spores*

The galeb duhr is a curious boulder-like creature with append¬ 
ages that art as hands and feet. These intelligent beings are very 
large and slow-moving. They live in rocky or mountainous areas 
w here they can feel the earth power and control the rocks around 
them. 

A typical galeb duhr is from 8 to 12 feet tall. When not moving 
it looks like part of the terrain it lives in. 

Combat: Caleb duhr are fairly solitary creatures, preferring to 
live with a few of their own kind, and none of any other kind, 
including earth elemental. When approached, a galeb duhr is li¬ 
able to avoid the encounter by disappearing into the ground. If 
chased or otherwise irritated, however, a galeb duhr does not 
hesitate to fight the intruder. 

Caleb duhr can cast the following spells as ZOth-level mages, 
once per day: move earth, stone shape, passwall transmute 
rock to mud, and wall of stone. They can cast stone shape at will 

They can animate 1-2 boulders within 60 yards of them (AC 0; 
MV 3; HD 9; Dam 4d6) as a treant controls trees. Galeb duhr 
suffer double damage from cold-based attacks and save with a -4 
penalty against these attacks. They are not harmed by lightning 
or normal fire, but suffer full damage from magical fire (though 
they save with a +4 bonus against fire attacks), 

Habit a ^Society: Galeb duhr, thought to be native to the ele¬ 
mental plane of Earth, are sometimes encountered in small family 
groups in mountainous regions of the Prime Material plane. 

It is not known how (or whether) galeb duhr reproduce, but 
"young" galeb duhr have occasionally been reported—those 
specimens encountered being a smaller size than normal. 

While galeb duhr seem to have no visible culture above 
ground , they are known to collect gems, which they find through 
their passwall ability They sometimes have small magical items 
in their possession, evidently taken from those who attacked 
them to take their gems. 



The "music" of the galeb duhr often provides the first evidence 
that these creatures are near—and usually the only evidence, as 
the unsociable galeb duhr are quick to pass into the ground when 
they feel the vibrations of approaching visitors. 

Sitting together in groups, the galeb duhr harmonize their 
gravelly voices into eldritch tunes; some sages speculate that 
these melodies can cause or prevent earthquakes. Others argue 
that the low rumbling produced by these creatures is a form of 
warning to others in the group, but there is no conclusive evi¬ 
dence either way 

Ecology: Galeb duhr have no natural enemies, other than those 
who crave the gems they collect- Caleb duhr eat rock, preferring 
granite to other types, and disdaining any sedimentary type. The 
rocks they eat become part of the huge creatures; such a meal 
need take place only once every two or three months. 

Besides the gems that they carry with them, galeb duhr are 
likely to know where many other gems are, as well as veins of 
precious metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, though galeb 
duhr seem to have no interest in these minerals for themselves. A 
few powerful mages have been able to bargain with the galeb 
duhr for this information. This is a difficult agreement to con¬ 
summate, for the galeb duhr are valiant fighters, and usually 
have no difficulty in escaping from any harm if they are inclined 
to do so. Further, the galeb duhr are territorial, and would be 
irritated at any attempt to make use of this knowledge in their 
vicinity 

in some strange way, galeb duhr feel responsible for the 
smaller rocks and boulders around them, in much the same way 
that a treant feels responsible for trees in its neighborhood. A 
traveler who disturbs the area near a galeb duhr does so at his 
own peril.

Gargantua are truly monstrous species, both in size and ferocity. 
Whether they are throwbacks to another age, aberrations of natural 
processes, or results of crazed magical experiments is unknown. 

Gargantua appear in many different forms., but most resemble gi- 
gantic humanoids, insects, and reptiles. Of these three types, the 
most common is also the largest and most dangerous: the reptilian 
gargantua. 

The reptilian gargantua is so immense that it dwarfs virtually all of the 
worlds creatures. Some reptilian gargantua move on all fours. Most, 
however, are bipedal, supported by two massive legs rivaling the width 
of the largest tree trunks. The creature's body is thick and bulky Rocky 
scales—usually dark green with black accents—cover it from head to 
toe. Its smooth belly is a lighter shade of green. Certain rare types have 
mottled scales in shades of brown, gray and yellow. 

Its hands are almost human, though each of its four, long fingers ends 
in a hooked daw. Its feet are flat and broad, with webbed toes. The toe* 
also end in hooked daws, but they're shorter and thicker than those on 
its fingers, A bony ridge stretches from the base of Its neck, down along 
its spine, and extending the length of its immense tail. 

The head of the reptilian gargantua is somewhat small in propor¬ 
tion to its body. It has two glaring eyes, usually gold or bright red. Its 
nostrils are flush with its head, and its ears are twin triangular projec¬ 
tions resembling tiny wings, Its mouth is a wide slash that nearly bi¬ 
sects its entire head and is lined with rows of long fangs. 

The reptilian gargantua cannot speak, but H emits deafening roars 
that sound like the trumpeting of a bull elephant amplified a thou¬ 
sandfold. It can breathe both air and water. 

Combat; Although it has some degree of intelligence, the actions of 
the reptilian gargantua—along with the actions of most gargantua— 
are those of mindless brutes bent on destruction for destruction^ sa¬ 
ke. It attacks with sweeping rakes of its front claws and lunging bites 
from its powerful jaws. If moving upright, it can trample victims for 
ID-100 llOdlO) hit points of damage. It continually sweeps the 
ground it with its massive tail, swinging 90 feet behind it and to each 
side. Any creature within range of the tail must make a successful 
saving throw vs. death or suffer 5-80 (SdtO) hit points of damage. 

A rampaging reptilian gargantua is all but oblivious to its surround¬ 
ings, crushing everything—and everyone—in its path. The ground trem¬ 
bles under its weight when it walks. Since quaking earth always 
foreshadows its appearance, it never cm surprise its prey. When swim¬ 
ming, a reptilian gargantua is similarly handicapped, as its appearance is 
always preceded by swirling waters or crashing waves. Additionally its 


immense size makes it easy to spot from a distance. Furthermore, the 
squealing roars that accompany its every action make it virtually impos¬ 
sible to ignore, 

The reptilian gargantuan tough hide gives it an Armor Class of 2, 
forming a strong defense against most physical attacks. When it does 
suffer damage, the creature can regenerate 4 hit points per round. 

Fortunately, reptilian gargantua seldom bother humans. But their 
memories are long, and their appetite for revenge is nearly limitless. 
Humans who attack reptilian gargantua, disturb their lairs, or other¬ 
wise provoke the creatures will find themselves relentlessly 
pursued—even it means the gargantua must cross thousands of miles 
of ocean. This creatures hunger for revenge is seldom satisfied until it 
has thoroughly ravaged its attackers' villages. Sometimes, entire 
provinces will be laid to ruin. 

The surest way to provoke the wrath of a reptilian gargantua is to 
threaten its offspring. Adult gargantua have remarkable mental 
bonds with thek young, enabling them to locate their young with 
pinpoint accuracy at an unlimited range. 

In spite of thek reputation as mindless destroyers, reptilian gargan- 
lua actually possess a simple empathy that enables them to sense the 
emotions and desires of others, albeit on a primitive level. They seem 
to instinctively know which creatures bear them ill will, and direct 
their attacks accordingly. 

HabitabSociety; A few reptilian guargantua make their home on the 
floors of subtropical oceans. Most, however, live on remote tropical 
islands, far from civilized lands. Such islands are scattered through¬ 
out the oceans of Kara-Tur, with most of them uncharted, The most 
notable exception is the Isle of Gargantua* one of the Outer Isles off 
the southwestern tip of Wa. This island is Inhabited entirely by 
gargantua of various types. 

Explorers in the arctic regions of Kara-Tur once found a maturing 
reptilian gargantua frozen in a block of ice. The explorers built a mas¬ 
sive sled to haul their discovery back to civilization. The ice began to 
thaw en route, reviving the creature, The gargantua shattered the melt¬ 
ing ice block, crushed his captors, and lumbered into ihe mountains. 

Any grotto or cave that provides shelter, privacy, and sufficient 
room to house a reptilian gargantua cart serve as its lair. Fiercely ter¬ 
ritorial, a reptilian gargantua and its family usually claim an area of 
several square miles as their personal property, defending it against 
any and all intruders. Since their eyes are sensitive to bright light, the 
creatures spend most of the day sleeping in their lairs, becoming 
active at night to search for food and patrol their territory". Their 


123 










Gargantua 


thunderous roars make their presence known to all. Reptilian 
gargantua do not collect treasure or any other items. 

Reptilian gargantua live several hundred years. They choose mates 
within a few years of reaching maturity, and remain with them for 
the rest of their lives. A female reptilian gargantua gives birth to a 
single offspring once per century, The birth of a reptilian gargantua is 
marked hv shattering thunderstorms that rock the skies over the ter¬ 
ritory of its parents for 101 days. 

An immature reptilian gargantua stands about 20-40 feet tall. It 
also has 10 HD &lt;THAC0 11) and a movement rate oi 12 (Sw 9) A 
younglings daws inflict 1-10 hit points of damage each, and its bite 
inflicts 2-24 (2dl2.) hit points of damage, Its tail—not nearly as formi¬ 
dable as an adult's—sweeps the ground in an arch reaching 20 feet 
behind and to both sides, inflicting MS (3d6) points of damage to all 
victims who fail their save vs, death. 

Ecology; The reptilian gargantua is an omnivore, it primarily eats 
plants, swallowing whole trees in a single gulp. But it also enjoys liv¬ 
ing prey of all varieties. It can even dine on minerals, gems, and other 
inorganic substances in times of scarce vegetation and game. 

Reptilian gargantua shun the company of other creatures. They es¬ 
pecially dislike other types of gargantua. which sometimes compete 
*vith their reptilian cousins for the same territory. 

Reptilian gargantua have two properties useful to humans; 

• in the 

gargantua can serve as a component for a ffttfrou of growth , Such a 
flower must grow' naturally in the footprint; it cannot have been planted 
there by a human or other intelligent being, 

• As noted above, thunderstorms occur when a reptilian gargan¬ 
tua is bom . If a dead creature of any kind is struck by a lightning bolt 
from such a storm, the bolt acts as resurrection spell. 

Humanoid Gargantua 

Humanoid gargantua are the least intelligent type. They resemble gi¬ 
gantic humans,. somewhat anthropoid facially, with stooped shoul¬ 
ders, long arms, and jutting jaws, Long, greasy hair dangles about 
their shoulders, though a few humanoid gargantua are completely 
bald. They stand 80 to 100 ieet tall and are sometimes covered with 
black, brown, or golden fur, Their skin color ranges from pale pink 
to dull yellow to deep black, They have blunt noses, huge ears, and 
bright eyes, which are usually brown or red. Single-eyed humanoid 
gargantua also are rumored to exist. 

Humanoid gargantua have no language of their own, but because 
of their strong empathy with humans, they are able to comprehend 
short phrases of human languages 25% of the time. The movements 
and other actions of humanoid gargantua are typically accompanied 
by thunderous bellowing and grunting. 

The creature attacks with its two fists for 4-40 (3dl0) hit points of 
damage each. It seldom uses weapons or tools, since its blunt fingers 
manipulate these objects with difficulty. However, reports exist of 
humanoid gargantua wielding trees like clubs. The creatures also can 
make trampling attacks on anyone tor anything) who comes under¬ 
foot, causing 10-100 &lt; lOdlO) points of damage. Humanoid gargantua 
regenerate hit points at the rate of 4 per round. 

Like reptilian gargantua, humanoid gaigantua possess a simple empa¬ 
thy that enables them to sense the basic emotions and desires of others. 
Unless hungry they tend to avoid creatures who intend them no harm, 
while actively seeking out and pursuing those with hostile intentions. 

Humanoid gargantua live in valleys, in suitably sized caves in re¬ 
mote. jagged mountains, or on their own islands, far from civilized 
regions. They collect no treasure, spending most of their time eating 
and sleeping, 

They live for several centuries, and mate for life. Once every hun¬ 
dred years or so. a female humanoid gargantua gives birth to 1-2 off¬ 
spring. An immature humanoid gargantua is about 20-30 feet tall. It 
has 8 HD (THACO 13) and a movement rate of 15. Its fists inflict 1-10 
points of damage each, It cannot make trampling attacks. 

These monsters peacefully coexist w ith other creatures in their en¬ 
vironment. but humanoid gargantua compete fiercely with rival 
gargantua, and violent conflicts often result. Many such conflicts 



continue until one of the gargantua is dead. 

Humanoid gargantua eat all types of game and vegetation, prefer¬ 
ring deer, bears, horses, and similar game, 

Insectoid Gargantua 

Adult insectoid gargantua resemble immense moths. Their bodies are 
covered w + jlh fine fur, usually gray or black, and their wings bear 
colorful patterns in brilliant blue, red, yellow, and green, Their 
movements and other actions are accompanied by a piercing screech 
that sounds like a warning siren. 

The insectoid gargantua begins life as a gigantic egg, which hatches 
to reveal a gigantic larva. This larval form has 20 HD, As a larva, the 
insectoid gargantua can shoot a strand of cocoon silk to a range of 60 
feet. This silk is exceptionally strong and sticky, adhering to what¬ 
ever it hits. With this silken strand, the larva can entangle and immo¬ 
bilize victims. A strand can be severed in three ways: with 20 points 
ot damage from an edged weapon, a successful J 'bend bars/lift gates" 
roll, or by monsters of 10 HD or more. 

The larval insectoid gargantua grows at a phenomenal rate&gt; in¬ 
creasing 1 HD per week, Upon attaining 25 HD, the larva spins a 
cocoon and enters the pupal stage. It remains a pupa for 2-6 (2d4) 
weeks, finally emerging as an immense moth with 30 HD. In this 
form, the creature can no longer spin silk. However, by flapping its 
wings, it can create a huge windstorm, 60 feet wide and extending 
240 feet ahead. To remain safe, everyone and everything within the 
path of the storm must be solidly anchored (e.g., tied to a boulder). 
Unanchored victims must make a saving throw vs. death with a -4 
penalty. Those who fail their saving throw are blown back 10 to 40 
feet, suffering ld6 hit points of damage for every 10 feet blown. 

Insectoid gargantua establish lairs in the valleys and caverns of 
w p arm, mountainous regions. They live f or several hundred years. Fe¬ 
males lay a single egg every' decade, but there is only a 20% chance 
that any given egg is fertile. 

These mothlike creatures eat all types of game and vegetation. 
They prefer mulberry trees, and in just a few hours, a hungry insec¬ 
toid gargantua can consume an entire grove of them. 

The silk of insectoid gargantua larvae can be woven Into doth 
from which magical robes are created.

These monsters are ferocious predators of a magical nature, typi¬ 
cally found amid ruins or dwelling in underground caverns. They 
have their own guttural language. 

Combat: Gargoyles attack anything they detect, regardless of 
whether it is good or evil, 90% of the time. They love best to 
torture prey to death when it is helpless. 

These winged creatures are excellent fighters with four attacks 
per round. Their claw/daw/bite/hom combination can inflict 
up to 16 points of damage, while their naturally tough hide pro¬ 
tects them from victim's attacks. 

Gargoyles favor two types of attack: surprise and swooping. 
Counting on their appearance as sculptures of some sort, gar¬ 
goyles sit motionless around the rooftop of a building, waiting 
for prey to approach. Alternatively, a gargoyle may pose in a 
fountain, or a pair of the horrid beasts sit on either side of a door¬ 
way. When the victim is close enough, the gargoyles suddenly 
strike out, attempting only to injure the victim rather than to kill 
it all at once. (To a gargoyle, inflicting a s3ow\ painful death is 
best.) 

When on the move, gargoyles sometimes use a "swoop" at¬ 
tack, dropping down suddenly from the sky to make their at¬ 
tacks in an aerial ambush. In this case, they can make either two 
claw attacks or one hom attack. To make all four of their attacks, 
they must land, 

HabitatSodety: Gargoyles live in small groups with others of 
their kind, interested in little more than finding other creatures to 
hurt. Smaller animals are scarcely worth the trouble to these hid¬ 
eous monsters, who prefer to attack humans or other intelligent 
creatures. 

Gargoyles often collect treasure from human victims. Individ¬ 
uals usually have a handful of gold pieces among them, with the 
bulk of their treasure hidden carefully at their lair, usually buried 
or under a large stone, 

Ecology: Originally, gargoyles were carved roof spouts, repre¬ 
senting grotesque human and animal figures. They were designed 
in such a way that water flowing down gutters would be thrown 



away from the wall, so as to prevent stains and erosion. Later, 
some unknown mage used a powerful enchantment to bring these 
horrid sculptures to life* The race of gargoyles has flourished, 
spreading throughout the world. 

Gargoyles do not need to eat or drink, so they can stand mo¬ 
tionless for as long as they wish almost anywhere. The damage 
they do to other creatures is not for sustenance, but only for their 
distorted sense of pleasure. 

Because they are fairly intelligent and evil, they will sometimes 
serve an evil master of some sort, In this case, the gargoyles usu¬ 
ally act as guards or messengers: besides some gold or a few 
gems, their unsavory payment is the enjoyment they get from 
attacking unwanted visitors. 

The horn of the gargoyle is the more common active ingredient 
for a potion of invulnerability and can also be used in a potion of 
flying. 

Kapoacinth 

This creature is a marine variety of gargoyle that uses its wings to 
swim as fast as the land-dwelling gargoyle flies, Kapoacinth con¬ 
form in all respects to a normal gargoyle. They dwell in relatively 
shallow waters, lairing in undersea caves. 

Like gargoyles, kapoacinth are eager to cause pain to others, 
and mermen, sea elves, and human visitors are all equally quali¬ 
fied candidates for this. 

Margoyle 

Margoyles are a more horrid form of gargoyle. They are found 
mainly in caves and caverns. Their skin is so like stone that they 
are only 20% likely to be seen when against it. They attack with 
two claws, a pair of horns, and a bite. They speak their own lan¬ 
guage and that of gargoyles. They are 20% likely to be found 
with the latter, either as leaders or masters,

Genies come from the elemental planes- There- among their own 
kind, they are have their own societies. Genies are sometimes en¬ 
countered on the Prime Material plane and are often summoned 
specifically to perform some service for a powerful wizard or 
priest. All genies can travel to any of the elemental planes, as well 
as the Prime Materia! and Astral planes, Genies speak their own 
tongue and that of any intelligent beings they meet through a lim¬ 
ited form of telepathy, 

Djinni 

The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air. It should be 
noted that djinn'' is the plural form of their name, while ' djinni ' 
is the singular. 

Combat: The djinn's magical nature enables them to do any of 
the following once per day; create nufnhous food for 2d6 per¬ 
sons and create water or create wine for 2d6 persons* create 50 ft 
goods (up to 16 cubic feet) or create wooden items (up to 9 cubic 
feet) of a permanent nature; create metal, up to 100 pounds 
weight with a short life span (the harder the metal the less time it 
lasts; gold has about a 24 hour existence while djinni steel lasts 
only one hour); create illusion as a 20th-level wizard with both 
visible and audible components, which last without concentra¬ 
tion until touched or magically dispelled; use invisibility, gaseous 
form, or wind walk. 

Once per day the genie can create a whirlwind, which the it 
can ride or even direct at will from a distance. The whirlwind is a 
cone-shaped spiral, measuring up to 10 feet across at its base, 40 
feet across at the top. and up to 70 feet in height (the djinni 
chooses the dimensions). Its maximum speed is 18, with maneu¬ 
verability class A, The whirlwind's base must touch water or a 
solid surface, or it will dissolve. It takes a full turn for the whirl¬ 
wind to form or dissolve. During that time, the whirlwind inflicts 
no damage and has no other effect. The whirlwind lasts as long as 
the djinni concentrates on It, moving at the creature's whim, 

If the whirlwind strikes a non-aerial creature with fewer than 2 
Hit Dice, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath 


weapon for each round of contact with the whirlwind, or be 
swept off its feet, battered, and killed. Hardier beings, as well as 
aerial or airborne creatures, take 2d6 points of damage per round 
of contact with the whirlwind. 

A djinni can ride its whirlwind and even take along passengers, 
who (like the djinni) suffer no damage from the buffeting winds. 
The whirlwind can carry the genie and up to six man-sized or 
three genie-sized companions. 

Airborne creatures or attacks receive a -1 penalty to attack 
and damage rolls against a djinni, who also receives a +4 bonus 
to saving throws against gas attacks and air-based spells. 

Djinn are nearly impossible to capture bv physical means; a 
djinni who is overmatched in combat usually takes to flight and 
uses its whirlwind to buffet those who follow-. Genies are openly 
contemptuous of those life forms that need wings or artificial 
means to fly and use illusion and invisibility against such ene¬ 
mies. Thus, the capture and enslavement of djinn is better re¬ 
solved by the DM on a case-by-case basis. It is worth noting, 
however, that a good master will typically encourage a djinni to 
additional effort and higher performance, while a demanding 
and cruel master encourages the opposite, 

Djinn are able to carry up to 600 pounds, on foot or flying, 
without tiring. They can carry double that for a short time: three 
turns if on foot, or one turn if flying. For each 100 pounds below 
the maximum, add one turn to the time a djinni may walk or fly 
before tiring. A fatigued djinni must rest for an hour before per¬ 
forming any additional strenuous activity. 

Habitat Society; The djinn s native land is the elemental plane of 
Air, where they live on floating islands of earth and rock, any¬ 
where from 1,000 yards to several miles across. They are 
crammed with buildings, courtyards, gardens, fountains, and 
sculptures made of elemental flames. In a typical djinn landhold 
there are 3dl0 djinn of various ages and powers, as wdl as IdIG 
jann and IdlO elemental creatures of low intelligence- All are 
ruled by the local sheik, a djinn of maximum hit points. 

The social structure of Djinn society is based on rule by a ca- 


126 






liph, served by various nobles and officials (viziers, beys, emirs, 
sheiks, sheriffs, and maliks). A caliph rules all the djinn estates 
within two days travel, and is advised by six viziers who help 
maintain the balance of the landholdings. 

If a landhold is attacked by a large force, a messenger (usually 
the youngest djinni) is sent to the next landhold, which sends aid 
and dispatches two more messengers to warn the next landholds; 
in this fashion the entire nation is warned. 

Noble Djirrn 

Some djinn (1 %) are "noble" and are able to grant three wishes 
to their masters. Noble djinn perform no other services and,

djinn areas strong as efreet, with 10 Hit Dice, They strike for3dS

points of damage, 

Dao 

A dao is a genie from the elemental plane of Earth, While they are 
generally found on that plane (though even there they are un¬ 
common), the dao love to come to the Prime Material plane to 
work evil. Dao speak all of the languages of the genies, as well as 
Common and the tongue of earth elemental. 

Combat: The dao s magical abilities enable them to use any of the 
following magical powers, one at a time, once each per day: 
change self, detect good detect magic, gaseous form, invisibility 
misdirection r passwaU. spectral force , and of stone. They 
can also fulfill another's limited wish (in a perverse way) once 
each day, Dao can use rock to mud three times per day and dig six 
times per day. Dao perform all magic as IStMevel spellcasters. 

A dao can carry up to 500 pounds without tiring. Double 
weight will cause tiring in three turns, but for every 100 pounds 
of weight under 1,000, the dao may add one turn to the duration 
of its carrying ability. After tiring, a dao must rest for one hour. 
Dao can move through earth (not worked stone) at a burrowing 




speed of 6, They cannot take living beings with them, but can 
safely carry inanimate objects. 

Dao are not harmed by earth-related spells, but holy water has 
twice its normal effect upon these monsters, 

Habita ('Society: The dao dwell in the Great Dismal Delve on 
their own plane and in deep caves, caverns, or cysts on the Prime 
Material plane. Dao settle pockets of elemental matter on their 
own plane, bending those pockets to their will and desire. A dao 
mazework contains 4dl0 dao, as well asSdlO elemental and non- 
elemental slaves. Each mazework is ruled by an ataman or het¬ 
man who is advised by a seneschal. The loyalty of a mazeworks 
ataman to the Great Dismal Delve is always questionable, but 
the seneschals are chosen by the khan of the dao, and their loyal¬ 
ty is to him alone. 

The khan of the dao lives at the center of the great mazework 
called the Great Dismal Delve. The land within the delve is said 
to be larger than most Prime Material continents. The Great Dis¬ 
mal Delve is linked to all manner of elemental pockets, so the 
khan can call forth whatever powers he needs. The population of 
dao in the delve is unknown, as is the number of slaves that con¬ 
stantly work the tunnels and clear away damage caused by the 
quakes w T hich frequently shake it. 

Dao dislike servitude as much as efreet and are even more 
prone to malice and revenge than their fiery counterparts, 

Ecologvi The dao manage a thriving business of trade, driven by 
a desire for more power and access to predous gems. High on 
their list of hatreds are most other genies (except efreet, with 
whom they trade worked metals for minerals). They also have 
little use for other elemental creatures: the dao value these only if 
they can exploit them in some fashion. 

Efreet 

The efreet (singular; efreeti) are genies from the elemental plane 
of Fire. They are enemies of the djinn and attack them whenever 
they are encountered, A properly summoned or captured efreeti 


ill 




















Genie 


can be forced to serve for a maximum of 1,001 days, or it can be 
made to fulfill three wishes. Efreet are not willing servants and 
seek to pervert the intent of their masters by adhering to the letter 
of their commands. 

The efreet are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and solid 
Flames. They are massive, solid creatures. 

Combat: An efreeti is able to do the following once per day: 
grant up to three wishes; use invisibility, gaseous form , detect 
magic , enlarge, polymorph self, and wall of fire; create an Ifiu- 
siorf with both visual and audio components which will last with¬ 
out concentration until magically dispelled or touched. An 
efreeti can also produce flame or use pyrotechnics at will. Efreet 
are immune to normal fire^based attacks, and even an attack 
with magical fire suffers a — 1 1 penalty on all attack and damage 
rolls. 

Efreet can carry up to 750 pounds on foot or flying, without 
tiring. They can also carry double weight for a limited time: three 
turns on foot or one turn aloft. For each 150 pounds of weight 
under 1500, add one turn to either walking or flying time permit¬ 
ted, After tiring, the efreeti must rest for one hour. 

Habitat/Society Efreet are infamous for their haEred of servitude, 
desire for revenge, cruel nature, and ability to beguile and mis¬ 
lead. The efreet s primary home is their great citadel, the fabfed 
City of Brass, but there are many other efreet outposts through¬ 
out the plane of Fire. 

An efreet outpost is a haven for 4dl0 efreet and is run as a mili¬ 
tary station to watch or harass others in the plane. These out¬ 
posts are run by a malik or vali of maximum normal hit points. 
There is a 10% chance that the outpost is also providing a tempo¬ 
rary home for ld4 jann or ld4 dao (the only other genies efreet 
tolerate!. Outpost forces are usually directed against incursions 
from the elemental plane of Air. but they can be directed against 
any travelers deemed suitable for threats, robbery, and abuse, 

Efreet are neutral, but tend toward organized evil. They are 
ruled by a grand sultan who makes his home in the City of Brass 
He is advised by a variety of beys, amirs, and maliks concerning 
actions within the plane, and by six great pashas who deal with 
efreet business on the Prime Material plane. 

The City of Brass is a huge citadel that is home to the majority 
of efreet. It hovers in the hot regions of the plane and is often 
bordered by seas of magma and lakes of glowing lava. The city 
sits upon a hemisphere of golden, glowing brass some 40 miles 
across. From the upper towers rise the minarets of the great bas¬ 
tion of the Sultan s Palace, Vast riches are said to be in the palace 
of the sultan. The city has an efreet population that far outnum¬ 
bers the great cities of the Prime Material plane. The sultan 
wields the might of a Greater Power, while many of his advisors 
are akin to Lesser Powers and Demi-Powers. 

Ecology: Fire elemental* tend to avoid the efreet, whom they feel 
are oppressive and opportunistic. Djinn hate them, and there 
have been numerous djinn-efreet dashes, Efreet view most other 
creatures either as enemies or servants, a view that does not en¬ 
dear them to other genies, 

Marid 

The marids are said to be bom of the ocean, having currents for 
muscles and pearls for teeth. These genies from the elemental 
plane of Water are the most powerful of all genies. They are also 
the most individualistic and chaotic of the elemental races, and 
only rarely deign to serve others, 

On their own plane they are rare; marids travel so seldom to 
the Prime Material plane that many consider marids to he crea¬ 
tures of legend only. 



Combat: Marids perform as 26th-level spellcasters, and can use 
any of the following magical powers, one at a time, twice each 
per day: detect evil, detect good, detect invisibility, detect magic, 
invisibility, liquid form (similar to gaseous form), polymorph 
self r and purify water. Marids can use any of the following up to 
seven times per day: gaseous form, lower water, part water wall 
of fog, or water breathing (used on others, lasting up to one full 
day). Once per year a marid can use alter reality, 

Marids can always create -water , which they may direct in a 
powerful jet up to 60 yards long. Victims struck by the jet take 
ld6 points of damage and must make a successful saving throw 
vs, breath weapon or be blinded for ld6 rounds, Marids also 
have the innate ability to water walk (as the ring), 

A marid can carry 1,000 pounds. Double weight causes tiring 
in three turns. For every 200 pounds under 2,000, add one turn to 
the time the marid can carry before tiring, A tired marid must 
rest for one hour. 

Marids swim, breathe water, are at home at any depth, and 
have infravision. They are not harmed by water-based spells. 
Cold-based spells grant them a + 2 bonus to saving throws and 
—2 to each die of damage. Fire inflicts +1 per die of damage, 
with saving throws at a -1 penalty. Steam does not harm them, 

Habitat/Society: Marids live in a loose empire ruled by a padisha. 
Each marid lays some claim to royalty; they are all shahs, ata- 
begs, beglerbegs, or mufti at the very least. There have often 
been several simultaneous "single true heirs" to the padisha's 
throne through the eons, 

A marid household numbers 2dl0 and is located around loose¬ 
ly grouped elemental pockets containing the necessities for marid 
life. Larger groups of marids gather for hunts and tournaments, 
where individual effort is heavily emphasized. 

Marids are champion tale-tellers, although most of their tales 
emphasize their own prowess, and belittle others. When commu* 
nicating with a marid, one must attempt to keep the conversation 
going without continual digression for one tale or another, w T hile

Genie 


not offending the marid. Marids consider it a capital offense for a 
lesser being to offend a marid. 

Marids are both fiercely independent and extremely egoistical. 
They are not easily forced to perform actions; even Lf convinced 
through flattery and bribery to obey, they often stray from their 
intended course to seek some other adventure that promises 
greater glory, or to instruct lesser creatures on the glories of the 
marids. Most mages skilled in summoning and conjuration con¬ 
sider marids to be more trouble than they are worth, which ac¬ 
counts for the great lack of items of marid control (as opposed to 
those affecting efreet and djinn), 

Marids can travel the Ethereal plane, in addition to those 
planes to which all genies can travel. 

Ecology: Marids tolerate their genie relatives, putting up with 
jann and djinn like poor cousins, while they have an aversion to 
efreet and dao. Their attitude toward the rest of the world is simi¬ 
lar; most creatures from other planes are considered lesser be¬ 
ings, not fit to be bothered with unless one lands in the feast hall 
at an inopportune time, 

Janni 

The jann are the weakest of the elemental humanoids known col¬ 
lectively as genies, Jann are formed out of all four elements and 
must therefore spend most of their time on the Prime Material 
plane. In addition to speaking Common and all the languages of 
genies, jann can speak with animals. 

Combat: lann often wear chain mail armor (60% chance), giving 
them an effective AC of 2, They typically use great scimitars 
which inflict 2d8 damage to small and medium creatures, and 
4d4 points of damage to larger opponents. They also use com¬ 
posite long bows. Male jann have exceptional Strength scores; 
roll percentile dice for their Strengths, For female jann, roll per¬ 
centile dice and subtract SO: anything above 0 indicates percent¬ 
age Strength equal to that number, while anything below 
indicates 18 Strength, 

Jann can use one the following magical powers each round: 
enlarge or reduce twice each per day. invisibility three times per 
day; create food and water once per day as a 7th-level priest: and 
ethereahiess (as the armor) once per day for a maximum of one 
hour. lann perform at 12th-level ability, except as noted. 

Habitat. Society Jann favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, 
where they have both privacy and safety, lann society is very 
open, and males and females are regarded as equals. A tribe is 
made up of ld20 + 10 individuals and is ruled by a sheik and one 
or two viziers. Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of 
amir and in times of need they gather and command large forces 
of jann (and sometimes allied humans). 

Many jann tribes are nomadic, traveling with flocks of camels, 
goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann appear 
human m every respect, and are often mistaken for them, unless 
they are attacked. Jann are strong and courageous, and they do 
not take kindly to insult or injury, The territory of a jann tribe 
can extend hundreds of miles in any direction. 

While traveling, male jann Uve in large, colorful tents with 
their wives and married male children, and their families. Mar¬ 
ried daughters move away to Uve with their new husbands. 
When a family eventually grows large enough that it can no long¬ 
er reside comfortably in the tent, a new tent is built, and a son 
takes his wife and family with him to this new dwelling. At per¬ 
manent oases, the jann live not only in tents, but also in elegantly 
styled structures built from materials broughL from any of the 
elemental planes 



Jann are able to dwell in air, earth, fire, or water environments 
for up to 48 hours. This includes the elemental planes, to which 
any janni can travel, even taking up to six individuals along if 
those others hold hands in a circle with the janni. Failure to re¬ 
turn to the Prime Material plane within 48 hours inflicts 1 point 
of damage per additional hour on the jann, until the jann dies or 
returns to the Prime Material plane. Travel to another elemental 
plane is possible, without damage, providing at least tw r o days 
are spent on the Prime Material plane immediately prior to the 
travel. 

Ecology: Jann are suspicious of humans, dislike demihumans, 
and detest humanoids, Jann accept djinn, but shun dao, efreet, 
and marids. They sometimes befriend humans or work with 
them for a desired reward, like potent magical items. 

One ethic the jann share with other nomads is the cultural de¬ 
mand for treating guests with honor and respect. Innocent visi¬ 
tors {including humans) are treated hospitably during their stay, 
but some day might be expected to return the favor. 

Jann Leaders: Jann leaders have 17-18 Intelligence, and 10% have 
19 Strength. Sheiks have up to &amp; Hit Dice, amirs up to 9. Viziers 
have 17-20 Intelligence and the following magical powers, each 
usable three times per day at 12th-levd spellcasting ability: augu¬ 
ry, detect magic, and divination.

Ghosts are the spirits of humans who were either so greatly evil 
in life or whose deaths were so unusually emotional they have 
been cursed with the gift of undcad status. Thus, they roam 
about at night or in places of darkness. These spirits hate good¬ 
ness and life, hungering to draw the living essences from the 
living. 



Combat: As ghosts are non-corporeal (ethereal), they are usu¬ 
ally encountered only by creatures in a like state, although they 
can be seen by non-ethereal creatures. The supernatural power of 
a ghost is such, however, that the mere sight of one causes any 
humanoid being to age 10 years and flee m panic for 2-12 (2d6) 
turns unless a saving throw versus spells is made. Priests above 
6th level are immune to this effect and all other humanoids above 
8th level may add +2 to their saving throws. 

Any creatures within 60 yards of a ghost is subject to attack by 
a tnagic jar. If the ghost fails to magic jar its chosen victim, it 
will then semi-materialize in order to attack by touch (in which 
case the ghost is Armor Class 0). Semi-materialized ghosts can be 
struck only by silver (half damage) or magical weapons (full 
damage). If they strike an opponent it ages him IQ-40 Ud4xlO) 
years. Note that ghosts can be attacked with spells only by crea¬ 
tures who are in an ethereal state. Any human or demi-human 
killed by a ghost is drained of its life essence and is forever dead. 

If the ghost Fails to become semi-material It can only be com¬ 
batted by another In the Ethereal plane (in which case the ghost 
has an Armor Gass of 8). 

Ghosts can be turned by denes after reaching 7th level and can 
be damaged by holy water while in their semi-material form. 

Habitat-Society: In most cases, a ghost is confined to a small 
physical area which the ghost haunts. Those who have heard 
stories of a haunted area can thus attempt to avoid it tor their 
own safety. 

A ghost often has a specific purpose in its haunting, sometimes 
trying to "get even" for something that happened during the 
ghost's life. Thus a woman who was jilted by a lover, and then 
committed suicide, might become a ghost and haunt the couple's 
secret trysting place. Similarly, a man who failed at business 
might appear each night at his storefront or, perhaps, at that of a 
former competitor. 


Another common reason for art individual to become a ghost js 
the denial of a proper burial, A ghost might inhabit the area near 
its body, waiting for a passerby to promise to bury the remains. 
The ghost, in its resentment toward all life, becomes an evil crea¬ 
ture intent on destruction and suffering. 

In rare circumstances, more than one ghost will haunt the same 
location. The classic example of this is the haunted ship, a vessel 
lost at sea, now r ethereal and crewed entirely by ghosts. These 
ships are most often encountered in the presence of St. Elmo's 
fire, an electrical discharge that causes mysterious lights to ap¬ 
pear in the rigging of a ship. 

In many cases, a ghost can be overcome by those who might be 
no match for it in combat simply by setting right whatever events 
led to the attainment of the ghost's undead status. For example, a 
young woman who was betrayed and murdered by someone who 
pretended to love her might be freed from her curse if the cad 
were humiliated and ruined, In many cases, however, a ghost's 
revenge will be far more demanding, often ending in the death of 
the offender. 

Ecology: The dreadful fear caused by the ghost, which ages a 
victim 10 years, is not well understood by the common man. 
who often ascribes it to the fact that a ghost is "dead . 1 ' If this were 
the case, then certainly skeletons and zombies would have the 
same effect, which they do not. 

Common folklore further confuses this fact by relating details 
of the ghost s physical form: the classic example of which is the 
headless horseman, thought by many to be particularly frighten¬ 
ing simply because he had no head. Under this belief, one could 
face a ghost if only one had the courage to stand up to him. Such 
a mistaken impression has cost many lives over the years. Actu¬ 
ally, the fear is caused by the supernatural power of the ghost, 
and has nothing whatsoever to do with courage.

Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the 
flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has 
deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cun¬ 
ning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively, 
Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, 
but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. 
The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from 
cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the 
nails grow strong and sharp like claws. 

Combat: Ghouls attack by clawing with their filthy nails and bit¬ 
ing with their fangs. Their touch causes humans (including dwarves, 
gnomes, half-elves, and halflings, but excluding elves} to became 
rigid unless a saving throw versus paxalyzation is successful. This 
paralysis lasts for 3-6 (2 + ld6) rounds or until negated by a priest. 

Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a ghoulish 
attack will become a ghoul unless blessed (or blessed and then 
resurrected). Obviously, this is also avoided if the victim is de¬ 
voured by the ghouls. Ghoul packs always attack without fear. 

These creatures are subject to ad attack forms except sleep and 
charm spells. They can be turned by priests of any level. The 
magic circle of protection from evil actually keeps ghouls com¬ 
pletely at bay, 

HabitatSocfety: Ghouls and ghasts are most frequently en¬ 
countered around graveyards, where they can find plenty of 
corpses on which to feed. 

Ecology: Ghouls (and ghasts, as described later) delight in re¬ 
volting and loathsome things—from which we draw our adjec¬ 
tives w ghoulish" and "ghastly'’ 

Lace don 

The lacedon is a marine form of the ghoul. Lacedons are some¬ 
times found near marine ghosts, particularly ghost ships. Lace¬ 
dons are less common than ghouls because of the fewer corpses 
available for them to feed on. but they can often be found 
swarming around recent shipwrecks in rivers, lakes, and oceans. 

Ghost 

These creatures are so like ghouls as to be completely indistin¬ 
guishable from them, and they are usually found only with a 
pack of ghouls. When a pack of ghouls and ghasts attacks it will 
quickly become evident that ghasts are present, tor they exude a 
carrion stench in a 10 r radius which causes retching and nausea 


unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Those failing to 
make this save will attack at a penalty of -2. 

Worse, the ghast shares the ghoulish ability to paralyzation, 
and their attack is so potent that it will even affect elves. Paraly¬ 
sis caused by a ghast lasts for 5-10 (4 + ld6) rounds or until ne¬ 
gated by a priest s remove paralysis spell. 

Ghasts, like ghouls, are undead class and thus sleep and charm 
spells do not affect them. Though they can be struck by any sort of 
weapon, cold iron inflicts double normal damage. Clerics can turn 
them beginning at 2nd level The circle of protection from evil does 
not keep them at bay unless it is used in conjunction with cold iron 
(such as a circle of powdered iron or an iron ring}.

Cloud giants consider themselves above all other giants, save 
storm giants, whom they consider equals. They are creative, ap¬ 
preciate fine things, and are master strategists in battle. 

Cloud giants have muscular human builds and handsome, 
well-defined features. The typical cloud giant is 24 feet tali and 
weighs 11,500 pounds. Female cloud giants can be 1 to 2 feet 
shorter and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds lighter. Cloud giants' skin 
ranges in color from a milky-white tinged with blue to a light sky 
blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass and their eyes are an 
iridescent blue. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old. 

A doud giants natural Armor Class is 0, Although they will 
wear no armor, these giants prize magical protection devices, and 
one in 20 will have such a device. Cloud giants dress in dothing 
made of the finest materials available and wear jewelry, Many of 
the giants consider their appearance an indication of their sta¬ 
tion; the more jewelry and the better the clothes, the more impor¬ 
tant the giant, Cloud giants also appreciate music, and the 
majority of giants are able to play one or more instruments (their 
favorite is the harp). Unlike most other giant races, cloud giants 
leave their treasure in their lairs, carrying with them only food, 
throwing rocks. 10-100 UOd'lO) coins, and a musical instrument. 
Cloud giants speak their own tongue and the language of all 
other giants. In addition, 60% of all doud giants speak common. 


Combat; Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using care¬ 
fully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position 
above their opponents, A favorite tactic is to circle the enemy, 
barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities 
assault them with spells. Ooud giants can hurl rocks to a maxi¬ 
mum of 240 yards, causing 2-24 (2dl2) points of damage. Their 
huge momingstars do 6-24 (6d4) +11 points of damage, three 
times normal (man-sized) damage plus their strength bonus. One 
in 10 doud giants will have a magical weapon. 

Habitat/Society: Cloud giants live in small clans ot no more 
than six giants. However, these clans know the location of 1-8 
other clans and will band together with some of these dans for 



celebrations, battles, or to trade. These joined dans will recog¬ 
nize one among them to be their leader—this is usually an older 
doud giant who has magical abilities. One in 10 cloud giants will 
have spells equivalent to a 4th level wizard, and one in 20 cloud 
giants will be the equivalent of a 4th level priest. A cloud giant 
cannot have both priest and wizard abilities. 

If encountered in a lair, half will be immature giants. To deter¬ 
mine a giant's maturity, roll ld4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant 
with no combat ability and hit points of ogre. Rolls of 1-3 indi¬ 
cate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and "to hit" rolls equal 
to that of a fire giant, 

The majority of doud giants live on cloud-covered mountain 
peaks in temperate and sub-tropical areas. These giants make 
their lairs in crude castles. Only 10% of good cloud giants live in 
castles on enchanted clouds. All giants dwelling there are able to 
levitate their own weight plus 2,000 pounds three times a day, 
create a fog cloud three times a day. and create a wall of fog once

There is a 60% chance a doud giant mountain lair will be 
guarded by 1-4 spotted Hons, 2-5 (Id4 + 1) owl bears, or 2-5 
(ld4 +1) griffons (1-2 wyvems for evil doud giants)* In addition, 
there is a 50% chance the Jairs of evil cloud giants will contain 1- 
20 human and demi-human slaves. There is an 80% chance that a 
cloud island lair will be guarded by 2-5 Od4 + I) griffons, 2^8 
(2d4) hippogriffs, or 2-5 (ld4 + 1) giant eagles. 

Cloud lairs are fantastic places with giant-sized gardens of fruit 
trees. According to legend, some giants mine their doud islands 
for small chunks of the purest silver. 

Ecology: Cloud giants prefer food Lhat h carefully prepared 
with spkes and sauces, and they relish fine, aged wines. 

Good doud giants trade with human and demi-human com¬ 
munities for food, wine, jewelry, and doth. Some doud giant 
dans will establish good relations with such communities* and 
will come to the communities' aid if they are endangered. Evil 
doud giants raid human and demi-human communities to get 
vdiat they want.

A diminutive relative of true giants, cyclopskin are single-eyed 
giants that live alone or tn small bands. 

The typical cyclopskin weighs around 350 pounds, and stands 
7Vi feet talk A single large, red eye dominates the center of its 
forehead. Shaggy black or dull, deep blue hair falls in a tangled 
mass about its head and shoulders, its skin tone varies from rud¬ 
dy brown to muddy yellow, and its voice is rough and sharp. 
Cyclopskin commonly dress in ragged animal hides and sandals. 
They smell of equal parts dirt and dung. 

Combat; Cyclopskin are armed with either a club or a bardiche* 
Each will also carry a heavy hurling spear (Ido damage) and a 
sling of great size (ld6 damage). They never wear armor or use 
shields, tor their tough hide gives them ample protection from 
most attacks. 

Cyclopskin do not bother with strategy or tactics in combat. If 
their opponents are out of reach, they use slings or hurl heavy 
spears* They can not throw boulders like their larger cousins. 
Since the single eye of the cyclopskin gives them poor depth per¬ 
ception, they suffer a -2 penalty to all missile attack rolls, but not 
to damage. If the opponents are close, the cyclopskin rush in to 
fight with their dubs or bardiches. 

Habitat Society: The single-eyed humanoids shy away from or¬ 
ganized settlements. If left alone, they tend to leave armed 
groups alone, though they are not above attacking a much weak¬ 
er Force if they stumble across one. Cyclopskin have no regard 
for any form of life other than themselves. Captives are either 
enslaved or eaten* This doesn't happen very often, since the cy- 
dopskin tend to live in remote rocky places. They rarely wander 
more than 10 miles from their caves. 

Being poor hunters, most cydopskin clans keep small herds of 
goats or sheep. Some clans are nomadic, while others stay put in 
their caves Each spring, regional dans meet to exchange goods 
and slaves and to select mates. On rare occasions a charismatic 
cyclopskin will arise and bring together several dans to form a 
wandering tribe. The largest known tribe numbered around SO 
fighting cydopskin. Such a band will aggressively raid outlying 



areas with a boldness uncommon in a single dan. All group deci¬ 
sions are made by the strongest and toughest cydopskin in the 
group, usually through intimidation This in turn leads to brawls 
and fist fights. There are no rules in such fights, and they can lead 
to permanent injury or death For the loser. 

A cydopskin cave is sealed with boulders and there is but one 
entrance* Inside, if size permits, there will be wooden pens to 
house both animals and slaves. The pens always have roofs of 
either wooden bars or the natural cave ceiling. 

At night, a large boulder or stout wooden gate is placed at the 
entrance of the cave to protect the cyclopskin from predators* 
There are no interior fire pits, since cyclopskin use fire infre¬ 
quently, and then only outside their lairs. Any cydopskin trea¬ 
sure will be kept in a sack in the cave 

Ecology; Cydopskin can survive on almost any animal or plant 
diet. They enjoy meal of all sorts and prize it above vegetable 
foods. While they live off the land, they do not live with it. They 
have absolutely no sanitary practices, and rarely even cook their 
meals. They take no care to preserve their environment while 
hunting, and are considered to be one of the easiest creatures of 
their size to track. 

The life of a cydopskin is hazardous, and hence they have a 
short life expectancy. Besides human adventurers, there are many 
predators* such as tigers, giants, wyvems, and trolls, that are not 
above attacking a small group of these giants. However moun¬ 
tain dwarves actually go out of their way to hunt cydopskin, 
receiving the dwarven bonus against giants, 

Cyclops: These larger versions of their slightly more common 
cousins are usually found in the extreme wilds or on isolated is¬ 
lands. where they scratch out a meager existence by shepherding 
their flocks of giant sheep. Cyclopes can hurl boulders up to 150 
yards away, inflicting 410 points of damage*

Desert giants were once numerous in the scrub plains and des¬ 
erts of the Land of Fate, but they have fallen victim to a divine 
curse which transforms them slowly but inexorably into stone. 
They always wander the land m the company of their cattle and 
their mounts. Their great civilization has long since vanished 
under the sands. 

The weathered and craggy faces of the desert giants are scored 
with wrinkles. Even the youngest of desert giants are somewhat 
wrinkled, though this is not visible in the women, as they wear 
the veil. The dark hair and swarthy skin of the desert giants 
make their blue eyes all the more remarkable. However, it is 
considered a dear sign of impending fossihzation when the eyes 
of a desert giant turn from blue to brown. The typical desert 
giant is IT tall and weighs 7,000 pounds, though fossilizing gi¬ 
ants may weigh twice that. Desert giants may live to be 400 
years old. 

Combat; Desert giants fight mounted when they can, though 
steeds of a size to suit them are rare. Battle mounts include gi¬ 
gantic lizards, enormous insects, huge undead horses of shifting 
bone, and even rots. In the past, some desert giants took service 
as bodyguards and mercenaries with the most powerlul of sul¬ 
tans, The sight of a squad of desert giants wheeling about in 
preparation fora charge has caused more than one desert legion 
to break and run. 

Desert giants do not hurl rocks. Indeed, they wander many 
areas where there is often no ready supply of boulders, and car¬ 
rying such heavy objects would tire even the strongest nomadic 
giant. However, they do make large throwing spears from wood 
they find when they pass near jungle lands. These spears are 
kept and cherished as heirlooms over generations. The spears 
have a range of 3 .'6/9 and cause 2-12 + 7 points of damage. Des¬ 
ert giant chieftains sometimes carry great set mi Lars given to 
their ancestors for outstanding military service. These weapons 
cause 2-1 1 + 7 when wielded by anyone with a Strength of 19 or 
better. On occasion, a desert giant wilt attack with one of its 
huge fists, causing 1-10 points damage on a successful attack 

Some desert giants are gifted with the ability to call back their 
ancestors from the stones; they are called sand-shifters because 
of the way the summoned giants throw aside the sands when 
they rise again. Sand-shifters are not priests or mages; they have 
no other special spell abilities. One in every 10 desert giants can 
bring back giants who have assumed the form of stone and can 
command them to fight once more. Once per week* a desert gi¬ 



ant can summon 1-6 giants from the rocks for 2-12 turns; the 
summoning takes one turn. These giants crumble back to rock 
and powder when slain. Desert giant children gifted this way 
can summon 2-20 stony mounts for their elders to ride into bat¬ 
tle. Adult sand-shifters can summon 3-30 mounts instead of 1-6 
giants if they so choose. 

Desert giants' skin is so similar to sand and rock that they can 
camouflage themselves very effectively, if given one turn to pre¬ 
pare, This ability allows them to ambush foes and prey alike. 
(Desert giants who lose their herds often use this ability to be¬ 
come effective bandits, and the numbers of these gigantic brig¬ 
ands have increased as the race dwindles,) A giant so 
camouflaged increases chances of a surprise attack to 1-4 on a 
dl0 and decreases the chance of being seen by search parties or 
soldiers to I in 10, 


Habitat/Society: Desert giants are nomadic herdsmen and are 
rarely found far from their herds. Though they are responsible 
tor stripping entire river valleys bare in fertile areas, they do not 
reimburse farmers or herdsmen on the edge of those territories 
for any damage they might do. They see the lands as theirs for 
the taking, and they make no apology for overgrazing or even 
for grazing their herds on crops. Few- sultanates attempt to force 
them off cropland; most attempt to lure the desert giants away 
with promises of employment as mercenaries. Some will prom¬ 
ise rich gifts of salt* cloth, spices, and metal if only the desert 
giants will return to the empty quarters of the desert. 

Ecology: Desert giants wander hundreds of miles following the 
rains with their herds. When the rains fail, the scrub withers, 
and the herds and their giants starve. At these times young 
males among the desert giants may take up mercenary work and 
use the money they obtain to support the entire tribe. If a 
drought goes on for years, more and more giants are driven into 
the cities, though their absolute numbers are still tiny compared 
to the numbers of humans and other smaller races.

Ettins. or two-headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious 
and unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat 
they can catch. 

An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two 
heads. On closer inspection, however, the creature’s vast differ¬ 
ences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily ap¬ 
parent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to 
be covered in a dark brown hide. This is because an ettin never 
bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a 
thick layer of dirt and grime, Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its 
low Armor Class, An ettins hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; 
its teeth are large, yellowing, and often rotten. The ettin's facial 
features strongly resemble those of an ore—large watery eyes, 
turned-up piggish snout, and large mouth. 

An ettin’s right head is always the dominant one, and the right 
arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular and well- 
developed than the left. An ettin wears only rough, untreated 
skins, which are dirty and unwashed. Obviously ettins smell 
very bad. due to their complete lack of grooming habits—good 
or bad, 

Ettins do not have a true language of their own, Instead, they 
speak a mish-mash of ore. goblin, giant dialects, and the align¬ 
ment tongue of chaotic evil creatures. Any adventurer who 
speaks orrish can understand 50% of what an ettin says. 

Combat: Having two heads Is definitely an advantage lor the 
ettins, as one is always alert, watching for danger and potential 
food- This means that an ettin is surprised only on the roll of a 1 
on IdlO. An ettin also has infra vision up to 90 feet, which en¬ 
ables it to hunt and fight effectively in the dark. 

Though ettins have a low intelligence, they are cunning fight¬ 
ers, They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a 
straight fight, but once the battle has started, ettins usually fight 
furiously until all enemies are dead, or the battle turns against 
them. Ettins do not retreat easily only doing so if victory is im¬ 
possible. 

In combat, an ettin has two attacks, Because each of its two 
heads controls an arm. an ettin does not suffer an attack roll pen¬ 
alty for attacking with both arms. An ettin always attacks with 
two large dubs, often covered with spikes. Using these weapons. 


Giant, Ettin 



the ettin causes 2d8 points of damage with its left arm, and 3d6 
points of damage with its right. If the ettin is disarmed or unable 
to use a weapon, it attacks empty-handed, inflicting IdlO points 
of damage with its left fist and 2d6 points with its right. 

HabitotSodety; Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, 
rocky areas. They dwell in dark, underground caves that stink of 
decaying food and offal. Ettins are generally solitary, and mated 
pairs only stay together for a few months after a young ettin is 
bom to them. Young ettins mature very quickly and within eight 
to ten months after they are bom, they are self-sufficient enough 
to go off on their own. 

On rare occasions, however, a particularly strong ettin may 
gather a small group of Id4 ettins together. This small band of 
eLtins stays together only as long as the leader remains alive and 
undefeated In battle. Any major defeat shatters the leaders hold 
over the band, and they each go their separate ways, 

Ettins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services 
of goblins or ores. These creatures sometimes serve ettins by 
building traps around their lairs, or helping to fight off a power¬ 
ful opponent, Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep 
1-2 cave bears in the area of their lairs. 

The sloppy caves of ettins are a haven for parasites and ver¬ 
min, and it isn't unusual for the ettins themselves to be infected 
with various parasitic diseases. Adventurers rummaging through 
ettin lairs for valuables will find the task disgusting, if not dan¬ 
gerous. 

Ecology: Because ettin society is so primitive, they produce lit¬ 
tle of any value to civilized creatures. Ettins tolerate the presence 
of other creatures, like ores, in the area of their lair if they can be 
useful tn some way. Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently isola¬ 
tionist, crushing trespassers without question.

Of all the giant-kin, the firbolg is the most powerful, due to natu¬ 
ral intelligence and considerable magjcal power. 

Firbolgs appear to be normal humans, except that they are 
over 10 feet tall and weigh over 800 pounds. They wear their hair 
long and keep great, thick beards. Their skin is a normal fleshy 
pink, with any shade of hair color, although blonde and red are 
most common. The flesh and skin of firbolgs are unusually dense 
and tough. Their voices are a smooth, deep bass, thick with roll¬ 
ing consonants. 


Combat: Firbolgs can use any large size weapons; they disdain 
the use of armor or shields. Of manmade weapons, they prefer 
two-handed swords and halberds, both of which they may use in 
one hand without penalty. Weapons of their own make are dou¬ 
ble size equivalents of human weapons, for which they get a 
Strength bonus (19 Strength +7 damage). However, when used 
with both hands, these huge weapons inflict double their normal 
damage, plus the Strength bonus. 

If a firbolg has one hand free, it can bat away up to two mis¬ 
siles per round. Large missiles, such as boulders, or those with 
long shafts, such as javelins and spears, can be caught if desired. 
A catch or bat is successful 75% of the time (6 or better on ld20) . 
A caught weapon may be thrown at any opponent on the next 
round with a ~2 penalty to the attack roll, for using its off hand. 

All firbolgs have the following magical powers, usable once per 
day, on any round they are not engaged in melee combat: detect 
magic, diminution (as double the potion), foob gold, forget , and 
alter self. There is a 5% cumulative chance per member of a group 
that one of the firbolgs is a shaman of 1st through 7th level, 

Firbolgs are cautious and crafty. They have learned to distrust 
and fear humans and demihumans. If possible they avoid an en¬ 
counter, either by hiding or with deception. If forced to fight, 
they do so with great strategy, utilizing the terrain and situation 
to best effect. They operate as a group, not a collection of indi¬ 
viduals , Ten percent of all encounters is a large group of 4d4 
members en route to an enclave of some sort, 


Habitat Society: Firbolgs live in remote forests and hills. These 
giant-kin distrust most other civilized races, and stay well away 



from them. They keep on even terms with druids and the faerie 
creatures, including elves, neither asking nor giving much, but 
avoiding insult or injury. Strangers are met with caution, fre¬ 
quently in illusionary disguise as one of their own race. They do 
not attack or kill without reason, but do enjoy pranks,, particu¬ 
larly those that relieve strangers of treasure. 

Firbolg society is close-knit and centered around the family or 
clan. Each clan has 4d4 members and frequently a shaman* The 
level of the shaman is determined by rolling 2d4-I if the DM 
doesn't wish to choose it himself. The clans live apart from each 
other, existing as gatherers and sometimes nomads, Their homes 
are huge, single-storey, wooden houses with stout walls and a 
central fireplace opening in several directions in the common 
room, When great decisions are needed, the dans involved meet 
in an enclave. This happens at least once a year at the fall sol¬ 
stice, just to celebrate if nothing else. The shamans preside over 
these events, and settle any disputes between clans. 

Ecology: Firbolgs live off the land and with it. Their homes are 
built from trees cleared from around the house. The dan does 
keep a field for harvest, but only enough to supplement their di¬ 
et. They trade tasks involving great strength for food, usually 
with other peaceful folk in the forests or hills. The rest of their 
food is obtained by gathering and hunting an area up to 20 miles 
from their homestead. Meat is used in small quantities for most 
meals, although major celebrations always include a large roast 
of some sort. 

Although many creatures are capable of killing a firbolg, none 
hunt them exclusively. They are stronger than most forest beasts, 
and intelligent creatures know better than to mess with them. 
They avoid true giants, except storm giants, and aggressively re¬ 
pel other giant- kin from their lands.

Fire giants are brutal, ruthless, and militaristic. 

They are tall, but squat, resembling huge dwarves. An adult 
male is 18 feel tall, has a 12 foot chest, and weighs about 7.500 
pounds. Fire giants have coal black skin, flaming red or bright 
orange hair, and prognathous jaws that reveal dirty ivory or yel¬ 
low teeth. They can live to be 350 years old. 

A fire giant's natural Armor Class is 5. Warriors usually wear 
banded mail and round metal helmets (AC -1), They carry their 
belongings in huge sacks. A typical fire giant's sack contains 2-5 
(ld4 +1) throwing rocks, the giants wealth, a tmderbox, and 3- 
12 (3d4) common items. Everything they own is battered, filthy 
and smelly making It difficult to identify valuable items. 

All fire giants can speak the language of all giants and their 
own tongue. 

Combat: Fire giants are immune to nonmagical fire and heat, as 
well as red dragon breath. They are resistant to all types of magi¬ 
cal fire: such attacks inflict -1 hit point per die of damage. Adult 
fire giants can hurl rocks for 2-20 (2dl0) points of damage. Their 
minimum range is 3 yards while their maximum is 200 yards. 
They can catch similar large missiles 50% of the time. They usu¬ 
ally fight in disciplined groups, throwing rocks until they run out 
of ammunition or the opponent closes. Fire giants often wait in 
ambush at lava pools or hot springs, hurling heated rocks at vic¬ 
tims for an extra 1 -6 points of damage. 

Warriors favor huge two-handed swords, A fire giant's over¬ 
sized weapons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all op¬ 
ponents, plus the giants strength bonus. Thus, a fire giant 
two-handed sword does 2-20 (2dI0) +10 points of damage. 

HabrtatSoriety: Fire giants live in well organized military groups, 
occupying large castles or caverns, When encountered in their lair 
there will be 13-20 (ld8 +12) giants, half of whom will be immature 
giants. To determine a giant's maturity roll ld4, A roll of 4 indicates 
an infant with no combat ability and Lhe hit points of an ogre while 
rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with Hit Dice, damage, and attack 



rolls reduced by 1, 2 or 3, respectively. 

Their lairs are always protected by vigilant watchmen, and 
sometimes by traps. Fire giants favor deadfalls that can crush in¬ 
truders tor 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and large crossbow de¬ 
vices that fire one, two, or three huge bolts for 2-16 (2d8) points 
of damage each. 

Particularly intelligent fire giant leaders will command groups 
three or four times normal size. One who commands 30 or more 
giants usually will call himself a king. Kings always will have bet¬ 
ter than normal armor and a magical weapon of +1 to +3. 

There is a 20% chance that any band of fire giants will have a 
shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%), If the group is lead by a 
king, there is an 80% chance of a spell caster. Fire giant shamans 
are priests of up to 7th level. A shaman can cast normal or re¬ 
versed spells from the Elemental, Healing, Charm, Protection, 
Divination, or Combat spheres. Fire giant witch doctors are 
priest/wizards of up to 7th '3rd level; they prefer spells that can 
detect or thwart intruders. 

Fire giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards. 
There is a 50% chance that a fire giant lair will contain 1-4 hell 
hounds. Larger than normal groups check once for every 10 gi¬ 
ants. Bands with 30 or more giants have a additional 30% chance 
to have 2-5 (Id4 + 1) trolls, larger groups check once for every 20 
giants, A kings group has a 20% chance to have 1-2 red dragons 
of age category 2-5 Ud4 + 1) in addition to other guards. Fire gi¬ 
ants frequently take captives to hold for ransom or use as slaves. 
There is a 2S% chance that a lair will contain 1-2 captives, larger 
bands check once per 10 giants. 

Ecology: Fire giants live wherever there is a lot of heat. They 
prefer volcanic regions or areas with hot springs. Frequen tly they 
share their lairs with other fire-dwelling creatures such as sala¬ 
manders or fire elemental*, 

Fire giants prefer to eat meat and bread, they can hunt and kill 
their own meat, but raid human and demi-human settlements for 
grain, captives, and treasure.

Cousins to the cloud giants, these targe rock-hurlers are more 
intelligent and stealthy than portrayed in story or song. 

Fog giants are huge and husky, with tree-trunk sized legs, and 
over-developed arms muscled by constant throwing games and 
exercises. They have milk-white skin which aids their natural 
ability to blend into fog (80% chance) and gives their foes a —5 
penalty to their surprise rolls when attacking in fog or mist. 
Their hair is silvery white and flowing, with ample hair on the 
arms, legs and chest. They grow no facial hair whatsoever. 
They prefer to wear no armor, counting on their high natural 
Armor Class. However, they occasionally wear leather armor 
(AC -”2), and at least one band wears armor made from white 
dragon hides studded with silver. They love massive, ornate 
clubs made from bleached and polished wood or bone. Fog gi¬ 
ants speak their own tongue and Cloud Giant, and 30% speak 
Common. 


Combat: Fog giants generally hunt in groups of 2-5 males, al¬ 
though they sometimes join with a cloud giant or two to form a 
hunting party of 3-7. They prefer to attack from cover (fog is 
most preferred ). After some ranged rock-hurling to scatter their 
opponents, they will charge into melee with fists and swords fly¬ 
ing. Adult fog giants can hurl rocks up to 3-240 yards, inflicting 
2-20 points of damage to anyone struck. They also have a 45% 
chance of catching hurled weapons of similar size, but cannot 
catch fired weapons such as arrows, bolts, and sling-stones, In 
melee they generally fighL with dubs and fists, though tales of 
sword-armed fog giants are common. 

Because of their keen hearing and highly-developed sense of 
smell, fog giants are seldom surprised { + 2 on surprise rolls). 
Access to their caves and regular hunting camps are often pro¬ 
tected by deadfalls of rocks or logs, which can be released by a 
carefully thrown rock at the first sign of an attack against them. 

Habitat Society: Fog giants are proud of their strength and fight¬ 
ing skills, often playing games when on hunting forays in an 
attempt to best one another. Their favorite such game is called 
"copsi" and consists of the giants pairing off to toss larger and 
larger boulders to their partners until one of the pairs misses its 
throw. 

The fog giant families live in caves canyons, or thickets, in 
the most inaccessible areas of marsh, swamp, forest, or coast. 



The men usually hunt in groups, ranging up to a dozen miles 
from their homes. The groups generally are formed of giants of 
similar alignment. 

By tradition, a young giant may not mate until he has ob¬ 
tained at least one large ornament of silver. Usually, the young 
giant joins with several others in a quest to find one (or acquire 
enough treasure to buy one). 

Fog giants do not often mix well with other creatures or races, 
although they can often be persuaded to perform services for a 
fee, or barter goods with groups of similar alignment. Fog giants 
will happily barter goods and services for refined silver 

Territorial disputes sometimes flare up between groups, espe¬ 
cially in times of bad hunting. Friendly disputes can sometimes 
be resolved by a game of cops* or an arm-wrestling match. Fog 
giants fighting amongst themselves will generally throw rocks 
and fist-fight, rather than use swords. 

Fog giants are fond of all sorts of cooked meats, particularly 
hoofed creatures such as horses, cows, deer f elk, and centaur. 
They often cook meat by building a large fire, then impaling 
chunks of meat on their swords and holding them over the open 
Flame. Fog giants prefer fruits and sweets for dessert, and will 
also down large quantities of spirits tf available to them. They 
do not distill their own spirits or liquors. They also sometimes 
smoke fresh milkweed pods in wooden pipes, though the taste is 
too bitter for humans and demthumarts to enjoy 

Ecology: Because of their size, fog giants consume a large quan¬ 
tity of food, and require a considerable territory per hunting 
group to support themselves. The giants will often place territo¬ 
rial markers of boulders and logs to define the boundaries be¬ 
tween their hunting territories. They do not look kindly on 
anyone who tears down or moves these markers. Their regular 
pathways are hard to hide, and are instead trapped with dead¬ 
falls of rocks and logs to discourage trespassers.

Fomorians are the most hideous, deformed, and wicked of all 
giant-kin. 

The fomorian giants are all grossly deformed behemoths* Each 
has a different set of deformities, which must be determined by 
the DM. A partial list of deformations includes misplaced limb, 
misshapen limb, misplaced facial feature, hunchbacked, bulging 
body part, drooping flesh, body part too big or too small, 
flapping ears, huge snout, large feet on short legs. Their thick, 
hairy hides, combined with the pelts and odd metal bits they 
wear for protection, give an effective AC of 3. They have 
scattered patches of hair as tough as wire on their pale white skin. 
Large warts and other growths are scattered across their bodies. 
There is no single odor associated with fomorians; some smell 
strongly due to overactive sweat glands, others have no smell. 
Their voices are also each different due to their unique 
deformities. 

Combat: Fomorians use all manner of clubs and other blunt 
instruments. Regardless of the weapon, it inflicts double damage 
plus 8 points for Strength, while their fists alone inflict 2d4+8 
points of damage. Their deformities prevent them from hurling 
boulders as true giants. They work any bits of metal they can 
find and scavenge into their clothing, to aid their Armor Class, 
The typical fomorian is AC 3, while a particularly well-armored 
one, or one with a shield, might get an AC as good as 1, but no 
better. 

Typical fomorian strategy is too sneak up on an opponent and 
hit him as hard as it can. It works well for them since their 
opponents suffer a -2 penalty to their surprise rolls, because the 
fomorians move slowly and carefully. These giant-kin are only 
surprised on a 1 on the Id 10 surprise roil, because they tend to 
have eyes and ears in odd places on their heads. If the fomorian 
bothers to keep an opponent alive, he is crudely tortured until 
dead, and then eaten. 


Habitat Society: Fomorians live in mountain caves, abandoned 
mines, or other subterranean realms, They rarely modify their 



homes, but adapt to what is already there. These deformed giants 
wander throughout the underground complex, for almost any 
distance, stopped only by hazards they do not want to challenge. 
A fomorian clan picks a small, (to them) defensible alcove For a 
lair. Their territories are sometimes marked by the bodies of their 
enemies. Their treasure consists only of stolen items from 
enemies. Pieces of armor are added to their own patchwork 
protection. Since they do not care for it, this armor quickly 
deteriorates and becomes worthless. 

Their society is ruled by depravity and wickedness. The 
strongest and cruelest giant rules over all the others within reach, 
which is usually a small number. The women and children are 
treated as slaves. Acts of violence are common among 
fomorians. sometimes resulting in permanent injury or death. 

Fomorian giants have been known to work with other 
creatures for evil causes. Usually the other creatures must 
completely dominate the fomorians, or be capable of it, to form 
the alliance. Such an agreement lasts only as long as the 
fomorians fear their cohorts. Once their interests no longer 
coincide or the fomorians no longer feel threatened, they 
double-cross their partners, as quickly as possible. 

Ecology: These twisted giants can live for weeks on little or no 
food, This is good, because their underground dwellings do not 
provide an abundance of it They can eat almost any organic 
material, including fungi, lichens, plants of all sorts, bats, mice 
and fish. They particularly savor the taste of large mammals, 
especially those that beg not to be eaten. Preparing a meal 
usually involves torture rather than any efforts to improve its 
taste.

Like all evil giants, frost giants have a reputation for crudeness 
and stupidity. This reputation is deserved, but frost giants are 
crafty fighters. 

Frost giants have muscular, roughly human builds. The typical 
adult male is 2T tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds. Females are 
slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. 
Frost giants have snow-white or ivory skin. Their hair is light 
blue or dirty yellow, with matching eyes. They can live to be 250 
years old. 

A frost giant's natural Armor Class is 5, Warriors usually wear 
chain mail and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers 
(AC 0). They also wear skins and pelts, along with any jewelry 
they own* 

Frost giants carry their belongings in huge sacks, A typical 
frost giant s sack contains 2-5 Ud4+1) throwing rocks, the gi¬ 
ants wealth, and 3-12 (3d4l mundane items. Everything in a gi- 
ants bag is old, worn, dirty, and smelly, making the 
identification of any valuable items difficult. 

Frost giants speak their own language and the language com¬ 
mon to all giants. 

Combat: Frost giants are immune to cold. Adult frost giants 
can hurl rocks for 2-20 (2dl0) points of damage. Their minimum 
range is 3 yards while their maximum is 200 yards. They can 
catch similar large missiles 40% of the time. They usually will 
start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of 
ammunition, or the opponent closes. One of their favorite strate¬ 
gies is to ambush victims by hiding buried in the snow at the top 
of an tcy or snowy slope where opponents will have difficulty 
reaching them. 

Warriors favor huge battle axes. A frost giant's oversized 
weapons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all oppo¬ 
nents, plus the giants strength bonus. Thus, a frost giant battle 
axe does 2-16 (2d8) +9 points of damage. 

Habitat Society: Frost giants live in small bands consisting of a 
chief, his henchmen, and their camp followers, A band usually 



will occupy a crude castle or frigid cavern. When encountered in 
their lair there will be 9-16 Id8 + S) giants; half of whom will be 
immature, To determine a giant's maturity roll ld4. A roll of 4 
indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre; 
rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and at¬ 
tack rolls equal to that of a stone giant. 

Particularly strong or intelligent frost giant chieftains will 
command bands three or four times normal size. A chieftain who 
commands 20 or more giants is called a jarl. laris always will 
have better than normal armor and a weapon of +1 to +3 en¬ 
chantment. 

There is a 20% chance that any band of frost giants will have a 
shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%). If the group is led by a 
jarl, there is an 80% chance for a spell caster. Frost giant shamans 
are priests of up to 7th level. A shaman can cast normal or re¬ 
versed spells from the healing, charm, protection, divination , or 
weather spheres. Frost giant witch doctors are priest/wizards of 
up to 7th/3rd level: they prefer spells that can bewilder and con¬ 
found other giants. Favorite spells include: unseen servant, 
shocking grasp . detect magic , ventriloquism, deeppockets . ESP 
mirror image, and mrisfhiJffy. 

Frost giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards, 
There is a 50% chance that a frost giant lair will contain 1-6 
winter wolves* Larger than normal groups check once for every 
eight giants, Bands with 20 or more giants have a additional 30% 
chance to have 1-4 yeti, larger groups check once for every 16 
giants, A jaiTs band has a 20% chance to have 1-2 subdued white 
dragons in addition to other guards. The dragons w'ill be age cat¬ 
egory 2-5 Ud4 + 1L Frost giants also take captives to hold for 
ransom or use as slaves. There is a 15% chance that a lair will 
contain 1-2 captives, larger bands check once per eight giants. 
Captives can be of any race. 

Ecology: Frost giants live in frigid, arctic lands with glaciers 
and heavy snowfall. Frost giants eat mostly meat, which they can 
hunt and kill themselves. They raid human and demj-human 
settlements for foodstuffs and other booty.

Hill giants are selfish, cunning brutes who survive through hunt¬ 
ing and by terrorizing and raiding nearby communities. Despite 
their low intelligence, they are capable fighters. 

Hill giants are oddly simian and barbaric in appearance, with 
overly long arms, stooped shoulders, and low foreheads, Even 
though they are the smallest of the giants, their limbs are more 
muscular and massive than those of the other giant races. The 
average hdl giant is 16 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. 
Females have the same builds as males. Their skin color ranges 
from a light tan to a deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or 
black, and their eyes are black. Hill giants can live to be 200 years 
old. 

Hill giants' natural Armor Gass is 5. This is reduced to an Ar¬ 
mor Class of 3 when they wear crudely-sewn animal hides, which 
are the equivalent of leather armor. Nearly all hill giants wear 
these hides, which are a symbol of esteem in some hill giant 
communities—the more hides a giant has, the more large kills to 
his credit, Only a few (5%) of the giants fashion metal armor 
from the armor of men they have defeated. These giants have an 
Armor Class of 0. Like other races of giants, hill giants carry their 
belongings with them in huge hide sacks, A typical hill giant s 
bag will contain 2-8 &lt;2d4J throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, and 
1-8 additional common items. 

Hill giants speak their own language and a tongue common to 
all giants. In addition, 50% also speak ogre. 

Combat: Hill giants preter to fighL their opponents from high 
rocky outcroppings where they can pelt their targets with rocks 
and boulders while limiting the risks posed to themselves. 

Hill giants" favorite weapons are oversized clubs which do 2-12 
+ 7 points of damage (double the damage of a man-sized dub 
plus their strength bonus). They hurl rocks for 2-16 (2d8) points 
of damage. Their targets for such attacks must be between 3 and 
200 yards away from the giant. They can catch rocks or other 
similar missiles 30% of the time. 

Habitat Society: A hill giant lair will have 9-16 (ld8 +8) giants: 
usually an extended family. Sometimes these families will accept 
lone hill giants into their folds. If six or more giants are encoun¬ 


1 



tered in a lair, half of them will be male, one quarter will be fe¬ 
male, and the remainder will be immature giants. To determine a 
giant's maturity, roil ld4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no 
combat ability and hit points of gnoll: roils of 1-3 indicate older 
progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to that of 
an ogre. 

Occasionally a hill giant with an average intelligence can be 
found. Such a giant is capable of rallying bands of his peers so 2, 
3, or 4 times the number of giants usually appearing can be en¬ 
countered. These 'giant kings," as they call themselves, stage 
raids on human towns or against other races of giants. 

Although hill giants prefer temperate areas, they can be found 
in practically any climate where there is an abundance of hills 
and mountains. They lair in caves, excavated dens, or crude 
huts. Those who live in colder climates have developed more 
skills with preparing and using skins to keep themselves warm 
and to keep the harsh winds out of their lairs. 

There is a 50% chance a band of hill giants will have guards in 
their lairs, and the guarding creatures will be 2-8 (2d4) dire 
wolves (50%), 1-3 giant lizards (30%), or a group of 2-8 (2d4i 
ogres (20%), 

The majority of hill giants are suspicious of magic and will 
seek to destroy magic items they acquire as treasure. They cere¬ 
monially kill mages. 

Ecology: Hill giants' main diet consists of meat, which they ob¬ 
tain by hunting. The flesh of young green dragons is considered a 
delicacy, and frequently giants who live on hills and mountains 
covered with forests will organize hunting parties in search of 
green dragon lairs. In turn, green dragons have been known to 
hunt hill giants, 

Sometimes bands of hill giants will trade with each other or 
with bands of ogres to get foodstuffs and trinkets.

Powerful, lanky, and strictly carnivorous, jungle giants are a 
terror to all the animals of the tropical forests. They are great 
hunters and stalkers, able to clear a huge tract of forest of all 
game and then move on. 

A typical jungle giant stands 18' tall yet weighs only 3,000 
pounds“Very thin for a giant. Females are generally taller than 
males. They can live to be 200 years old. 

Jungle giants always carry everything they need with them; 
tools for making and maintaining their weapons, fire-starters, 
tinder and spare bits of leather and sinew used to repair cloth¬ 
ing. They also carry their valuables, and every adult jungle gi¬ 
ant carries a qui ver of arrows. 

Jungle giants speak their own language and the languages of 
tribes of nearby humans and humanoids. 

Thin and very tall jungle giants easily blend into the vertical 
landscape of the tropical forest. Their wavy hair is pale green, 
and their skin is a rich muddy yellow, like sunlight on the forest 
floor. They rarely wear more dothing than strictly necessary, as 
they prefer complete freedom of movement when hunting. 
Many groups of jungle giants use ritual tattooing, colorful 
feather headdresses and even filed teeth to show their fierce¬ 
ness. They sometimes decorate themselves with mud. sticks, 
and leaves when stalking especially large or wary game. 

Combat: Jungle giants use 15' long bows crafted to take advan¬ 
tage of their tremendous size and strength. These giants are very 
quick with their huge bows and can fire two arrows each round. 
They will use poisoned arrows to bring down their prey more 
quickly. If these arrows are used in combat, opponents must 
save vs* paralyzation at ^2 or be rendered immobile for 2-12 
turns. Even humanoid creatures with the strength to pull a jun¬ 
gle giant bow cannot use it. because the arrows are over 6' long 
(2d6 +9 damage). Jungle giants will occasionally use the trunk 
of a dead tree as a dub. doing 2d8 +9 points damage. 

Jungle giants prefer to take their prey from ambushes, firing 
their bows from the treetops and then swinging down sturdy 
branches or thick ropes to finish off their prey. Camouflaged gi¬ 
ants cause a - ! penalty on opponents surprise rolls. When set¬ 
ting up a blind, they can camouflage themselves in jungle terrain 
with a 60% chance of success. Setting up a blind or decorating 
themselves with jungle camouflage takes three turns. 



Habitat-Society: Jungle giants are friendlier than most other 
races of giants, and they will often cooperate with human jungle 
tribes on hunts. The giants provide strength and raw power, and 
the humans provide the numbers and skill to drive animals into 
ambushes. 

Jungle giants have absolutely no compunctions about eating 
any form of meat—mammal, reptile, amphibian, or avian. 
They know r how to stalk, kill, and prepare everything from eggs 
to full-grown animals, and from scavengers to predators. Their 
villages reflect this carnivorous tendency; the huts are made 
from wooden posts with roofs of greased animal hides stitched 
together with intestines. The smell of smoking meats and butch¬ 
ery hang in the air, and huge quantities of dragonflies and other 
insects swarm around the villages. A jungle giant village is 50% 
likely to shelter 1-6 giant dragonflies. 

Ecology: Jungle giants think of most creatures as prey, but those 
they accept as fellow hunters they respect as equals, regardless 
of their size. Although they much prefer the jungle terrain they 
know so well, they are often forced to leave the trees for the 
savanna when their numbers become too great to survive in the 
jungle. They think nothing of eating every snake, antelope, cat. 
warthog, ostrich, and elephant they come across. Jungle giants 
on the savannah often return to the forest, because their great 
height makes stealthy hunting difficult for them on open 
ground.

Mountain giants are huge humanoids that live in remote moun¬ 
tain caverns. 

Standing 14 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds, mountain gi¬ 
ants are impressive foes. They greatly resemble hill giants. Their 
skin color is a light tan to reddish brown with straight black hair. 
The males have heavy beards but no mustaches, and they have 
large pot bellies. They are typically clothed in rough hides or 
skins and carry huge dubs as weapons. The stale reek of a moun¬ 
tain giant can be defected several hundred feet downwind. 

Combat: Mountain giants always attack in a straightforward 
manner, not by ambush or deceit. They love to get into a high, 
unassailable spot with lots of boulders. When in such a position, 
mountain giants rarely take cover, but stand in the open to fling 
their missiles. They can hurl boulders down on their opponents 
for 2dl0 points of damage each. They can catch similar missiles 
3G% of the time. 

In melee they use huge dubs that cause 4dl0 + IO points of 
damage, including their Strength bonus. These clubs are usually 
just large tree limbs or logs. They usually keep several such 
weapons around. Mountain giants are as strong as fire giants 
( 22 ) 

A mountain giant can summon and control other monsters. 
This summoning takes a full turn to perforin and ld6 hours pass 
before the creatures appear. A summoning results in either 
ldlQ + 5 ogres (70 %) r Ido+3 trolls (20%), or ld4 hill giants 
(10%), although the giant has no idea in advance of what he will 
get. The control is very loose, not absolute domination. The 
mountain giant can give a broadly defined command and the 
monsters obey as they see fit. The summoned monsters stay with 
and fight for the mountain giant, but they value (heir own lives 
over that of the giant. The summoned creatures stay with the gi¬ 
ant until killed, sent away* or another summoning is made. 

Habitat Society: The home of a family of mountain giants is of¬ 
ten in a large rock cavern in a mountain. Frequently there are 
unexplored passages leading out of the giants' home. They rarely 
have any interest in anything beyond their cavern. There is a 



75% chance of summoned creatures acting as guards and under¬ 
lings in the cavern. 


The females and young are rarely seen, since they stick dose to 
the cavern. Mountain giants are polygamous, usually one female 
living with several males, Three quarters of the young are male, 
which accounts for their low population* if two or more moun¬ 
tain giants are in a lair, there is a 50% chance of a female and a 
25% chance of a child. Roll ld4 to determine the age of the child. 
If it is a 4, it is a helpless infant or small child. A roll of 1-3 indi¬ 
cates older children or teens that have the Hit Dice, damage, and 
attack rolls of hill giants. 

There is a 20% chance that one of the giants in a family is a 
shaman. Roll ld6 to determine the level of spell use, J-4 meaning 
1st level 5-6 indicating 2nd level. This shaman can cast from the 
spheres of All, Animal, Charm, Combat. Elemental, and Heal¬ 
ing. He has an innate ability to find caves and cavern entrances 
within half a mile, unless these are magically hidden. 

While only one family is found in a given lair, several families 
make up a loose tribe scattered over a mountain or range. Each 
tribe has a 3rd-kvel shaman as its leader, He presides over the 
extremely rare gatherings of the tribe and counsels those willing 
to travel to talk to him. The shaman always lives with a group of 
summoned monsters, but never with other mountain giants. 

Ecology: Mountain giants are foragers and hunters, Their fa¬ 
vorite food is mountain sheep, They also eat nuts, tubers, and 
other edible mountain plants. Nothing hunts mountain giants, 
but sometimes they pick the wrong cave in which to set up house¬ 
keeping* Since they tend not to fully explore all the back tunnels, 
nasty things from underground have been known to attack and 
devour sleeping giants. 

Since these giants are neither good nor evil, it is possible to set 
up peaceful relations with them. However, they are suspicious of 
and reluctant to deal with outsiders.

Reef giants are the loners of gjant-kind, although they often live 
in remarkably well-appointed mansions that seem to be no more 
than huts from the outside. They sometimes become sailors, but 
their huge mass limits them to the largest of vessels. Reef giants 
are typically 16' tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Reef giants can 
live to be 600 years old. 

Reel giants speak their own language as well as the giantish 
trade tongue and the languages of storm and cloud giants. In 
addition, 40% of the giants also speak the common longue. 

Reef giants have burnished coppery skin and pale white hair. 
They are barrel-chested and powerfully-muscled from the exer¬ 
tion of forcing their huge bodies through water. Reef giants have 
a Strength of 22. Reef giants wear skins or garments made of 
braided hair when ashore, but swim wearing no more than a 
belt for knives and pouches. 


Combat: Reef giants prefer to fight in or under water, and they 
are fierce fighters when angered. They suffer no penalties when 
fighting in or under water. They cannot be harmed by water- or 
ice-based attack forms. They typically attack with giant tridents 
for 2-20 +10 points of damage, but have been known to lash 
out with a huge fist f IdlO points damage) now and again. 

Once per day a reef giant can form a whirlpool. Unless a suc¬ 
cessful Strength ability check is made, creatures within 10 yards 
of the giant are sucked into the whirlpool and suffer 2-16 points 
of battering damage plus 2-20 points drowning and choking 
damage (unless the creatures arc able to breathe water, m which 
case only the battering damage applies). The whirlpool is not 
powerful enough to draw in ships, 

Reef giants can throw boulders up to 350 yards for 3-30 
(3dl0) points of damage. They prefer to use thrown boulders to 
sink unwelcome ships. Boulders are not used againsl individual 
opponents. 


Habitat Society: Reef giants are often solitary for long periods 
of time, although they mate for life. When their children reach 
puberty, they are sent out on their own to seek an island or reef 
habitat to make their heme, 



The mansions of reef giants are sometimes built into the hills 
and gorges of the islands, and they are always stocked with fur¬ 
niture and decorations collected over generations. These man¬ 
sions are passed on from one giant to another; the eldest 
daughter is generally reared to provide for her parents as they 
grow old and is usually given the mansion and all its goods upon 
their death. These welkdowried daughters are the objects of 
much competition between reef giant suitors, each of whom 
seeks to both prove himself to the new mistress of the mansion 
and undo his competitors by any means available. Diving, surf¬ 
ing, and fishing competitions are common in reef giant court¬ 
ship. 

Ecology: Reef giants are scavengers who fish and forage coral 
reefs for a hundred different sources of food. They can net entire 
schools of fjsh, and as accomplished divers they can retrieve 
hoards of pearls, sponges, and coral. Their enormous strength 
allows them to swim for hours at a time without tiring. In this 
way reel giants can ama&amp;s huge amounts of goods to trade for 
other items. 

Some reef giants keep docks of goats or sheep on their island 
homes, but these giants are generally elderly and not as capable 
of foraging successfully. 

Reef giants frequently enter into contracts or trade agree¬ 
ments with humans and other mercanlile races. In exchange for 
pearls and other valuables from the sea, they are given cloth, 
sweets, and metal goods. 

The reef giants willingness to plunder the sea has made them 
the enemies of merfolk, tritons, and other ocean-dwelling races.

Giant, Stone 



Stone giants are lean, but muscular. Their hard, hairless flesh is 
smooth and gray, making it easy for them to blend in with their 
mountainous surroundings. Their gaunt facial features and deep, 
sunken black eyes make them seem perpetually grim. 

The typical stone giant is 10' tall and weighs 9,000 pounds be¬ 
cause of its dense flesh. Females are a little shorter and lighter. 
The giants' natural Armor Class is 0. They do not wear armor to 
augment that, preferring to wear stone-colored garments. Stone 
giants can live to be 800 years old. 

Stone giants, like several other giant races, carry some of their 
belongings with them. They leave their more valuable items in 
their lairs, however. A typical stone giant's bag will contain 2-24 
(2dl2) throwing rocks, a portion of the giant's wealth, and 1-8 
additional common items. 

Stone giants speak their own language, as well as those of hill 
giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. In addition, 50% of the 
giants also speak the common language of man. 

Combat: When possible, stone giants Fight from a distance. 
They are able to hurl rocks a minimum distance of 3 yards to a 
maximum distance of 300 yards, doing 3-30 (3dl0) points of 
damage with each rock. These giants are able to catch stones and 
similar missiles 90% of the time. A favorite tactic of stone giants 
is to stand nearly motionless against rocks, blending in with the 
background, then moving forward to throw rocks, surprising 
their foes. Many giants set up piles of rocks near their lair which 
can be triggered like an avalanche when intruders get too dose. 

When stone giants are forced into melee combat, they use large 
clubs chiseled out of stone which do 2-12 (2d6) +8 points of dam¬ 
age; double normal (man-sizedI club damage plus the giants 
strength bonus. 

Habitat Society: Stone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high 
on rocky, storm-swept mountains. They normally live in the 
company of their relatives, though such a dans usually include 
no more than 10 giants. Clans of giants do locate their lairs near 


each other, however, for a sense of community and protection. A 
mountain range commonly has 2-8 dans lairing there. 

Stone giants are crude artists, painting scenes of their lives on 
the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some giants are 
fond of music and play stone flutes and drums, Others make sim¬ 
ple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads into necklaces. 

If eight or more giants are encountered in a dan's lair, one 
quarter will be female, one quarter male, and the remainder off¬ 
spring. To determine a giant's maturity roll ld4, A roll ot 4 indi¬ 
cates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of an ogre: 
rolls of T3 indicate older progeny wi th hit dice, damage, and at¬ 
tack rolls equal to those of a hill giant. 

One in 20 stone giants develop special abilities related to their 
environment. These giant elders are able to stone shape, stone 
te/L and transmute? rock to mud (or mud to rock) once per day as 
if they were 5th level mages. One in 10 of these exceptional giants 
can also cast spells as if he were a 3rd level wizard. Their spells 
can be determined randomly or chosen to fit a specific encounter 
as desired. Frequently these giants are able to rise to positions of 
power and are considered the leaders of several clans. 

Stone giants are usually found to mountain ranges in temper¬ 
ate and sub-tropical areas. Stone giants are fond of cave bears 
and 75% of their lairs will have 1-8 of them as guards, The tew 
stone giants living in cold areas use polar bears as guards. 

Stone giants are playful, especially at night. They are tond of 
rock throwing contests and other games that test their might. 
Tribes of giants mil often gather to toss rocks at each other, the 
losing side being the giants who are hit more often. 

Ecology: Stone giants are omnivorous, but they will eat only 
fresh food. They cook and eat their meat quickly after i t has been 
killed. They use the skins of the animals for blankets and trade 
what they do not need with nearby human communities in ex¬ 
change for bolts of cloth or herd animals which they use for food. 
Many stone giant bands keep giant goats in and near their lairs so 
they will have a continuous supply of milk, cheese, and butter.

Storm giants are gentle and reclusive. They are usually tolerant 
of others, but can be very dangerous when angry. 

Storm giants resemble well-formed humans of gargantuan pro¬ 
portions, Adult males and females are about 26' tall and weigh 
about 15,000 pounds. Storm giants have pale, light green or 
(rarely) violet skin. Green-skinned storm giants have dark green 
hair and glittering emerald eyes, Violet-skinned storm giants 
have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple 
eyes. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old. 

A storm giant s garb usually is a short, loose tunic belted at the 
waist, sandals or bare Feet, and a headband. They wear a few 
pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry: anklets (favored by 
bare-footed giants), rings, or circlets being most common. 

Storm giants usually carry pouches attached to their belts. 
These hold only a few tools, necessities, and a simple musical 
instrument—usually a panpipe or harp. Other than the jewelry 
they wear, they prefer to leave their wealth in their lairs. 

They speak their own language as well as cloud giant, the tongue 
common to all giants, and the common tongue of humankind. 

Combat: AH storm giants are immune to electricity and light¬ 
ning. They use weapons and special abilities instead of hurling 
rocks, but can catch large missiles 65% of the time. 

Storm giants are bom with tunter breathing ability and can 
move, attack, and use magic under water as if they were on land. 
Juvenile and adult storm giants can cast control weather and levi¬ 
tate spells lifting their own weight and as much as 4,000 addition¬ 
al pounds twice a day Adult storm giants also can call lightning 
(3 bolts ot 15 8-sided dice each), lightrtmg bolt (1 bolt of 15 6- 
sided dice), control winds, and use meat her summoning once a 
day. A storm giant uses its magical abilities at I5th level. An an¬ 
gry storm giant usually will summon a storm and ra/J lightning 

They employ gigantic two-handed swords in battle, A storm 
giant s oversized weapons do triple normal (man-sized) damage 
to all opponents, plus the giant s strength bonus. Thus, a storm 
giant s two-handed sword does 3-30 &lt;3d 10) +12 points of dam¬ 


age. They also use massive composite bows which have a 300 
yard range and do 3-18 (3d6) points ot damage. There is a 10% 
chance that any storm giant will have enchanted weapons. 

A storm giant's natural Armor Class is 0, In battle, storm gi¬ 
ants usually wear elaborate bronze plate mail (AC -6). 


Habitat/Sorieiy: Storm giants are retiring and solitary but not 
shy They live in castles built on cloud islands (60%). mountain 
peaks (20%), or underwater (10%). They live quiet, reflective 
lives and spend their time musing about the world, composing 
and playing music, and tilling their land or gathering food. Land- 
and air-dwelHng storm giants usually are on good terms with 
neighboring silver dragons and good cloud giants, and cooperate 
with them for mutual defense. Aquatic storm giants have similar 
relationships with mermen and bronze dragons. 

When two or more storm giants are encountered in lair they 
will be a mated couple and their children. To determine each 
young giants maturity, roll ld4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant 
with no combat ability and hit points of ogre: rolls of ]-3 indicate 
older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to 
that of a cloud giant. 

There is a 20% chance that an adult storm giant is also a priest 
(70%) or priest/wizard (30%). Storm giants can attain 9th level 
as priests and 7th level as wizards. Storm giant priests can cast 
regular spells from the Animal, Charm, Combat, Creation, 
Guardian, Healing, Plant. Weather, and Sun spheres. Storm gi¬ 
ant wizards are generalists, and typically know spells from the 
Alteration, Invocation/Evocation, Con juration/Summoning, 
and Abjuration schools. 

Storm giant lairs are always protected by guards. Land or aer¬ 
ial lairs have 1-2 rocs (70%), which also serve a mounts, or 1-4 
griffons (30%). Underwater lairs have 2-8 (2d4) sea lions. 


Ecology: Sturm giants live off the land in the immediate vicinity of 
their lairs. Lf the natural harvest is not enough to sustain them, they 
create and carefully till large areas of gardens, fields, and vineyards. 
They do not keep animals for food, preferring to hunt.

Known as "human behemoths,' these human giants inhabit areas 
infested with hill giants and ogres. 

Verbeeg vary in height from ft 1 /a to 10 feet tall, and weigh be¬ 
tween 300 and 400 pounds They are unusually thin for their 
height, although this does not inhibit their fighting ability. Some 
have minor deformities, such as club foot, uneven eyes, hair lips, 
etc. In all other respects they appear human, including skin, hair, 
and eye color. They wear as much protective clothing and armor 
as they can obtain, which isn t much. Usually they wear furs and 
hides with pieces oi metal armor stitched into strategic places. 
They almost always carry shields and have the best weapons 
they can steal. Typically this means clubs and spears, 

Combat: Verbeeg are smart enough to let others soften up the 
enemy first. This does not mean that they are cowards, only self¬ 
ish and practical. Since they are commonly found with hill giants 
and ogres, in the first few rounds of combat verbeeg drive their 
less intelligent companions before them into battle. This is ac¬ 
companied by many curses, oaths, and highly descriptive ac¬ 
counts of the giants and ogres' parentage. 

Once the battle has begun, the verbeeg take on the stragglers 
and use their missile weapons, usually spears. The Strength of 
the giant determines how much further than normal the weapons 
can be hurled. Whatever their weaponry the verbeeg get a 
Strength bonus for damage. Each giant must have his Strength 
determined individually (or once for the whole group, at the 
DMs option) by rolling Id 10 and consulting the following table, 
Armor is always at leas! the equivalent of AC 4, and some Limes 
better, although never better than AC 1- 



chance), which also share their lair? 50% of the time ld6 verbeeg 
are with ld6 wolves or worgs (in polar climes winter wolves or 
polar bears); the rest of the time (20%) 1-2 of them are encoun¬ 
tered with a normal sized group of wandering monsters found in 
that area (DM must use reasonable judgment in this case). 

A verbeeg lair is usually an underground place, such as a cave 
or inside old ruins, There 5d6 of them can be found, an equal 
number of females (equal to males in combat), and 2d6 young. 
Half the young fight as bugbears, the other half fight as goblins. 
A lair usually includes 2d4 wolves (75% chance) or ld4 worgs 
(25% chance). In arctic climes substitute 1-2 polar bears for 
wolves, and 1-3 winter wolves for wargs. 

There is a 2% cumulative chance per giant of a shaman with 
the tribe. The verbeeg are jointly ruled by [he shaman (if there is 
one J and a warrior chieftain. The shaman can be up to 7th level. 
The warrior chieftain always has 18/00 Strength and no fewer 
than 40 hit points. The chieftain is responsible for all activities 
involving hunting, war and negotiations with strangers, The sha¬ 
man is responsible for all activities Inside the tribe, dispensing 
judgments concerning law and all magic. Any magical items in 
the tribe belong to the shaman; he has a 90 % chance of knowing 
how to use these. Most magical items that he does not under¬ 
stand are thrown into the tribal refuse heap before too long.

ogres and hill giants. These human behemoths are never found 
wandering alone. Thirty percent of wandering verbeeg encounb 
ers find ld6 of these giant-kin with Id4 hill giants or ogres (equal 


Ecology; Verbeeg eat almost anything, but they love flesh of all 
sorts. They maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with the 
giants and ogres that share their lair. The verbeeg provide the 
intelligence and direction that these giant types lack, and the gi¬ 
ants provide protection by their greater fighting prowess. To 
watch a group in action can be hilarious, so long as you are not 
their intended victim. Hill giants and ogres are too stupid to 
think much on their own. They tend to follow directions too lit¬ 
erally- This usually infuriates the verbeeg. They hop back and 
forth from foot to foot screaming insults at the befuddled giants 
that tower over them in height and size, as even the simplest in¬ 
structions are misinterpreted by these denser humanoids.

Wood giants (also known as voadkyn) are one of the smallest of 
the minor races of giants, looking somewhat like giant-sized 
wood elves. They are flighty, frivolous, and good friends with 
wood elves. 

Standing 9Va feet tali, wood giants weigh around 700 pounds. 
They have the physical proportions of humans, which makes 
them thin and light for giants. They are completely devoid of fa¬ 
cial and body hair, including eyebrows. Their heads seem overly 
large for their bodies, especially the jaws, chin, and mouth. Their 
ears are placed higher than on a human, almost completely 
above the line of the eyes. 

Wood giants can be almost any shade of brown, mixed with 
yellow or green. They are fond of leather armor and ring mail. A 
wood giant carries two weapons—a two-handed sword and a 
giant-sized long bow with quiver. A special sheath for the sword 
is steel tipped, enabling it to be used as a walking stick. This does 
not in any way disguise the sword. 

They wrap their ankles in leather strips almost up to the knee, 
although the foot itself is mostly bare. The only garments they 
wear are loose trousers or a short kilt. A wood giant always 
wears a leather forearm sheath to protect his arm from the bow¬ 
string, Ah of these items are frequently stained in forest colors of 
green and brown. 

Comb ah Voadkyn do not Bght unless forced to defend them¬ 
selves or allies. Their favorite weapon is their huge, non-magical 
long bow. They get a +1 bonus to attack rolls and 50% better 
range because of its unusual size, The matching arrows are over 
four feet long and cause ld8 points of damage. Wood giants do 
not hurl rocks or boulders. If pressed into melee, they wield their 
two-handed swords with one hand. 

When encountered, the Strength of the voadkyn must be deter¬ 
mined by rolling percentile dice. The resulting number is the IS 
(roll) value for their strength. This gives them a *3 to +6 
damage bonus, They do not receive any attack roll bonus for 
Strength. These giant-kin are usually in the company of ld4 
w'ood elves (60%), ld4 dire wolves (30%), or both (10%). 

Wood giants are 90% resistant to sleep and charm spells: they 
have infravision up to 90 feet. 

The only magical skill voadkyn have is the ability to poly¬ 
morph into any humanoid figure, from 3 to 15 teet in height. 
They cannot become a specific individual, only a typical speci¬ 
men of that race. They have been known to use this ability to join 



a party and trick it out of treasure. 

Wood giants can move silently in a forest, despite their great 
height, thus imposing a ^4 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. 
They can blend Into forest vegetation, becoming effectively in¬ 
visible, Only creatures able to detect invisible objects can see 
them. Although they are not Invisible while attacking, they are 
extremely quick (Dexterity 16) and can move out of hiding, 
launch an arrow, and move back into hiding in the same round. 
These arrows seem to come from nowhere unless the target is 
looking at the wood giants' hiding spot. 


Ha bi la ^Society: Wood giants inhabit the same forests as wood 
elves. They have no lairs, choosing to live under the stars or with 
the wood elves for a time. Wood giants encountered in the forest 
are mostly male (90%). Female wood giants usually remain at a 
makeshift camp or with the wood elves at their lair. Offspring are 
rare, as each female gives birth to only ld4 children in her life¬ 
time. The young are bom and raised deep in the woods among 
the wood elves, away from prying eyes. 

The strong bond between wood elves and wood giants goes 
back further than either race can remember. This may account 
tor the elven abilities of the giants. They do not mix or treat with 
any other intelligent creatures, although they tolerate any good 
elf. Like the elves, wood giants are fond of finely cut gems and 
well-crafted magical items. 

Humans w T ho have had contact with wood giants describe 
them as friendly enough, but flighty and frivolous, and never in a 
great hurry to do anything other than eat and drink large 
amounts of wine. Treants (with whom they occasionally con¬ 
verse) consider them irrational, foolish, and occasionally obnox¬ 
ious, but enjoyable company. 


Ecology: The jaw of the voadkyn is large because of the over¬ 
sized grinding teeth in it. These teeth are completely unsujted for 
eating meat, but they are perfect for vegetables and other plants. 
Wood giants can eat the leaves and roots of many plants that are 
inedible to humans. They especially enjoy nuts and seeds.

have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others 
with no hope of stopping their mass assault. And then, having 
come and killed, the gibberiings move on randomly back into the 
night. 

The first impression of gibberiings is of a writhing mass of fur 
and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is 
actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed 
canine ears, black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning 
faces. Their eyes are black and shine with a maniacal gleam. 
They carry short swords in their overly long arms as they lope 
ever faster forward. 

Combat: Gibberiings attack In great numbers, uttering ghastly 
howls, clicks, shrieks, and insane chattering noises which cause 
even the boldest hirelings to check morale each round. PCs need 
only make a morale check tf it is appropriate to their character. 
The screaming mob is completely disorganized in form, and ran¬ 
dom in direction. 

The gibberiings attack with common swords, but such is their 
skill and practice in using these weapons that they are +1 to hit. 
Their forward motion slows only long enough to kill anything 
moving, then continues forward, their bloodlust apparently un¬ 
abated. They always fight to the death. All food in their path is 
devoured, including the f allen among their own number, and any 
unfortified building or objects are generally wrecked, 

The only true hope of survival, should a herd of gibberiings be 
encountered, is to take strategic advantage of their fear and de¬ 
testation of bright light. The gibberiings generally frequent only 
dense forests and subterranean passages, loathing bright light of 
all kinds, and are particularly afraid of fire, Although their mass 
attacks would quickiy overwhelm someone wielding a torch, a 
bright bonfire or magical light of sufficient intensity will hold 
them at bay or deflect their path. 

Habitat Society: It is difficult to imagine a gibberling social struc¬ 
ture. It can be roughly compared to the social structure of lem¬ 
mings throwing themselves into the sea. or of a school of pirhana 
in a feeding frenzy. There is no sense, no organization. 



and no individuality. Though they dearly have a primitive 
means of communicating among themselves, they have no dis- 
cemable language, 

Gibberiings traveling above-ground invariably burrow into 
the ground to hide during the daytime, and it is at such time that 
they are most vulnerable. They can easily be tracked by the path 
of chaos and destruction they leave, and can be quickly dis- 
patched while they lie dormant just beneath the surface of the 
ground. If uncovered, they awake, but generally cower in fear at 
the bright light surrounding them, and so are easy prey. Subter¬ 
ranean gibberiings may burrow into the ground, or may simply 
He down in a curled, fetal posture at times of rest. They awake 
suddenly, as a group, and burst in unison out of the ground, 
howling and gibbering m a most frightful way. 

If captured, these strange creatures speak only their own in¬ 
comprehensible gibberish, and show neither the patience nor the 
inclination to learn other languages or communicate whatsoever 
with their captors. Instead, they beat against their cages and fling 
themselves at barred windows and doorways in pitiful attempts 
to escape their captivity. 

It is unclear how or when or even if gibberiings procreate. 

Ecology: Attempts to find the gibberiings' lairs have inevitably 
led back to subterranean passages, where the trail is eventually 
lost in the deepest rock-floored recesses of the caverns. 

Gibberiings require a prodigious amount of food to support 
their manic nocturnal existence, stripping to the bone anyone or 
anything that should fall in their path. Their fur is commonly 
infested with lice and other pests picked up during their bur¬ 
rowed slum her. Their hides are vile and worthless, Gibberiings 
carry no treasure or other useful items.Their swords are of the 
commonest variety, with no markings or decoration, and are of¬ 
ten pitted and dull. In short, gibberiings serve no purpose and no 
known master, save random death in the night.

The gift are a race of powerfully muscled mercenaries. They are 
civilized, though they lack mages among their own race. Giff hire 
on with various groups throughout the universe as mercenaries, 
bodyguards, enforcers, and general legbreakers. 

The giff is humanoid, with stocky flat, cylindrical legs and a 
humanoid torso, arms, and fingers. Its chest is broad and sup- 
ports a hippopotamus head with a natural helmet of flexible, chi- 
tinous plates. Giff come in colors ranging from black to gray to a 
rich gold, and many have colorful tattoos that leave their bodies 
a patchwork record of past victories, Giff speak their own lan¬ 
guage and the Common tongue. 



along the large plates. Armor repair is a major hobby among the 
gift- 

Finally, giff are somewhat magic resistant. They are deeply 
suspicious of magic, magicians, and magical devices. 


Combat: The giff are military-minded, and organize themselves 
into squads, platoons, companies, corps, and larger groups. The 
number of gill in a platoon varies according to the season, situa¬ 
tion, and level of danger involved. A gift "platoon ' hired to pro¬ 
tect a gambling operation may number two, while a platoon 
hired to invade an illithid stronghold may number well over a 
hundred. 

The gift pride themselves on their weapon skills, and any giff 
carries a number of swords, daggers, maces, and similar tools on 
hand to deal with troublemakers. 

A giff's true love in weaponry is the gun. Any giff has a 20% 
chance of having an arquebus and sufficient smoke powder for 
2d4 shots A misfiring weapon matters little to the giff (occasion¬ 
al fatalities are expected), the flash, noise, and damage is what 
most impresses them. 

Even unarmed, the giff are powerful opponents. They are as 
strong as a hill giant ( +7 damage adjustment for Strength), They 
will wade into a brawl just for the pure tun of it, tossing various 
combatants on both sides around to prove themselves the vic¬ 
tors. Once a weapon is bared, the giff consider all restrictions 
oft—the challenge is to the death. 

The top of the gift's head and snout are plated with thick, chi- 
tinous plates, flexible enough to permit motion, but giving the 
creature a natural helmet. The gift can charge using a head butt, 
inflicting 2d6 points ot damage. 

The giff prize themselves as mercenaries, and to that end have 
made elaborate suits of armor (AC 2). These include full helms 
with other monsters on the crests, inlaid with ivory and bone 


Habitai/Society: Gift of both sexes serve in their platoons, and 
both fight equally well. Giff young are raised tenderly until they 
are old enough to survive an exploding arquebus, then are in* 
ducted fully into the platoon. Every giff, male, female, and giftl- 
ing, has a rank within society, which can be changed only by 
someone of a higher rank. Within these ranks are sub-ranks and 
within those sub-ranks are color markings and badges. The 
highest-ranking giff gives the orders, the others obey. It does not 
matter if the orders are foolish or even suicidal—following them 
is the purpose of the giff in the universe, A quasi-mystical faith 
among the giff mercenaries confirms that all things have their 
place, and the gifts is to follow orders. 

Gift mercenaries are usually paid in smoke powder, though 
they often will accept other weapons and armor. It is purely a 
barter system, but to hire one giff for one standard week requires 
seven charges of smoke powder (one per day). 

Giff are fierce fighters, despite their somewhat comical appear¬ 
ance and mania for weapons. They will not. however, willingly 
fight other giff. If forced into such a situation on a battlefield, 
both groups retire for at least a day of drinking and sorting out 
ranks. There is a 10% chance that one platoon will join another 
in this case, but it is more likely that both will quit their current 
hiring and look for work elsewhere. 

Ecology; Giff live about 70 years, but do not age gracefully. As a 
gift grows older and begins to slow down, he is possessed with 
the idea of proving himself still young and vital, usually in battle. 
As a result, there are very, very few* old giff.

The gith are a race ot grotesque humanoids that appear to be a 
peculiar mixture of elf and reptile. They are extremely gaunt and 
lanky with long gangling arms and spindly legs. Their hands 
have three fingers with no opposable thumbs, yet they are able to 
use tools and wield weapons. Their fingers and toes end in sharp 
daws. If one could get a gith to stand up straight, he would mea¬ 
sure dose to 7 feet talk However most gith appear to be no more 
than 5 feet tall, for they always stand hunched over at the shoul¬ 
ders. in a permanent slouch. 

Combat: It possible, the gith attack in mass, usually starting with 
a psionie attack by one of their leaders. Then the entire party 
charges quickly into melee. Their main charge is often accom¬ 
plished by springing up to 20 feet in one giant leap to close with 
their enemies. When they employ this spring, it gives them a +2 
THACO bonus on the first round of combat. 

The gith are usually armed with large, wicked-looking spears 
that have giant, razor-sharp heads of polished obsidian (ld6-l 
damage). Although these spears look like thrusting weapons, 
they are used primarily to slash or chop, The gith often armor 
themselves, and especially their vulnerable backs, with inix-shell 
armor (AC t&gt;) of their own manufacture*

Gith have the following psionie powers: 

• Telepathy—Sciences: tower of iron will, project force. Devo¬ 
tions: id insinuation, mind thrust, contact, mind blank, mental 
barrier. 

• Psychokinesis—Sciences; telekinesis. Devotions: animate ob¬ 
ject, animate shadow, ballistic attack, control body control

Note: Only leaders commanding 25 or more gith have psionie 
powers. The psionics listed above are representative of these 
leaders, but their powers do vary greatly Gith with more Hit 
Dice have correspondingly greater powers. 



Habitat Society: The gith live in tribal organizations. The indi¬ 
vidual with the most powerful psionics generally acts as the lead¬ 
er* All other social positions are distributed at his pleasure. 

For every twenty-five gith. there will be a 5 HD leader, for eve¬ 
ry fifty a 6 HD leader, and for every tribe of 100 or more a 7 HD 
leader. In addition to having hit points and THACO numbers ap¬ 
propriate to their HD, these leaders will have psionie powers ap¬ 
proximately equal to a psionirist of an equivalent level. 

Some of these leaders are priests. While little is known of the 
gith religion, shamans up to the 4th level are known to accompa¬ 
ny and sometimes lead gith tribes. There have also been reports 
of gith wizards (defilers) ranked at the 6th level. Even if true. 6th 
level would be unusual for gith. but wizards of up to 4th level 
have been reported by reliable witnesses. 

Not much is known about the reproductive cycle of the gith. It 
is known that they are egg layers; females lay approximately ld6 
eggs in a clutch. It is rumored that the gith operate hatcheries 
containing hundreds (some say thousands) of nests. 

Ecology: Mountain gith live in underground lairs, claiming a par¬ 
ticular canyon or valley as their territory. Gith inhabiting table¬ 
lands tend to organize their society more along the lines of a 
nomadic hunting clan, going wherever the game takes them. 
They do not hesitate to attack human or demihuman groups, for 
they view humans and demihumans as a choice food supply, pre¬ 
ferring it over other flesh. They will even attack thri-kreen, if 
they are hungry enough, but the msectoids taste bad. and usually 
escape gith raiders.

When the githyanki. under their liberator, Gith, freed themselves 
from the yoke of mindflayer slavery this branch of the race fled 
not to the Astral plane, but to arcane space. 

Tall, emaciated beings, the pirates of Gith appear as almost 
skeletal humanoids with skin varying from dirty gray to dull yeh 
low. Long, dingy-brown hair flows down their backs and over 
the ornate, bejeweled arms and armor they prefer to use. 

Combat: The pirates of Gith can operate as fighters, mages, or 
fighter mages, with limits of 11 in each class. Typically the 
highest-level fighter captains the ship. This frees all the mages 
(single-and mukidassed) for spelljammmg or combat duty. 

Clerics of Gith are occasionally encountered as well (limit of 
11 th level). Rarely, a fighter/ cleric is encountered, almost always 
as the captain of its ship. 

When dosing with a foe. the pirates use spells and any arma¬ 
ment their ship possesses. In melee, they use a variety of weap¬ 
ons, with swords predominating. 

Operating from small bases hidden on asteroids, the pirates 
Strive to capture any ship that is larger, faster, or better armed 
than theirs. They feverishly attempt to capture any elven-made 
ships that come their way (see below). As a result, many elven 
armadas post large bounties on the heads of Gith pirates. 

The pirates' greatest fury is reserved for the illithids, however. 
The pirates- of Gith spare no expense to kill all mindflayers they 
find, No Gith pirate ever uses a captured illithid ship, 

A ship's complement varies, but these numbers are a general 
guideline: 

1 Captain (highest-level fighter or fighter/cleric) 

1 Mate (highest-level fighter ; mage or cleric) 

I Chief Spell jammer or Warlock (highest-level mage) 

The rest of the crew is evenly divided among the three common 
class possibilities. 



the pecking order in a settlement. This explains the pirates' con¬ 
stant quest for better ships. Each settlement is ruled by force by 
its best ship, or a coalition of the best ships. 

Extreme isolationists, the pirates of Gith live with no other 
races—they may even try to commit genocide on a race that set¬ 
tles too close to them. Over all despite being pirates, these Gith 
live a structured, militaristic lifestyle. 

Every adult member of this race possesses the following magi¬ 
cal abilities, each usable three times a day: astral spell plane 
shift, and ESP. All function as the spell of the same name (as cast 
by the lowest-level caster possible). These inherent abilities also 
enable the pirates to pilot ships with series helms. These abilities 
function only in wildspace. not in the phlogiston. 

The most dangerous aspect of this race is the combination of 
the above abilities, the properties of major and minor spelljam¬ 
ming helms, and the unique organic structure of the elven-made 
ships. When a Gith pirate is at the helm of an elven-made ship 
(flitter, etc, ), he may use his plane shift and astral spell abilities to 
shunt the entire ship, and all its contents, to the Astral plane (this 
uses up that pirate's astral spell and plane shift abilities for the 
day). This gives the pirates an escape route, and it enables them 
to wait in known shipping lanes, astrally hidden, before return¬ 
ing to the Prime Material plane to launch an attack. The Gith 
pirates can use only elven-made ships of less than 50 tons in this 
manner. 

This special maneuver only works in wtldspace, not in the 
phlogiston. That is certainly the reason the Gith pirates never 
pursue prey into that medium. 


Habitat Society: The pirate philosophy carries over into all as¬ 
pects of life. The strongest take what they want. Each ship is very 
important to Its crew, as it is the primary factor in determining 


Ecology? The Gith pirates are carnivores, pure and simple. They 
do not care what state, short of putrefied, the meat is in. Some of 
the pirate bands also engage in cannibalism.

Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They 
dwell upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to 
make war on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with 
the githzerai. 

Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are ap¬ 
proximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt 
and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming 
black eyes that instantly betray their mhumanness. Like many 
demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated 
at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. 
Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with 
feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems. 

Githyanki speak their own tongue, and no others. 


Combat: The githyanki have had long years to perfect the art ol 
war. Their very existence attests to their battle prowess. Each in¬ 
dividual githyanki has a character class and level from which are 
derived such things as THACO, armor class, spell use, etc.

The armor for each githyanki varies according to class. Mages 
and illusionists have AC 10. Fighters and fighter mages have dif¬ 
fering armor—AC 5 to AC 0 (6 - ld6). Knights have AC 0. 

Githyanki have Hit Dice according to their class and level, and 
their hit points are rolled normally. Their THACO is determined 
per dass and level, as w T elh Fighters, fighter/mages, and knights 
may receive more than one attack per round—other githyanki 
have one attack per round. 

Githyanki knights are evil champions who take up the causes 



of the githyankis mysterious lich-queen, Githyanki knights are 
very powerful and highly revered in their society. Githyanki 
knights have all of the powers and abilities of a human paladin 
except these are turned toward evil ie,g. detect good instead of 
detect evil, command undead instead of turning undeai etc,), 

Githyanki mages, fighter/mages, and illusionists will receive 
all the spells available at their level of experience, Spells should 
be determined randomly keeping in mind that they are by nature 
creatures of destruction—offensive spells should be favored. 

The githyanki soldiers use arms and armor similar to humans, 
however these are normally highly decorated and have become 
almost religious artifacts. A githyanki would likely show greater 
care for his weapons and armor than he would toward his mate. 
Half of the githyanki fighters, fighter/mages, or knights that 
progress to 5th level receive a magical two-handed sword +1, 
the remainder using normal two-handed swords, Githyanki 
fighters of 7th level and above are 60% likely to carry a fang 
smord *2. Knights of 7th level and above will always carry a 
silver sword —a tiuo -handed sword +3 that, if used astrally has 
a 5% chance per hit of cutting an opponent's silver cord (see The 
Astral Plane, DMG page 132), but mind barred individuals are 
immune, A supreme leader of a lair will carry a special silver 
sword that is +5 with all the abilities of a vorpal that 

also affects mind barred individuals. 

Githyanki will never willingly allow a silver sword to fall into 
the hands of a nongithyankL If a special si/oer sword should fall 
into someone's hands, very powerful raiding parties will be 
formed to recover the sword. Failure to recover one of these 
highly prized weapons surely means instant death to all the gith¬ 
yanki involved at the hands of their merciless lich-queen. 

All githyanki have the natural ability to plane shift at will. 
They will rarely travel anywhere besides back and forth from the 
Astral plane to the Prime Material plane. 

Habitat Society: History provides some information on the 
githyanki—their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe 


155 









Githyanki 


they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to 
serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human 
slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward 
the diithids. For centuries these humans increased their hatred 
but could not summon the strength necessary to break tree. So 
they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, 
waking for an opportunity strike out against their masters. 
Finally a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer 
by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against 
their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but even¬ 
tually the people freed themselves. They had earned their free¬ 
dom and become the githyanki, ( which, in their tongue, means 
sons of Gith), 

These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human 
would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has pro¬ 
gressed beyond the 13 th level of experience and very few prog¬ 
ress beyond Pth. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is 
tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in 
one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obvi¬ 
ously results in death, Githyanki that reach 12 th level of experi¬ 
ence are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the 
presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed 
the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess, 

Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These or¬ 
nately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the 
Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospita¬ 
ble to strangers. 

A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This 
leader will be a fighter mage of lOth 8th level or 11th 9th level. 
The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with 
the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical 
leader will be equipped with 2-8 random magical items in addi¬ 
tion to the weapons described above. 

All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as 
the supreme leaders elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. 
There will also be up to l r 000 githyanki of lesser status. 

Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel 
to the Prime Material plane These treks across the planes often 
lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface 
raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind 
flayers. Outside the war with the githxerai, these raids are con¬ 
ducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill. 

A typical githyanki lair on the Prime Material plane will con¬ 
tain the followings

On the Prime Material plane, githyanki have a pact with a 
group of red dragons. These proud creatures will act as mounts 
and companions to the githyanki- When encountered on the 
Prime Material plane and outside their lair, a githyanki group 
will typically consist of the following: 


One captain 6th-level fighter 

One warlock 4th to 7th~level mage 

Five lower 

githyankis fighters of lst-3rd level 

Such a group will have two red dragons as steeds, transporting 
between four and six githyanki per dragon. The dragons will 
fight for the safety and well-being of the githyanki but will not 
directly risk their lives, fleeing when the battle is turned against 
them. Just what the githyanki offer the red dragons in return for 
these services is unknown. 

An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond 
between military leaders and their subordinates, This bond al¬ 
lows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands 
(to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting 
messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee 
round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and 
allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly. 

Ecology: Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. 
However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of envi¬ 
ronments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups 
are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are 
unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved. 

G'lathk: The g'lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in 
human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barren¬ 
ness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in 
vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and 
other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The glathk are 
also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic 
water-gardens. 

Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and 
self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magi¬ 
cal talents in the field of architecture and construction, The mlar 
are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward de¬ 
signing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day- 
to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their 
jobs into an art form. 

HrVtknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies mov¬ 
ing through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, 
such as heat and light, Others are not so easily observed. There 
are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans gener¬ 
ally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, 
the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them 
too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are 
similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to per¬ 
form their crafts* 

More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They 
will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the 
joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of en¬ 
slavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those 
weaker than themselves. 

Unlike humans, though, the githyanki never war amongst 
themselves. The split of the githyanki and the githzerai (q,o.) is 
the closest thing the gith races have known to civil war. Githy- 
anki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith socie¬ 
ty and is never broken* This, too, may be an effect of the race's 
enslavement.

Githzerai are the monastic, chaotic neutral counterparts to the 
githvanki iq.v. h The two races share a stretch of time in history; 
the githzerai are the lesser and more repressed offshoot of the 
original people that the warrior Gith helped to escape the slavery 
of the mind flayers millennia ago. 

Githzerai are very similar in appearance to their githyanki 
cousins, although they tend to look much more human. Their 
features are for the most part unremarkable, with vaguely noble 
countenance. Their skin tone is that of human Caucasian flesh. 
Githzerai dress simply, wearing functional clothing and favoring 
conservafive tones. 


Combat The githzerai are unadorned and ruthlessly straightfor¬ 
ward with their combat and magic. Their strong resistance to magic 
seems to make up for their generally inferior fighting ability.

The armor for each githzerai varies according to class. Mages 
have AC 10. Fighters and fighter mages have differing armor— 
AC 5 to AC 0 (6 —Idfr). Thieves have AC 7. 

Githzerai have Hit Dice according to their class and level, and 
their hit points are rolled normally, Their THACO is determined 
per class and level, as well. Fighters and fighter/mages may re¬ 
ceive more than one attack per round—other githzerai have one 
attack per round. 

On rare occasions, a githzerai will progress as a thief. These 
thieves seem to have some significance to the strange githzerai 



religion. Although they are never known to become leaders in 
any capacity these thieves are an exception to the maximum 
level of 9th, often progressing up to 12th level of experience. Just 
what role these thieves play is unknown. 

Githzerai fighters of at least 5th level have use of silver swords. 
These magical weapons are two-handedsivonb + 3 that, if used 
in the Astral plane, have a 5% chance of cutting an opponent's 
silver cord upon scoring a hit (see The Astral Plane, DMG. page 
132), though mind barred individuals are immune. These weap¬ 
ons are of powerful religious value to the githzerai and they will 
never willingly allow them to fall into the hands of outsiders. If 
this happens, the githzerai will go to great ends to recover the 
weapon. 

All githzerai have the innate power to plane shift to any plane. 
This is rarely done except to travel back and forth to the Prime 
Material plane where the githzerai have several fortresses. 

Habitat/Society: The githzerai were originally offspring of a race 
of humans that were freed from slavery under mind flayers by a 
great female warrior named Gith. These men and women did 
not, however, choose to follow Giths ways after they revolted 
against their slavers. Instead, they fell sway to the teachings of a 
powerful wizard who proclaimed himself king—and later, god— 
of the people. The githzerai then separated themselves from the 
githyanki, beginning a great racial war that has endured the long 
millennia without diminishing. 

Githzerai can progress as fighters, mages, or fighter mages, 
and thieves. They will rarely attain levels above 7th and, in any 
case, will never progress beyond 9th, The githzerai, who worship 
a powerful and ancient wizard as though he were a god (he is 
not), are destroyed before they have enough power to become a 
threat to their ruler 

If encountered outside of their lair, githzerai will usually be in 
the following numbers;

One captain 

Two warlocks 
Three sergeants 
Three 'zerths’

three possible classes and of 1st- 
3rd level 


A thief, ii present (10% chance); wiJI replace one of the lower 
level githzerai and will be of 6th* 10th level. 

The githzerai dwell primarily on the plane of Umbo. They 
have mighty fortresses in that plane of chaos and their position 
there ts very strong. Typically one of these fortresses contains 
approximately 3,000 githzerai led by a single supreme leader. 
This leader has absolute control over the githzerai; including the 
powers of life and death. 

The githzerai hold only a few fortresses on the Prime Material 
plane, but these are particularly strong holdings, with walls of 
adamantite rising as huge squat towers trom dusty plains. Each 
houses approximately 500 githzerai, including a supreme leaden 

On Limbo, however, the githzerai presence is very strong. Liv¬ 
ing in cities typically of 100,000 or more, the gi thzerai enjoy total 
power over themselves on an otherwise chaotic and unpredicta¬ 
ble plane. One notable example of this is the city Shra'fcf lor. This 
large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai 
living in great power. Shra'kf lor serves as both a capital and as a 
headquarters for all githzerai military matters. The greatest gen¬ 
erals and nobles of the race meet here to plan githzerai strategy 
for battling both the githyanki and the mind flayers. There is 
likely no force on Limbo that could readily threaten the power of 
Shra'ktlor or its many inhabitants. 

Gne of the prime motivations among the githzerai is their war 
with the githyanki. These offshoots of Gith s original race are ob¬ 
sessed with this war of extermination. They often employ merce¬ 
naries on the Prime Material plane to aid them in battling the 
githyanki The evil, destructive nature of the githyanki makes 
the hiring of mercenaries to right them a relatively simple task. 


Legend of the Zerthimon: In githzerai lore there is a central fig¬ 
ure that is revered above all others—Zerthimon, The githyanki 
believe him to be a great god that was once a man. According to 
githzerai lore, when the original race broke free of the mind flay¬ 
ers. it was Zerthimon that opposed Gith, claiming that she was 
hateful and unfit to lead the people. 

There ensued a great battle and the people were polarized by 
the two powers. Those that chose to support Gith became the 
githyanki. Those that supported Zerthimon became the githze- 
rai, 

Zerthimon died in the battle, but in his sacrifice he freed the 
githzerai from Gith. The githzerai believe that someday Zerthi¬ 
mon, in his new godly form, will return and take the them to a 
place on another plane. 

Zerths are special among the githzerai. acting as focal points 
for the attention of Zerthimon. The githzerai believe that when 
Zerthimon returns for them, he will first gather all of the zerths 
and lead them to their new paradise. It might be said that the 
zerths are the center of githzerai religion. Unfortunately, they are 
not free from religious persecution. 


The wizard-king (whose name is not known) that rules over 
the highly superstitious githzerai would like very much to stamp 
ouL the legend of Zerthimon. The wizard-king believes that this 
legend challenges his authority and very likely it does. However, 
he has never been able to rid the githzerai of this legend and he is 
now forced to tolerate it. 

Rrakkma bands: Although the githzerai are not a bitter or 
overly violent race, they still tend to hold a strong enmity and 
hatred for the race of illithids that originally enslaved the gith 
race so many thousands of years ago. By human terms, that may 
be a very long time to hold a grudge, but the githzerai see the 
mind flayers as the cause of the split of the Gith race and much of 
the hardships the githzerai are forced to endure. Thus large 
rrakkma {in the githzerai tongue) bands are often formed to hunt 
mind flayers. These bands typically consist of 30-60 githzerai 
warriors led by the githzerai equivalent of a sergeant. For rough¬ 
ly three months, these bands will roam the outer and inner 
planes, searching for groups of illithids and destroying them ut¬ 
terly. The rrakkma bands are very popular in githzerai society 
and it is considered to be an honor to serve in one. 

The githzerai fortresses on the Prime Material plane tend to be 
very large affairs with great, impenetrable walls. Wherever these 
fortresses stand, they destroy the landscape for miles. No plants 
or animals live within many miles of the fortresses and the land is 
reduced to wasteland around them. It is not known if the effect is 
just the land's reaction to the *'other-planar'' stuff of which the 
castles are constructed, or if githzerai mages magically produce 
the effect in order to keep material beings away from these for¬ 
tresses. 

The most likely purpose of these fortresses cm the Prime Mate¬ 
rial plane is to keep tabs on the githyanki . The githzerai, not be¬ 
ing a particularly war-mongering or violent race, have no desire 
to conquer the Prime Material plane like the githyanki do. How¬ 
ever, the githzerai realize that if their enemies have a strong hold 
on the Prime Material plane, they will become more powerful 
and thus will hold power over them. The githzerai carefully mon¬ 
itor the progress on the githyanki and lead coordinated, focused 
strikes against strongpomts of the githyanki, thus hampering 
their ability to expand and grow in the Prime Material plane. 

During these attacks, the githzerai will not intentionally attack 
the natural denizens of the Prime Material plane (humans, demi- 
humans, humanoids, etc.), but they will never sacrifice a well- 
planned attack on the githyanki just to preserve life. With the 
githzerai, the ends will always justify the means. 

Like the githyanki, the githzerai really have no part m the 
Blood War ) of the fiends. They seldom venture to the lower 
planes, and only then for matters of absolute importance. The 
githzerai find the bloodthirsty destructive nature of the fiends to 
be distasteful, so they will typically not deal with those creatures 
for any reason. They coexist with the sbadl, and githzerai are 
rumored to have mental powers beyond those described here. 

Ecology: For as long as men have known of the ability to travel 
the planes, they have wondered at the natural power of the 
githzerai to wander from plane to plane at will. Although man 
and githzerai are not natural enemies, battles are frequently 
fought between the two races, due in part to some humans desire 
to capture a live githzerai for study. To date, no such creature has 
been secured,

The creature commonly called the gloomwing is the adult stage 
of the tenebrous worm (see below). These huge moths are native 
to the demi-plane of Shadow, Their bodies and wings are cov- 
ered with shimmering, geometric patterns of black and silver. 
They have large, fern-like black antennae tipped with white and 
eight legs each ending in a pearly daw. 

Combat: A gloomwings shimmering markings make it a difficult 
target. Any creature viewing the moth squarely from above or 
below must success!ully save vs, spells or be confused , as the 4th- 
level mage spell, for 5-8 (ld4 +4) rounds. The markings also pro¬ 
vide excellent camouflage, and the moth is 50% undetectable in 
darkness, twilight, or moonlight. Successfully camouflaged 
gloomwings cannot cause confusion - 

When attacking in darkness or near darkness, a gloomwing re- 
ceives a -2 bonus to its surprise roll Gloom wings normally 
swoop to the attack This gives them a + 2 attack bonus and 
allows them to seize and carry away victims less than 3 feet tall 
and that weigh less than 62 pounds. Such victims are securely 
held in the moth's eight claws w hile the moth attacks each round 
with a + 4 attack bonus and a + 2 bonus to damage. When fight¬ 
ing creatures too large to carry away, the moth hovers, biting and 
flailing with its two front claws. 

During the second and each successive round of combat, the 
moth emits a potent pheromone that can attract other 
gloomwings and can cause weakness in any non-insect. The 
weakness effect has a 25-toot radius and exposed creatures must 
successfully save vs poison or lose 1 point of Strength each 
round they remain in the area of effect. Creatures who are suc¬ 
cessful with their initial save need not save again if exposure con¬ 
tinues, Multiple gloomwings do not require multiple saves. Lost 
Strength points are recovered at the rate of 1 per turn, beginning 
ld4 hours after exposure stops. Creatures reduced to 0 Strength 
lose consciousness until they regain at least 1 point of Strength. 

There is a 20% chance each round that an additional Id4 
gloomwings will arrive at the end of any round when one or 
more gloomwings are emitting this strong scent. If they do ar¬ 
rive, they will join in combating any opponents. 



Habitat/Society: Gloom wing moths arc short-lived, solitary' 
hunters. They use a variety of pheromones to ward off ri vals and 
to find mates. They form groups, but only to attack large prey, 
and then only when drawn to the fray by the combat phero¬ 
mone. When two gloomwings of the same sex meet they flee un¬ 
less there is combat pheromone in the air. 

Ecology: Gloomwing moths live only 4-9 (ld6 + 3) weeks, During 
this time they search for mates and eat voraciously. Egg-laden 
females fVz chance) use corpses of small sized or larger creatures 
as incubators tor their eggs. The eggs hatch in 12 days, sprouting 
ld6 + 4 small tenebrous worms. The corpse cannot be resurrected 
unless the infestation is removed with a cure disease spell first. 
Unless killed, the young worms completely devour the body 
when they emerge. 

Tenebrous Worm 

These natives of the demi-plane of Shadow resemble giant cater¬ 
pillars. In combat, they strike with powerful mandibles and any¬ 
one bitten by the worm must roll a successful saving throw vs. 
poison, with a penalty, or suffer double damage from the tox¬ 
ic bite. The head and upper body are covered with poisonous 
bristles that inflict ld4 points of damage to anyone whose bare 
skin comes into contact with them. A successful saving throw vs. 
poison is required to avoid paralysis for ld4 rounds after con¬ 
tact. At the end of that time, the victim dies unless a neutralize 
poison or s/ou? potsoii spell is administered. The chance of at¬ 
tackers being hit by the spines is equal to 10% times their base 
Armor Class (before shield and Dexterity modifiers). Attacking 
the worm's head reduces the chance of contact by 20% (but only 
one character can attack the head at a time). The mandibles of 
this worm are attractive and worth from 1,000 to 3,000gold piec¬ 
es per set.

Gnolls are large, evil p hyena-like humanoids that roam about in 
loosely organized bands. 

While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, 
the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and 
have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human. 
They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a 
short reddish gray to dull yellow mane, 

Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the 
tongues ol llinds, trolls, ores, or hobgoblins. 

Combat? Gnolls seek to overwhelm their opponents by sheer 
numbers, using horde tactics. When under the direction of fluids 
or a strong leader, they can be made to hold rank and fight as a 
unit. While they do not often lay traps, they will ambush or at¬ 
tempt to attack from a flank or rear position. Gnolls favor 
swords (15%), pole arms (35%) and battle axes 120%) in combat, 
but also use bows (15%), momingstars (15%). 

HabitatSociety: Gnolls are most often encountered under¬ 
ground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they op¬ 
erate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest, 
using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will 
have (30% chance) 1-3 trolls as guards and servants. Above 
ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4-16 hyenas 
(80%) or 2-12 hyaenodons ( 20 %) which can act as guards, 

A gnoll lair will contain between 20 and 200 adult males. For 
every 20 gnolls, there will be a 3 Hit Die leaden if 1 00 or more are 
encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 4 Hit Dice, an 
Armor Class of 3 , and who receives a +3 on his damage rolls due 
to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by 
2-12 ( 2 d 6 l elite warrior guards of 3 Hit Dice (AC 4, +2 damage). 

In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of 
males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually 



as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many 
young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight, Gnolls 
always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and 
may have many more. 

Gnolls will work together with ores, hobgoblins, bugbears, 
ogres, and trolls, U encountered as a group, there must be a rela¬ 
tive equality of strength. Otherwise the gnolls will kill and eat 
their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be 
killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants, 
humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor. 

Ecology: Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelli¬ 
gent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will 
completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take sev¬ 
eral years for the game to return, When allowed to die of old age, 
the typical gnoll lives to be about 35 years old. 

Hind 

The flind is similar to a gnoll in body style, though it is a little 
shorter, and broader. They are more muscular than their cousins. 
Short, dirty, brown and red fur covers their body. Their fore¬ 
heads do not slope back as far, and their ears are rounded, but 
still animat like. 

Rinds use dubs (75%) which inflict 1-6 points of damage and 
flindbars (25%) which do 1-4 points of damage. A flindbar is a 
pair of chain-linked iron bars which are spun at great speed. A 
flind with a flindbar can strike twice per round. Each successful 
hit requires the victim to save vs + wands or have his weapon en¬ 
tangled in the chain and torn from his grasp by the flindbar. Due 
to their great strength, Hinds get a +1 on their attack rolls. 

Flinds are regarded with reverence and awe by gnolls. Flind 
leaders are 3 + 3 Hit Dice, at least 13 intelligence and 18 charisma 
to gnolls (15 to flinds), and always use flindbars.

Small cousins of the dwarves, gnomes are friendly but reticent, 
quick to help their friends but rarely seen by other races unless 
they want to be They tend to dwell underground in hilly wood¬ 
ed regions where they can pursue their interests in peace. 
Gnomes can be fighters or priests, but most prefer to become 
thieves or illusionists instead. Multi-class characters are more 
common among the gnomes than any other demihuman race. 

Gnomes strongly resemble small thin, nimble dwarves, with 
the exception of two notable facial features: gnomes prefer to 
keep their beards short and stylishly-trimmed, and they take 
pride in their enormous noses (often fully twice the size of any 
dwarf or human's). Skin. hair, and eye color vary somewhat by 
subrace: the most common type of gnome, the Rock Gnome, has 
skin ranging from a dark tan to a woody brown (sometimes with 
a hint of gray), pale hair, and eyes any shade of blue. Gnomish 
clothing lends toward leather and earth tones, brightened by a 
bit of intricately wrought jewelry or stitching. Rock gnomes have 
an average life span of around 450 years, although some live to 
be 600 years or more. 

Gnomes speak their own language, and each subrace has its 
own distinctive dialect. Many gnomes learn the tongues of hu¬ 
mans. kobolds, goblins, halflings, and dwarves in order to com¬ 
municate with their neighbors, and some Rock Gnomes are able 
to communicate with burrowing mammals via a basic language 
of grunts, snorts, and signs. 

Gnomes posses infravision to 60 feet, and the ability to detect 
sloping passages (1-5 on ld6) r unsate stonework (1-7 on IdlO), 
and approximate depth (1-4 on ld6) and direction (1-3 on ld6) 
underground. They are highly resistant to magic, gaining a +1 
bonus to their saving throws for each 5.5 points of Constitution 
{a typical gnome will have a bonus oi + 3 to + 4). Unfortunately, 
Lhis also means that there is a 20% chance that any magical item 
a gnome attempts to use will malfunction (armor, weapons, and 
illusionary items exempted). 

Combat: Gnomes prefer the use of strategy over brute force in 
combat and will often use illusions in imaginative ways to even 
the odds. Their great hatred of kobolds and goblins, their tradi¬ 
tional enemies, gives them a +1 on their attack rolls when fight¬ 
ing these beings. They are adept at dodging the attacks of large 


opponents, forcing all giant class creatures (gnoils, bugbears, 
ogres, trolls, giants, etc.) to subtract 4 from their attack rolls 
when fighting gnomes. 

Gnomes can use any weapon that matches their size and often 
carry a second (or even a third) weapon as a back-up* Short 
sw r ords, hammers, and spears are favorite melee weapons* with 
short bows, crossbows, slings, and darts coming into play when 
distance weapons are called for: virtually every gnome will also 
carry a sharp knife somewhere on his or her person as a final line 
of defense. 

A typical rock gnome will wear studded leather armor and use 
a small shield (AC 6). Their leaders will have chain mail (AC 4). 
and any gnome above 5th level has plate mail (AC 2). There is a 
10% chance for each level above 5th that the gnomes armor 
and/or weapon is magical (roU separately for each). Spell casters 
have a 10% chance per level of having 1-3 magical items usable 
by their character class. 

Habitat Society: Gnomes live In underground burrows in remote 
hilly, wooded regions. They are clannish, with friendly rivalries 
occurring between neighboring clans. They spend their lives min¬ 
ing, crafting fine jewelry, and enjoying the fruits of their labors. 
Gnomes work hard, and they play hard. They observe many fes¬ 
tivals and holidays, which usually involve games, nose measur¬ 
ing contests, and swapping of grand tales. Their society is well 
organized, with many levels of responsibility, culminating in a 
single chief who is advised by clerics in matters directly relating 
to their calling. 

A gnomish lair is home to some 40-400 (4d!0 * 10) gnomes, 
one-quarter of them children. For every 40 adults there is a fight¬ 
er of 2nd to 4th level If 160 or more are encountered there is also 
a Sth-ievd chief and a 3rd-Ievel lieutenant, if 200 or more are 
met, there is a cleric or illusionist of 4th to 6th level If 320 or 
more are present, add a 6th-leve! fighter, two 5th-level fighters, a 
7th-!evel cleric, four 3rd-level clerics, a 5th-level illusionist, and 
two 2nd-level illusionists. Gnomes often befriend burrowing 
mammals, so 5d6 badgers (70%), 3d4 giant badgers (20%), or 
2d4 wolverines (10%) will be present as well These animals are 
neither pets nor servants, but allies who will help guard the clan.

Gnome 


Ecology: Gnomes are very much a magical part of nature, exist¬ 
ing in harmony with the land they inhabit. They choose to live 
underground but remain near the surface in order to enjov its 
beauty. 

Svirfneblin (Deep Gnome* 

Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep 
Gnomes. Small parties of these demlhumans roam the Underdark's 
maies of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said 
to dwell in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tun¬ 
nels, buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these di¬ 
minutive creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden dties 
secret in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa. 
Drew, and mind flayers. 

Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their 
thin, wiry gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock- 
colored, usually medium brown to brownish gray and their eyes 
are gray. Male svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep 
gnomes have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin life span 
is 250 years, 

Svirfneblin mining teams and patrols work together so 
smoothly that to outside observers they appear to communicate 
with each other by some form of racial empathy. They speak 
their own dialect of gnomish that other gnomish subraces are 
60% likely to understand. Most deep gnomes are also able to 
converse in Underworld Common and speak and understand a 
fair amount of kuo-toan and drow. These small folk can also 
converse with any creature from the elemental plane of Earth via 
a curious language' consisting solely of vibrations (each pitch 
conveys a different message3. although only on a very basic 
level. 

All svirfneblin have the innate ability to cast blindness, blur t 
and change self once per day Deep gnomes also radiate non¬ 
detection identical to the spell of the same name. Deep gnomes 
have 120-foot infravision, as well as all the detection abilities of 
rock gnomes. 

Combat: Despite their metal armor and arms, these quick, small 
folk are able to move very quietly Deep gnomes are able to 
'freeze in place for long periods without any hint of movement, 
making them 60% unlikely to be seen by any observer, even 
those with in fra vision. They are surprised only on a roll of 1 on 
IdlOdue to their keen hearing and smelling abilities and surprise 
opponents 90% of the time. 

The deep gnomes w-ear leather jacks sewn with rings or scales 
of mithral steel alloy over fine chainmad shirts, giving a typical 
svirfneblin warrior an Armor Class of 2. They do not usually 
carry shields, since these w p ould hinder movement through the 
narrow 1 corridors they favor. For every level above 3rd, a Deep 
Gnome's Armor Class improves by one point—-a 4th-Ievel deep 
gnome has AC X, a 5th-level deep gnome, AC 0; to a maximum 
of AC 6. 

All deep gnomes are 20% magic resistant, gaining an extra 
+ 5% magic resistance for each level they attain above 3rd. They 
are immune to illusions, phantasms, and hallucinations. Because 
of their high wisdom speed, and agility they make aH saving 
throws at +3, except against poison, when their bonus is +2. 

Deep Gnomes are typically armed with a pick and a dagger 
which, while nonmagical, gain a +1 bonus to attacks and dam¬ 
age due to their finely-honed edges. Svirfneblin also carry ld4 + 6 
special stun dnrfs, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 
bonus to hit. Each dart releases a small puff of gas when it strikes; 
any creature inhaling the gas must save vs. poison or bosrimned 
for 1 round and stowed for the next four rounds. Elite warriors 
(3rd level and above) often carry hollow darts with acid Inside 



( + 2cl4 to damage) and crystal caltrops which, when stepped on r 
release a powerful steep gas. 

Habitat Society: Svirfneblin society is strictly divided between 
the sexes; females are in charge of food production and running 
the city while males patrol its borders and mine for precious 
stones. A svirfneblin city will have both a king and a queen, each 
of whom is independent and has his or her own sphere of respon* 
sibility. Since only males ever leave the city, the vast majority of 
encounters will be with deep gnome mining parties seeking for 
new lodes. For every four svirfneblin encountered, there will be 
an overseer with 4 + 7 Hit Dice, Groups of more than 20 will be 
led by a burrow warden 16 + 9 Hit Dice) with two Sthdevd assist¬ 
ants (5 + 8 Hit Dice). 

It is 25% probable that a 6th-levd deep gnome will have illu¬ 
sionist abilities of 5th, 6th. or 7th level. Deep Gnomes who are 
not illusionists gain the ability at 6th level to summon an earth 
elemental 150% chance of success) once per day. Deep gnome 
clerics have no ability to turn undead. 

Ecology: Stealth, cleverness, and tenacity enable the svirfneblin 
to survive in the extremely hostile environment of the Under¬ 
dark. They love gems, especially rubies, and will take great risks 
in order to gain them. Their affinity for stone is such that crea¬ 
tures from the elemental plane of Earth are 90% unlikely to harm 
a deep gnome, though they might demand a hefty tithe in gems or 
precious metals for allowing the gnome to escape. 

Tinker Gnome (Mlnoi) 

Cheerful, industrious, and inept, tinker gnomes originated on 
Rrynn, but they have spread to many other worlds via spell jam¬ 
ming ships. Physically similar to rock gnomes, even to the extent 
of sharing the same infravision range, magic resistance, combat 
bonuses, and detection abilities, their history and culture axe so 
radically different as to qualify them tor consideration as a sepa¬ 
rate subrace. 


&gt;60 










Gnome 


Graceful and quick in their movements, tinker gnomes hands 
are deft and sure. Tinkers have rich brown skin, white hair, and 
china-blue or violet eyes. Males favor oddly-styled beards and 
moustaches, and both sexes have rounded ears and typically 
large gnomish noses. Tinkers who avoid getting blown up in an 
experiment live for 250-300 years. 

Tinker gnomes speak very rapidly, running their words togeth¬ 
er in sentences that never seem to end. They are capable of talk¬ 
ing and listening at the same time: when two tinkers meet, they 
babble away, answering questions asked by the other as part of 
the same continuous sentence, 

Combatt Tinker gnomes rarely carry weapons, although some of 
their ever present tools can be pressed into service at need. How¬ 
ever they delight in invention and are always devising strange 
weapons of dubious utility from the three barrel water blaster to 
the multiple spear fllnger. Tinkers can wear any type of armor 
but typically outfit themselves in a variety of mismatched pieces 
for an effective AC of 5. 

Habitat Society: Tinker gnomes establish colonies consisting of 
immense tunnel complexes in secluded mountain ranges. The 
largest gnome settlement on Krynn, beneath Mount Nevermind, 
is home to some 59,000 tinkers. Other tinker gnome colonies ex¬ 
ist, both on Krynn and elsewhere, but their populations seldom 
exceed 200-400, 

All tinkers have a Life Quest: to attain perfect understanding 
of a single device. Few ever actually attain this goal, but their 
individual Life Quests do keep the ever hopeful tinkers busy. 
Males and females are equal in tinker society and each pursue 
Life Quests with similar devotion. Each tinker gnome belongs to 
a guild. The guild occupies the same place in a tinker s life that 
the clan occupies for other gnomes. Together the guildmasters 
make up a grand council that governs the community. 

Though most tinker gnomes are content to stay home and tin¬ 
ker with their projects, some have Life Quests which require 
them to venture out into the world. Adventuring gnomes are 
generally unable to learn from past experience and repeat the 
same mistakes, yet they are often successful with quirky solu¬ 
tions to save the day tor their companions. 

Ecology: Despite their great friendliness, tinker gnomes are not 
well-liked by other races; their technological bent makes them 
quite alien to those accustomed to magic, and their poor under¬ 
standing ot social relations puts off many potential friends. Sages 
generally agree that the tinkers' indiscriminate trumpeting of 
technology has discouraged its development by other races who 
have encountered tinker gnomes. 

Forest Gnome 

Shy and elusive, the forest gnomes live deep in forests and shun 
contact with other races except in times of dire emergencies 
threatening their beloved woods. The smallest of all the gnomes, 
they average 2 to 2ri 2 feet in height, with bark-colored, gray- 
green skin dark hair, and blue, brown, or green eyes. A very 
long-lived people, they have an average life expectancy of 500 
years. 



In addition to their own gnomish dialect, most forest gnomes 
can speak gnome common frock gnome}, Elf, Treant, and a sim¬ 
ple language that enables them to communicate on a very basic 
level with forest animals. All forest gnomes have the innate abili¬ 
ty to pass without trace. hide in woodlands {90% chance of suc¬ 
cess), and the same saving throw bonus as their rock gnome 
cousins. 

Combat: Forest gnomes prefer boobie traps and missile weapons 
to melee weapons when dealing with enemies. Due to size and 
quickness they receive a -4 bonus to Armor Class whenever 
they are fighting M- or L-sized opponents. Forest gnomes receive 
a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls when fighting ores, 
lizardmen, troglodytes, or any creature which they have seen 
damage their forest. 

HabitabSoctety; Forest gnomes live in small villages of less than 
100 gnomes, each family occupying a large, hollowed-out tree. 
Most of these villages are disguised so well that even an elf or a 
ranger could walk through one without realizing it. 

Ecology: Forest gnomes are guardians of the woods and friends 
to the animals that live there. They will often help lost travellers 
but will strive to remain unseen while doing so.

These ugly, dour cousins of gnomes are able to become giant¬ 
sized at will. 

In either size, spriggans look basically the same. They are ugly, 
thick-bodied humanoids, with pale or dull yellow skin, brown or 
black hair and red eyes. On rare occasions a spriggan may have 
red hair, which they believe is a symbol of good luck. Their noses 
are large and bulbous, but not beyond the human norm. They 
are very fond of mustaches and bushy sideburns, but they never 
clean or comb them. This same policy of uncleanliness extends to 
their bodies and any other possessions. Spriggans smell of dank 
earth, stale sweat, and grime. 

Outside of their lair they always wear armor and carry weap¬ 
ons, usually polearms, although they have been known to carry 
swords or maces. Spriggans never use shields. They like to carry 
several nasty little daggers concealed in various places in their 
armor. Spriggans never wear jewelry or other ornaments. They 
prefer to keep these things with their hoard, where they brood 
over them at odd moments. 

Combat; Spriggans are tricky and tough in battle. They have a 
wide variety of options for combat. Their major ability is to 
change from small to giant size at will. Weapons, armor and oth¬ 
er inanimate objects cm their person shrink and grow with them. 
This action takes the whole round, during which they can move 
up to 30 feet but not tight. When small, spriggans can use the 
following spell-like effects; affect normal fires, shatter, and scare 
(with a *~2 penalty to the saving throw, due to their ugliness). 
They can perform any one of these instead of fighting, once in 
any round, as often as they want. When giant-sized, spriggans 
cannot perform magic, other than to shrink again. In this form 
they are as strong as hill giants (19). 

In either size, they have Sth-level thief abilities like those of a 
gnome w f ith an 18 Dexterity. This high Dexterity enables them to 
use a weapon twice each round* They can pick pockets (75%), 
open locks (78%), find or remove traps (70%), move silently 
(77%), hide in shadows (64%), hear noise (35%), climb walls 
(81 %), and read languages (40%). Keep in mind that their size 
may affect these chances indirectly. For example* it is difficult for 
a 12-foot-tall giant to hide in a 6-foot-tall shadow. They can 
backstab only while in small form, and they inflict triple damage 
if Successful. 

Spriggans can never quite get organized as groups. In fact. 


they are sometimes encountered with part of the group giant- 
sized and part of them gnome-sized* On an individual level they 
are very clever and use their abilities to the fullest to accomplish 
their goals. These goats are usually to cause great havoc and 
mayhem amongst other races. They seem to take great pleasure 
in destroying property and hurting innocent creatures. 

Hahitat/Society; Spriggans usually travel in packs* all of them 
male. The females keep to dismal burrows or secret dens in 
forgotten ruins* rarely venturing out farther than necessary to 
gather food. A female has the same combat abilities as a male 
except that they have only 7 + 4 Hi! Dice in giant form. The fe¬ 
males mate with males from packs that wander nearby. The chil¬ 
dren are cast out upon reaching maturity, the males to join up 
with packs and the females to find a place to lair. Spriggan infant 
mortality is high, with the males 130%) surviving more often 
than the females (60%). 

Spriggans hate gnomes more than any living creatures, but 
they truly love none but those of their own ilk. Perhaps it is the 
similarity of the true gnomes to their race that drives their ha¬ 
tred. They like to terrorize, rob, and otherwise work vile deeds. 
They do not hesitate to attack or steal from traveling groups or 
small settlements in their area. All of their possessions, including 
their armor and weapons, are stolen from their victims. They 
greatly fear large groups of organized humans and demihumans, 
and they avoid such parties. 

Ecology; The roving packs of males tend to be meat eaters, pre¬ 
ferring to hunt or steal their food. As such they must keep mov¬ 
ing and establish wide areas of control. The females tend to eal 
fruits and grains that can be easily gathered near their dens. They 
eat meat only when offered by a male as part of the mating ritual. 

Spriggans are too mean and nasty to have any natural preda¬ 
tors. although gnomes attack them on sight unless faced with 
overwhelming odds. It usually takes a well-armed party to root 
out a band of spriggans*

These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for 
their great numbers. 

Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide 
mouths and small, sharp tangs. Their foreheads slope back, and 
their eyes are usually dull and glazed. They always walk upright, 
but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors 
range From yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. 
Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color 
skin. Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yel¬ 
low. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull 
soiled-looking colors. 

Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of hu¬ 
mans, in addition to their own language, some goblins can speak 
in the kobold, ore, and hobgoblin tongues. 

Combat: Goblins hate bright sunlight, and fight with a -1 on 
their attack rolls when in it. This unusual sensitivity to light, 
however, serves the goblins well underground, giving them infra¬ 
vision out to 60 feet. They can use any sort of weapon, preferring 
those that take little training, like spears and maces. They are 
known to carry short swords as a second weapon, They are usu¬ 
ally armored in leather, although the leaders may have chain or 
even plate mail. 

Goblin strategies and tactics are simple and crude. They are 
cowardly and will usually avoid a face-to-face fight. More often 
than not, they will attempt to arrange an ambush of their foes. 

Habitat/Society: Humans would consider the caves and under¬ 
ground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few 
tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only 
active at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of 
sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be 
somewhat resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth. 

They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for 
eating and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. Ail 
their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is 
kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, 
although they do manufacture their own garments and leather 
goods. The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins. 

A typical goblin tribe has 40-400 (4dl0 x 10) adult male war¬ 
riors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assist¬ 



ants, each having 1 Hit Die (7 hit points). For every 200 goblins 
there will be a sub-chief and 2-8 (2d4) bodyguards, each of which 
has 1 + 1 Hit Dice (8 hit points), is Armor Class 5. and armed 
with a battle axe, The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2-8 (2d4) 
bodyguards each of 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 4, and armed with 
two weapons. 

There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted 
upon huge worgs, and have another 10-40 Ud4xl0) unmounted 
worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded 
by 5-30 (5d6) such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2-12 (2d6) bug¬ 
bears. Goblin shamans are rare, but have been known to reach 
7th level, Their spheres include: Divination, Healing (reversed), 
Protection, and Sun (reversed). 

In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to 
60% of their number and children equal to the total number of 
adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles. 

A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order: each member knows 
who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst 
themselves constantly to move up this social ladder. 

They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will 
have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the 
tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a com¬ 
mon chain when sleeping. 

Goblins hale most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in 
particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible. 

Ecology: Goblins Jive only 50 years or so. They do not need to 
eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any 
creature from rats and snakes to humans. In lean times they will 
eat carrion. Goblins usually spoil their habitat* driving game 
from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent 
miners, able to note new or unusual construction in an under¬ 
ground area 25% of the time, and any habitat will soon be ex¬ 
panded by a maze-like network of tunnels.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. The construc¬ 
tion ol one involves mighty magic and elemental forces. 

Background: Golems predate any known literature about their creation. 
The wizard who discovered the process, if indeed there was only one, is 
unknown. Some of the rediscoverers have written their secrets in various 
arcane manuals, enchanted to aid the reader in construction. It is thought 
that the first golem created was a flesh golem, possibly an accident ol 
some great wizard experimenting with reanimating human bodies. Flesh 
golems are easier to make than any other sort because they are made of 
organic material that once lived. Later the process was generalized to suit 
certain earthen materials, which produce much stronger golems. 

Theory: Golems are all made from elemental material. So far, the great 
wizards have only discovered how to use various earthen materials, such 
as clay, stone, iron, and even glass, lo make golems. The exceptions, such 
as the flesh golem, use organic materials as components. The animating 
force of the golem is an elemental spirit from the elemental plane of Earth. 
Since the spirit is not a natural part of the body, it is not affected by most 
spells or even by most weapons (see individual descriptions). The process 
of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and 
enslaves it to the will of the golem's creator The nature of this spirit is 
unknown, and has so far eluded the grasp of all researchers. What is 
known is that it is hostile to all Prime Material plane life forms, especially 
toward the spell caster that bound il to the golem. 

Carving or assembling the golems physical body is an exacting task. Most 
spell casters end up hiring skilled labor to do it for them, such as a stone 
mason or dwarf tor stone golems, etc. If the maker has no experience working 
in that material, the construction time ts doubled. The standard spells for 
creating golems specify the size ol the creature. Anything bigger or smaller 
will not work, although some have investigated spells tor other sizes of go¬ 
lems. with limited success 

The costs listed include the base physical body and the unusual materi¬ 
als and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part 
of the golem. The rituals used to animate the golem require as much as a 
full uninterrupted month to complete fincluded in the time below), 
though some variants such as the necrophidius and scarecrow reduce that 
time by employing shortcuts. In all cases the spells used can come from 
devices, such as wands or scrolls. If a magical tome is used to make the 
golem, no spells are needed, and the level of the spell caster can be signifi¬ 
cantly lower.

Combat; All golems share several: traits in common. They are all immune 
to all forms of poison and cannoi be affected by hold, charm fear, or 
other mindbased spells, as they have no minds of their own. Certain 
spells can harm golems- these are mentioned below 
Most golems are tearless and need never check morale. 


Flesh Golems 

The pieces of the golem must be sewn together from the dead bodies of 
normal humans that have not decayed significantly. A minimum of 6 dif¬ 
ferent bodies must be used, one for each limb, one for the torso (with 
head), and a different one for the brain. In some cases, more bodies may 
be necessary to form a complete golem. The spells needed are wish, poly* 
morph any object r geas. protection from normal missiles, and strength. 

Clay Golems 

Only a lawful good priest can create a day golem. The body is sculpted 
from a single block of clay weighing at least 1000 pounds, which takes 
about a month. The vestments, which cost 30,000 gp. are the only mate^ 
rials that are not consumed and can be reused, reducing the total cost 
after the first golem. The spells used are resurrection, animate object 
commune r prayer, and bless. 

Stone Golems 

A stone golem s body is chiseled trom a single block of hard stone, such as 
granite, weighing at least 3000 pounds, which takes 2 months. The rituals 
to animate require another month. The materials and spell components 
alone cost 60,000 gold pieces and the spells used are iw*sh f polymorph any 
object, geos, and slow. 

Iron Golems 

It takes 5000 pounds of iron,to build the body, which must be done by a 
skilled iron smith. The spoils used in the ritual are wish, polymorph any 
object, geas and cloud kill Construction of the body requires an ornate 
sword which is incorporated into the monster. A magical sword can be 
used, in which case there is a 50% chance that it is drained of magic when 
the golem is animated. The golem can only use those abilities of the 
sword that are automatic. Any property that requires a command word 
and any sentient ability of the sword is lost. If the sword is ever removed 
from Lhe golem, it loses all of Its magic. 

Variant Golems 

The first golems were, undoubtedly all traditional golems. Over the 
years, however, various wizards and priests examined the techniques em¬ 
ployed by earlier designers and modified them, As they introduced 
changes, they documented the processes they used lo create lheir new 
constructs. This process of study and modification is never-ending. Even 
tuday. the work of these mysterious scholars is being studied and revised 
in magical colleges around the world. 

Theory- Like other golems, golem variants depend on the powerful forces 
of elemental magic to animate them. They have no lives, of their own and 
are animated by a spirit from the elemental plane of Earth, In some cases 
this spirit is tricked, lured, or forced into animating the body while in 
other cases it comes willingly. In the former cases, the si one construct 
sometimes breaks free of the influence of its creator and becomes a free- 
willed entity. Because of the nature of its physical shell, constructs that 
break free often become berserk killers, destroying everything in their 
paths before being annihilated themselves. 

Construction: The actual construction of any golem s physical body is a 
tiring and demanding task. Although the steps required to create a vari¬ 
ant golem differ depending on the type, they do have some elements in 
common. The most important ot these is the degree ot detail that is put 
into the carving of the body. In the case of the caryatid column, for exam¬ 
ple, the construct must be lovingly crafted with great skill. In most cases, 
the wizard or priest creating a caryatid column hires a professional sculp¬ 
tor or stone mason to undertake this step of the animation process. 

Less sophisticated golems, like the stone guardian and the primitive 
scarecrow, do not require the artistic perfection of the caryatid column. 
However, they are often covered with delicate mystical runes or glyphs 
that must be perfect if the creature is to be successfully animated. 

Bone Golem 

The body of a bone golem is assembled wholly from the bones of ani¬ 
mated skeletons who have been defeated in combat. Any type of skeletal 
undead will do, but all must have been created and slain in the Demiplane 
of Dread, Only 10% ol the bones from any given skeleton can be used, so 
the final product is the compilation of bones from many creatures. Often, 
there will be animal, monster, and human bones in the same golem, giv- 


164 




Golem, General 


ing the creature a nightmarish appearance. The spells woven over the 
body must include animate dead, symbol of fear, binding, and 

Caryaiid column 

The caryatid column can be created by a priest or wizard using a special 
version of the manual of golems Whenever such a tome is discovered, 
there is a 20% chance that It describes a caryatid column, 

Doll Golem 

TTiese creatures resemble a child s toy“oftcm a baby doll or stuffed ani¬ 
mal. Doll golems can serve as either the guardians of children or as mur¬ 
dering things too foul to contemplate 

The spells needed to complete the animation are imbue with spell abili¬ 
ty Toshas uncontrollable hideous laughter, r uniholy word „ bless and 
prayer The first known examples of this type of golem turned up on the 
Demiplane oF Dread in the land of Sanguinia. 

Gargoyle Golem 

This creature is fashioned in the image of a real gargoyle and is often 
placed a* a warden atop buildings, cathedrals, or tombs. It is most similar 
to the stone golem; the body must be carved from a single slab of granite 
i weighing 3,000 pounds) and prepared with expensive components Only 
the vestments created for the process are reusable (saving 15,000 gp on 
the cost of additional gargoyle golems). The spells required to complete 
the process a re bless exaction. iuttlholy word, stone shape, coniine earth 
elemental and prayer 

Glass Golem 

The glass golem is composed entirely of stained glass. Perhaps the most artis¬ 
tic of all golems, its creation requires the following spells: gkssfeel. animate 
object prismatic spray, rainbow and wish Because of the mixture of spells, 
this type of golem is usually built by multi* or dual-classed characters or with 
the aid of a powerful assistant. 

The first appearance ol glass golems is not recorded with certainty. It is 
believed that they were created by a spell-caster who fancied himself an 
artist (hence their eerie beauty), but no one knows. 

Juggernaut 

Juggernauts that can alter their form require an extra step in their crea¬ 
tion. which normally resembles the process to make a stone golem. Prior 



to animating a juggernaut, the wizard must use the mimic blood as a ma¬ 
terial component in the final spells woven over the body. This addition 
gives this golem variant intelligence and an alignment, 

Necrophidius 

A necrophidius may be created in one of three ways. The first is a special 
form of manual of golems that provides secrets of its construction. The 
Necrophidicon, as il is called, must be burnt to ashes that provide the 
monsters animating force. The other two arcane and priestly processes 
are long and complex. A wizard must cast limited wish , ge«s. and charm 
person spells, A priest require? the spells quest, neutralize poison prayer 
silence, and snake charm. Whichever method is used, I he monster re¬ 
quires a complete giant snake skeleton (either poisonous or constrictor), 
slain within 24 hours of the enchantments commencement. Each ne¬ 
crophidius is built for a single specific purpose (which must bo in the 
spellcasters mind when he creates it), such as 'Kill Ragrtar the Bold," The 
necrophidius never seeks to twist the intent of its maker, but its enchant¬ 
ments fade when its task is done or cannot be completed; for example, 
when it kills Ragnar. 

The maker must want the necrophidius to serve its purpose. He could 
not, for example, build a death worm to "Sneak into the druid s hut and 
steal his staff T if he really intended for the necrophidius to merely pro¬ 
vide a distraction. He could not build more than one death worm and 
assign both to kill Ragnar, since he could not imbue the second death 
worm with a task that he intended the first one to complete. For this rea¬ 
son. necrophidii almost never work as a team. 

Rumors claim that there were once methods to make a necrophidius 
gain J Hit Die every century it was pursuing its purpose. 

Scarecrow 

Scarecrows can only be created either by using a special manual or by a 
god answering the plea of a priest employing the following spells: uni- 
mafe object, prayer, command and quest. The final step of the process, 
casting the quest spell, is done during a new moon. 

Scarecrows can be constructed to kill a specific person. To do so the 
clothes worn by the scarecrow must come from the intended victim. 
Once the scarecrow is animated, the priest need only utter a single 
word—"Quest". The scarecrow then moves in a direct line toward the 
victim. When it reaches the victim, the scarecrow disregards all other be¬ 
ings and concentrates its gaze and attacks entirely on the person it has 
been created to kill. After slaying its victim, a quested scarecrows magic 
dissipates and it collapses into dust. 

Stone Guardian 

A stone guardian is very' similar to a traditional stone golem, but it has 
some unique abilities its ancestor does not In physical appearance, the 
two constructs are quite similar, but the stone guardian is usually deco¬ 
rated with runes and magical glyphs. 

A stone guardian is created with the following spells; enchant an item 
transmute mud fn rock, magic mouth and limited wish or wish. In addi¬ 
tion, the wizard creating the guardian may cast a detect invisible spell to 
give the creature that power. 

The initial material of the body is mud around a heart of polished 
stone. As the various spells are woven into the body, a spirit from the 
elemental plane of Earth is forced to enter the body and animate it. Be¬ 
cause the spirit is there against its will, there is a 20% chance that the 
golem goes berserk each time it is activated, 

A special of protection can be created when the stone guardian is 
animated; this prevents the guardian from striking at anyone wearing it. 
In addition, all those within TO feet of the ring wearer are also immune to 
attack. Rings oi this type function only against the guardian they were 
made with and provide nu protection from any other golem.

A greater golem is an artificial humanoid body which has been 
animated by an elemental spirit but remains under the complete 
control of its creator. 

Stone Golem 

A stone golem isQ 1 ? feet tall and weighs around 2000 pounds. 
Its body is of roughly chiseled stone, frequently stylized to suit its 
creator. For example it might be carved to to look like it is wear¬ 
ing armor with a particular symbol on the chest plate. Sometimes 
designs are worked into the stone of its limbs. The head may be 
chiseled to resemble a helmet or other head piece. Regardless of 
these elements, it always has the basic humanoid parts (2 arms, 2 
legs, head with 2 eyes, nose, mouth etc.). It is always weaponless 
and never wears clothing. 

Combat: Greater golems are mindless in combat, only follow- 
mg the simple tactics of their masters. They are completely emo¬ 
tionless and cannot be swayed in any way from their 
instructions They will not pick up and use weapons in combat, 
even if ordered to, always preferring their fists. Stone golems 
have a strength of 22, for purposes of breaking or throwing 
things. 

The stone golem is immune to any weapon, except those of + 2 
or better enchantment. A rock to mud spell slows a golem for 
2-12 (2d6) rounds. Its reverse, mud to rock acts to heal the golem, 
restoring all lost hit points. A flesh to stone spell does not actu¬ 
ally change the golem's structure, but does make it vulnerable to 
any normal attack for the following round, This does not include 
spells, except those that will cause direct damage. All other spells 
are ignored. Once every other round, the stone golem can cast a 
sloir spell upon any opponent with 10 feet of it. 

Habitat Society: Golems are automatons, artificially created 
and under the direct control of their creator. They have no socie- 
tv and are not associated with any particular habitat. They are 
frequently used to guard valuable items or places. Unlike the 
lesser golems, the greater golems are always under the complete 
control of their master, A greater golem can obey simple instruc¬ 
tions involving direct actions with simple conditional phrases. 
Although this is better than a lesser golem is capable of follow¬ 
ing, they still make poor servants Any given task could take sev¬ 
eral separate commands to direct the golem to its completion. 



Ecology: Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in 
the ecology of the world. They neither eat nor sleep, and 'live" 
until they are destroyed, usually in combat. Certain spells (see 
above) can be used to heal or repair any damage done to them in 
combat. This is usually done by their creators to insure long and 
valuable service. 

Iron Golem 

An iron golem is twice the height of a normal man, and weighs 
around 5000 pounds. It can be fashioned in any stylized manner, 
just like the stone golems, although it almost always is built dis¬ 
playing armor of some sort, its features are much smoother in 
contrast to the stone golem, Iron golems are sometimes found 
with a short sword (relative to their size) in one hand. On ex¬ 
tremely rare occasions this sword will be magical. 

The iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, 
nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a pon¬ 
derously smooth gait at hall the speed of a normal man. Each 
step causes the floor to tremble, unless it is on a thick, solid 
foundation* 

Combat: The iron golem conforms to the strategies listed for 
the stone golem except as described here. It has a strength of 24 
for the purposes of lifting, throwing or breaking objects. The 
iron golem is immune to any weapon, except those of +3 or bet¬ 
ter enchantment. Magical electrical attacks will slow it for 3 
rounds, and magical fire attacks actually repair 1 hit point of 
damage for each hit die of damage it would have caused. All oth¬ 
er spells are ignored. Iron golems are subject to the damage in¬ 
flicted by a rust monster. Once every 7 rounds, beginning either 
the first or second round of combat, the iron golem breathes out 
a doud of poisonous gas. Jt does this automatically, with no re¬ 
gard to the effects it might have. The gas cloud fills a 10 foot cube 
directly in front of it, which dissipates by the following round, 
assuming there is somewhere for the gas to go.

A golem is an artificial humanoid body which is animated by an ele¬ 
mental spirit and under the control of its creator. 

Flesh Golem 

The flesh golem stands a head and a half faller than most humans and 
weighs almost 350 pounds. It is made from a ghoulish collection of 
stolen human body parts, stitched together to form a single compos- 
ite human body. Its skin is the sickly green or yellow of partially de¬ 
cayed flesh. A flesh golem smells faintly of freshly dug earth and 
dead flesh. No natural animal, such as a dog. will willingly track a 
flesh golem. It wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually 
just a ragged pair of trousers, ft has no possessions, and no weapons. 
The golem can not speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. 
It walks and moves with a stiff jointed gait, as if it is not in complete 
control over its body parts. 

Combat: The lesser golems are mindless in combat, They follow the 
orders of their master explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or 
tactics. They are emotionless in combat, and cannot be easily pro¬ 
voked (unless they have broken control and gone berserk). They will 
not use weapons for combat even if ordered to, always preferring to 
strike with their fists. Flesh golems have a strength of 19 for purposes of 
lifting, throwing or breaking down doors. 

Flesh golems can only be struck by a magical weapon. Fire and 
cold based spells merely slow them for 2-12 (2d6) rounds. Any elec¬ 
trical attack restores 1 hit point for each die of damage it would nor¬ 
mally have done All other spells are ignored by the creature. 

The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, result¬ 
ing in a J % cumulative chance per round of combat, calculated inde¬ 
pendently for each fight, that it will break free of its master. The flesh 
golem s master has a 10% chance per round of regaining control. To 
do this he must be within 60 feet of the flesh golem, and the creature 
must be able to see and hear its master. No special spells are required 
to regain control, its creator just has to talk to it forcefully and per¬ 
suasively. to convince it to obey. 

HabitatSodety: Golems are automatons, artificially created and 
under the direct control of their creator. They have no society and 
are not associated with any particular habitat. They are frequently 
used to guard valuable items or places. A lesser golem can obey sim¬ 
ple instructions involving a single, direct action. They make poor ser¬ 
vants because each detail of a task must be given as a separate 
command. 



Ecology; Golems are not natural creatures, and play no part in the 
world’s ecology. They neither eat nor sleep, and ‘live’’ until their 
bodies are destroyed, usually in combat. 

Clay Golem 

The clay golem is a humanoid body made from day. and stnds about 
IS inches taller than a normal man. It weighs around 600 pounds. The 
features are grossly distorted from the human norm. The chest is over¬ 
ly large, with arms attached by thick knots of muscle at the shoulder 
Its arms hang down to its knees, and end in short stubby fingers. It has 
no neck, and a large head with broad flat features. Its legs are short and 
bowed, with wide flat feet, A day golem wears no clothing except for a 
metal or stiff leather garment around Its hips. It smells faintly of day. 
The golem can not speak, or make any noise. It walks and moves with 
a slow and clumsy gait, almost as if it were not in control over its 
actions. 

Combat: Clay golems conform to the strategies listed above for the 
flesh golem except as noted here. A day golem has a strength of 20 
for the purposes of iifLing, throwing or smashing objects. They can 
only be struck by magical blunt weapons such as hammers or maces. 
A move earth spdl will drive the golem back 120 feet and inflict 3-36 
Gdl2) points of damage upon it. A disintegrate spell merely slows 
the golem for 1-6 rounds and causes 1-12 points of damage. An earth¬ 
quake spell cast directly at a clay golem will stop it from moving that 
turn and inflict 5-50 (5dIQ) points of damage. After it has engaged in 
at least one round of combat, the day golem can haste itself for 3 
rounds. It can only do this once per day. Damage done by the golem 
can only be cured by a heal spell from a priest of 17th level or greater, 
The elemental spirit in a lesser golem is not bound strongly, result¬ 
ing in a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat, calculated inde¬ 
pendently for each fight, that it will break free of its master. If a day 
golem does manage to break control, it becomes a berserker, attack¬ 
ing everything in sight until it is destroyed. Its first action is to haste 
itself, if it can, Unlike the flesh golem, there is no chance to regain 
control of a rampaging day golem.

Bone Golem 

The bone golem is built from the previously animated bones of 
skeletal undead. These horrors stand roughly 6 feet tall and 
weight between 50 and 60 pounds. They are seldom armored and 
can easily be mistaken for undead, much to the dismay of those 
who make this error. 

Combat: Bone golems are no more intelligent than other forms of 
golem, so they will not employ dever tactics or strategies in com¬ 
bat, Their great power, however, makes them far deadlier than 
they initially appear to be There is a 95% chance that those not 
familiar with the true nature of their opponent will mistake them 
for simple undead. 

Bone golems attack with their surprisingly strong blows and 
sharp, daw-like fingers. Each successful hit inflicts 3-24 &lt;3dS) 
points of damage. They can never be made to use weapons of any 
sort in melee. 

In addition to the common characteristics of ail Ravenloft go¬ 
lems (described previously), bone golems take only half damage 
from those edged or piercing weapons that can harm them. 

Bone golems are immune to almost all spells, but can be laid 
low with the aid of a shatter spell that is focused on them and has 
the capacity to affect objects of their weight. If such a spell is cast 
at a bone golem, the golem is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells 
to negate it. Failure indicates that weapons able to harm the go¬ 
lem will now inflict twice the damage they normally would. 
Thus, edged weapons would do full damage while blunt ones 
would inflict double damage. 

Once every three rounds, the bone golem may throw back its 
head and issue a hideous laugh that causes all those who hear it to 
make fear and horror checks. Those who fail either check are 
paralyzed and cannot move for 2-12 rounds. Those who fail frofJi 
checks are instantly stricken dead with fear. 



DoU Golem 

The doll golem is an animated version of a child's toy that can 
be pul to either good uses I defending the young) or evil uses (at¬ 
tacking them). It is often crafted so as to make it appear bright 
and cheerful when at rest. Upon activation, however, its features 
become twisted and horrific. 

Combat: The doll golem is, like all similar creatures, immune to 
almost all magical attacks. It can be harmed by fire-based spells, 
although these do only half damage, while a warp wood spell 
will affect the creature as if it were a stem? spell. A mending spell 
restores the creature to full hit points at once. 

Each round, the doll golem leaps onto a victim and attempts to 
bite it, Success inflicts 3d6 points of damage and forces the victim 
to save versus spells. Failure to save causes the victim to begin to 
laugh uncontrollably (as if under the influence of a Tosha's un¬ 
controllable hideous laughter spell) and become unable to per¬ 
form any other action. The effects of the creature's bite are far 
worse, however. The victim begins to laugh on the round after 
the failed save. At this time, they take ld4 points of damage from 
the muscle spasms imposed by the laughter. On following 
rounds, this increases to 2d4, then 3d4, and so on. The laughter 
stops when the character dies or receives a dispel magic , Follow* 
ing recovery, the victim suffers a penalty on all attack and saving 
throws of -1 per round that they were overcome with laughter 
(e,g,, four rounds of uncontrolled laughter would equal a -4 pen¬ 
alty on attack/saving throws). This represents the weakness 
caused by the character’s inability to breathe and is reduced by 1 
point per subsequent turn until the character is fully recovered.

Gargoyle Golems 

The gargoyle golem is a stone construct designed to guard a given 
structure* It is roughly the same size and weight as a real gargoyle 
(6' tail and 550 pounds). Although they have wings, they cannot 
fly* However, a gargoyle golem can leap great distances (up to 
100 feet) and will often use this ability to drop down on enemies 
nearing any building the golem is protecting. 

Gargoyle golems cannot speak or communicate in any way. 
When they move, the sound of grinding rock can be heard by 
anyone near them. In fact, it is often this noise that serves as a 
party's first warning that something is amiss in an area. 

Combat: When a gargoyle golem attacks in melee combat, it does 
so with its two clawed fists* Each fist must attack the same target 
and will inflict 3d6 points of damage. Anyone hit by both attacks 
must save versus petrification or be turned to stone. On the 
round after a gargoyle golem has petrified a victim, it will attack 
that same target again Any hit scored by the golem against such 
a foe indicates that the stone body has shattered and cannot be 
resurrected , Remcamotion, on the other hand, is still a viable 
option. 

Gargoyle golems are, like most golems, immune to almost eve¬ 
ry form of magical attack directed at them. They are, however, 
vulnerable to the effects of an earthquake spell. If such a spell is 
targeted directly at a gargoyle golem, it instantly shatters the 
creature without affecting the surrounding area. The lesser trans¬ 
mute rock to mud spell will inflict 2dl0 points of damage to the 
creature while the reverse (transmute mud to rock) will heal a 
like amount of damage* 

On the first round of any combat in which the gargoyle golem 
has not been identified for what it is, it has a good chance of gain¬ 
ing surprise (-2 on opponent surprise checks). Whenever a gar¬ 
goyle golem attacks a character taken by surprise, it will leap 
onto that individual* The crushing weight of the creature delivers 
4dI0 points of damage and requires every object carried by that 
character in a vulnerable position (DM s decision) to save vs. 
crushing blows or be destroyed. In the round that a gargoyle go¬ 
lem pounces on a character, it cannot attack with its fists. 



Glass Golems 

The glass golem is very nearly a work of art. Built in the form 
of a stained glass knight, the creature is often built into a window 
fashioned from such glass* Thus, It usually acts as the guardian 
of a given location—often a church or shrine. 

Glass golems, like most others, never speak or communicate in 
any way. When they move, however, they are said to produce a 
tinkling sound like that made by delicate crystal wind chimes. If 
moving through a lighted area, they strobe and flicker as the light 
striking them is broken into its component hues. 

Combat: When the stained glass golem attacks, it often has the 
advantage of surprise. If its victims have no reason to suspect 
that it lurks in a given window, they suffer a -3 on their surprise 
roll when the creature makes its presence known. 

Once combat is joined, the stained glass figure (which always 
has the shape of a knight) strikes with is sword. Each blow that 
lands delivers 2dl2 points of damage* 

Once every three rounds, the golem can unleash a prismatic 
spray spell from its body that fans out in all directions* Any ob¬ 
ject or being (friend or foe) within 25 feet of the golem must roll 
as if they had been struck by a wizard s prismatic spray spell (see 
the AD&amp;D* Players Handbook ), 

Glass golems are the most fragile of any type of Raverdoft go¬ 
lem, Any blunl weapon capable of striking them (that h. a magi¬ 
cal weapon of +2 or better) inflicts double damage. Further, a 
shatter spell directed at them weakens them so that all subse- 
quent melee attacks have a percentage chance equal to twice the 
number of points of damage inflicted of instantly slaying the 
creature. 

Anyone casting a mending spell on one of these creatures in¬ 
stantly restores it to full hit points. In addition., they regenerate 1 
hit point per round when in an area of direct sunlight (or its 
equivalent),

The necrophidius and scarecrow are constructs like all other go¬ 
lems, but they are less powerful because of the magical shortcuts 
employed in their construction. 

Necrophidius 

The necrophidius, or ‘death worm," is built and animated for a 
single task, such as protection or assassination. It has the 
bleached-white skeleton of' a giant snake, a famged human skull, 
and constantly whirling, milk-white eyes. Its bones are warm to 
the touch. The necrophidius is odorless and absolutely silent; the 
skeleton makes no noise, even when slithering across a floor 
strewn with leaves. A necrophidius is constantly moving with a 
macabre grace. 

Combat: The necrophidius prefers to surprise opponents, and its 
silence imposes a -* 2 penalty to their surprise rolls. It" the ne¬ 
crophidius is not surprised, it performs a macabre maneuver 
called the Dance of Death, a hypnotic swaying backed by minor 
magic. The Dance rivets the attention of anyone who observes it, 
unless a successful saving throw vs, spell is rolled. Intelligent vic¬ 
tims are immobilized, as per the hypnotism spell. This allows the 
necrophidius to attack without opposition. 

Besides taking damage as indicated, a bitten victim must make 
a saving throw vs. spell or be paralyzed and unconscious for ld4 
turns. This effect can be cancelled only by dispel magic; neutral¬ 
ize poison is useless. 

This creature acts and reacts as if it had Intelligence 10 How^ 
ever, its mind is artificial, so mind influencing spelb have no ef¬ 
fect. The creature is immune to poison and requires no sleep or 
sustenance. It is not undead and cannot be turned. 

Scarecrow 

Statistics in italics above refer to conscious scarecrows. 

Scarecrows are enchanted creatures made from the same mate¬ 
rials as normal scarecrows. Though non-intelligent, they tan fol¬ 
low simple, one- or two-phrase orders from the priest who 
created them. They do so to the best of their ability, without re¬ 
gard to their own safety. 

Each scarecrow is unique, but all share several characteristics. 
Their bodies, arms, and legs are always made of cut wood bound 
with rope. Tattered rags cover the frame, and are sometimes 



stuffed with grass or straw. A hollow gourd with a carved face 
serves as head. Once animated, a fiery light burns m the scare¬ 
crow s eye sockets. Scarecrows are light but slow. Their kg and 
elbow joints bend both ways, so they move with an uneven, jer¬ 
ky gait, and the head spins freely. 

Scarecrows do not speak, but cackle madly when attacking. 

Combat: Once per round, a scarecrow can gaze at one creature 
within 40 feet. Any intelligent person meeting this gaze must 
make a successful saving throw vs, spells or be fascinated, stand¬ 
ing transfixed, arms hanging limply, allowing the scarecrow to 
strike again and again (automatic hit each round). The charm 
lasts until the scarecrow either dies or leaves the area tor a full 
turn. The scarecrow's touch causes Idb damage and has an effect 
identical to the gaze (saving throws apply), A scarecrow attacks 
one victim at a time, striking the first person charmed until dead. 
While slaying its victim, the scarecrow uses its gaze attack to 
charm other opponents as possible. Scarecrows attack until de¬ 
stroyed or ordered to stop. 

Scarecrows are vulnerable to fire. Fire-based attacks gain a + 1 
bonus to the attack roll and a +1 damage bonus per die. 

The magic that created them keeps their tattered parts from 
decomposing and shields them from the effects of cold. 

Conscious Scarecrows 

Most scarecrows disintegrate when their creators die, but a few 
(10%) become conscious, gaining an evil alignment, average In¬ 
telligence (8-10), and great cunning. They gain a desire for self- 
preservation, so their morale drops to elite (13-14). They hide by 
day and stalk the night committing acts of evil. Because scare¬ 
crows hate fire and are immune to cold, conscious scarecrows try 
to reach colder climes. During the trek they kill everything they 
encounter, including those who pose no threat. Conscious scare¬ 
crows hate all life and kill humans and demihumans whenever 
possible.

These variant golems are close relatives of the dreadful stone go¬ 
lems. They are generally created by powerful wizards and em¬ 
ployed as guards or servants in a wide variety of settings. 

Caryatid Column 

The caryatid column is a beautiful and wondrous construct, Be¬ 
fore activation, it looks like the classical architectural work it is 
named For, standing about 7 feet tall, and resembling a finely 
carved pillar in the shape of a beautiful young girl- Close exami¬ 
nation reveals that the maiden has a slender sword in her left 
hand, but there is no indication that the column is anything other 
than what it appears to be. Once constructed and animated, it is 
usually assigned to keep watch over a valuable object or special 
places. It does so, remaining motionless, until its preset activa¬ 
tion conditions are triggered (these depend on the creator's in¬ 
structions). As soon as this happens, the column moves to take 
action against those who have triggered it. 

When activated, the caryatid column undergoes a stunning 
and swift transformation. The smooth, grey stone that was once 
its skin changes hue to become light or dark flesh tones (depend¬ 
ing on the nature of the carving), the eyes come alive with a 
gleaming white light, and the thin blade transforms into a fine 
weapon of gleaming steel. 

In combat, the column lashes out with its gleaming sword, 
causing 2d4 points of damage with each hit. The columns magi¬ 
cal nature gives it a +4 bonus to saving throws, and all non- 
magical weapons inflict only half damage. Magical weapons 
inflict full damage, buL do not receive the magical bonus normal¬ 
ly due them. For example, a long sword +2 does not gain its +2 
bonus, but inflicts normal long sword damage. 

There is a 25% chance that a weapon shatters when it success¬ 
fully strikes a caryatid column. This chance is reduced by 5% for 
each plus of the weapon. Thus, a sword +2 has only a 15% 
chance of breaking, A magical weapon with no attack bonus is 
considered a +1 weapon when checking for shattering, 

A sfom? to flesh, transmute rock to mud, or stone shape spell 
destroys the column instantly if it fails its saving throw. 

When a caryatid column has completed its task, it returns to its 
wailing position and reverts to stone. If it is killed in combat, it 


(and its sword) reverts to stone for 2d6 rounds, at the end of 
which time it crumbles into dust. 

Juggernaut 

The juggernaut generally appears as a huge, powerful stone vehi¬ 
cle of some sort, with wheels or rollers for locomotion. 

A juggernaut is clumsy and slow moving, but St makes up for 
these handicaps by rolling right over opponents in a deadly 
crushing attack. A juggernaut has a movement rale of 3 in its first 
round of animation. This increases by 3 each round to a maxi¬ 
mum of 12, A juggernaut is slow to turn, and can change direc¬ 
tion only 90 degrees for even,' 30 feet of movement. 

Anyone caught in the path of a juggernaut charge is run over 
by the thundering behemoth, though the juggernaut must make a 
normal attack roll if the victim can avoid the charge. A hit indi¬ 
cates that the victim is crushed, suffering IGdlG points of dam¬ 
age. In addition, every item carried by the victim must roll a 
saving throw vs. crushing blow to avoid destruction. A success¬ 
ful saving throw vs. death magic entitles the victim to only half 
damage, but it does not protect his equipment. 

Some juggernauts are a unique crossbreed of stone golem and 
mimte, Once animated, these juggernauts can alter their shape as 
the mimics do. They can grow up to six limbs, each designed for 
current needs. For example, if it wishes to sound a warning, a 
limb may grow into a trumpet or horn, In combat, its limbs be¬ 
come maces or hammers that inflict 2d6 points of damage each, 
due to its great strength. A juggernaut can rarely bring more than 
two limbs to bear on a single opponent* 

Stone Guardian 

In combat* a guardian slams opponents with its massive arms, 
each of which inflicts ld8 +1 points of damage The stone guard¬ 
ian suffers only 1 /* damage from edged weapons and Va damage 
from all cold, fire, or electrical attacks. Normal missiles cause no 
damage. A stone guardian can be instantly destroyed by a stone 
to flesh , transmute rock to mud, stone shape, or dig spell; it is not 
entitled to a saving throw.

Gorgons are tierce, bull-like beasts who make their lairs in dreary 
caverns or the fastness of a wilderness. They are aggressive by 
nature and usually attack any creature or person they encounter. 

Monstrous black bulls, gorgons have hides of thick metal 
scales. Their breath is a noxious vapor that billows forth in great 
puffs from their wide, bull nostrils. Gorgons walk on two 
hooves, when necessary, but usually assume a four-hoofed 
stance. Despite their great size r they can move through even 
heavy forests with incredible speed, for they simply trample 
bushes and splinter smaller trees, Gorgons speak no languages 
but let out a roar of anger whenever they encounter other beings. 

Combat: Four times per day gorgons can make a breath weap¬ 
on attack ftheir preferred means of attack). Their breath shoots 
forth in a truncated cone, five feet wide at the base and 20 feet 
wide at its end, with a maximum range of 60 feel. Any creature 
caught in this cone must roll a saving throw vs. petrification. 
Those who fail are turned to stone immediately! The awareness 
of gorgons extends into the Astral and Ethereal planes, as do the 
effects of their breath weapon. 

If necessary (he., their breath weapon fails) gorgons will en¬ 
gage in melee, charging forward to deliver a vicious head butt or 
horn gore. Gorgons fight with unrestricted ferocity, slashing and 
trampling all who challenge them until they themselves are slain. 

Ha bi tat.'Society: It is believed that gorgons can actually de¬ 
vour the living statues they create with their breath weapon. 
Whether their flat iron teeth break up and pulverize the stone or 
lheir saliva returns the victim to flesh while they eat is a matter 
for conjecture, 

Their primary prey are deer and elk, but gorgons won't hesi¬ 
tate to add other meats to their diet when hungry. Their sense of 
smell is acute and once they get on the trail gorgons are 75% 
likely to track their victim successfully. Once their victim is in 
sight, gorgons let out a scream of rage and then charge. Unless 
somehow evaded, a gorgon will pursue tirelessly, for days if nec¬ 



essary, until the prey either drops from exhaustion or is caught in 
the gorgon's deadly breath, 

Gorgons have no use for treasure, hence gold and gems are 
often left petrified on the statue of the being that once wore them. 
Occasionally a gorgon in his haste will devour something of val¬ 
ue: the items will later be left in the gorgon s droppings, some¬ 
where near the entrance to its lair, 

Gorgons are usually encountered in groups of three or four— 
one male bull with two or three females. Gorgon calves are raised 
by the females to the age of two, then the young bulls are turned 
out to make their own way. Females remain with the dominant 
bull. 

About 25% of the time only a single gorgon is encountered. 
Lone gorgons are always rogue males in search of females. 

The forest around a gorgon lair is usually a crisscrossing net¬ 
work of trails and paths they've made. Occasionally there are 
clearings where the grasses were trampled down in a battle and 
perhaps the shattered remains of a statue can be found. 

Ecology: Gorgons have no natural enemies other than them¬ 
selves, Bull gorgons are often called upon to defend their posi¬ 
tions against rogue gorgons. These battles are no! usually fatal, 
but even a gorgon can be felled by a well-aimed horn gore. The 
only other creature known to hunt these fierce predators is man. 

Gorgon blood, properly prepared, can seal an area against 
ethereal or astral intrusion; their powdered scales are an ingredi¬ 
ent in the ink used to create a protection from petrification scroll. 

In addition, the hide of a gorgon can be fashioned, with con¬ 
siderable work and some magical enhancement, into a Fine set of 
scale mail. This armor will provide the wearer with a +2 bonus 
to all saving throws vs. petrification or flesh-to-stone spells.

The grell is a fearsome carnivore that looks like a giant brain with 
a vicious beak and 10 dangling tentacles, each 6 feet long. Some 
grell are rogues, while others live in family units. The "civilized” 
grell is a hive or colony creature, much like an ant or a bee. but 
far more intelligent, arrogant and dangerous. 

Grell have a weird language composed of bird-like squawks 
and chirps, combined with tentacular motion and a limited telep¬ 
athy with other grell. Other creatures cannot learn the grell lan¬ 
guage, and they would not deign to learn the language of "lesser 
beings" (a synonym for "food" in their language). 

Combat: The grell's most common strategy is to use its natural 
levitation ability to hide in the upper reaches of large chambers, 
it can then drop silently on a victim, who suffers a “3 penalty to 
surprise rolls when attacked in this way. 

A worker grell attacks with all 10 tentacles; each one that hits 
grips the opponent (the grip can be broken with a successful bend 
bars lift gates roll). For each hit. the victim must roll a saving 
throw vs. paralysis, with a +4 bonus, or be paralyzed for 5d4 
rounds. With two tentacles gripping the prey the grell can lift it 
up toward the ceiling and devour the prey when desired, A grell 
automatically hits paralyzed prey each round. 

Soldier grell often use weapons, including the tip-spear and the 
lightning lance* The tip-spear is an edged metal head which fits 
on the tip of a tentacle and is held there by suction; the weapon 
causes ld6 damage if used to slash, 2d6 if used to impale. Victims 
hit by a tip-spear must make a saving throw vs. paralysis, as if hit 
by a tentacle. The lightning lance delivers 3d6 points of electrical 
damage to those hit with it, though a successful saving throw vs. 
spells halves the damage A lightning lance starts with 36 
charges: it can use one per round. 

Any hit against a tentacle (AC 4) renders it unusable, but sub¬ 
tracts no hit points from the grell s total. Grell regenerate lost or 
damaged tentacles in 1-2 days, and are immune to electrical at¬ 
tacks. 

Grell use strategy and tactics in their battles, and can attack 
more than one opponent each round. They are intelligent enough 
to allocate their tentacle attacks in an advantageous way. They 
use their beaks only against paralyzed prey. 



Habitat/Sodety Grell have a distinct hierarchy. Each hive is led 
by a patriarch, who gives orders to the philosophers, who direct 
the soldiers and workers in their every day tasks. A hive occupies 
an underground complex, or travels by ship. 

Supposedly, all grell answer to a mysterious Imperator, a grell 
of great power who can unite all the grell for a common cause; to 
conquer a realm, a territory, or even a world. 

A grell mates but once in its 30-40 year life span. The female 
later lays a dutch of 2d4 eggs. Young are bom active and self- 
sufficient, but with only 1 Hit Die. They gain 1 Hit Die every two 
months until they reach adulthood. 

Ecology: Arrogant and vicious, grell hunt their territories to ex¬ 
haustion, then move on to more fertile places. 

A grell’s paralytic poison cannot be extracted from the crea¬ 
tures body, but parts of the monster s body can be used for spells 
or items relating to levitation or electricity. 

So Idler/Worker; These are the common grell that form the bulk 
of a hive or a raiding party Occasionally a grell will become sep- 
arated bom its fellows; these become rogues. Rogues carry no 
weapons, collect no treasure, and avoid sunlight. 

Philosopher: These grell serve as intermediaries between patri¬ 
archs and workers /soldiers. Some lead lesser grell in combat, 
and there is one philosopher for every 10 lesser grell encountered. 
Some philosophers (20%) wear powerful rings of protection, giv¬ 
ing them AC 0, About 10% of philosophers can cast spells as 
2nd level wizards. 

Patriarch: Each hive has a patriarch, a huge, sedentary mass of 
flesh that directs the lesser grell. If the patriarch is taken to a ship, 
it can dig its many tentacles into the ship and animate it, even 
make it fly to other worlds.

Often mistaken for imps, gremlins are small, winged goblinoids. 
There are many varieties of gremlins, and most are chaotic and 
mischievous. Their skin color ranges from brown to black to 
gray, frequently in a mottled blend, Their ears are very large and 
pointed, giving them a 65% chance to hear noise* A pair of bat¬ 
like wings enables them to fly or glide. Gremlins never wear 
clothing or ornamentation. 

Combat: Gremlins are worthless in reaJ combat; at every oppor¬ 
tunity they flee rather than fight face-to-face* What gremlins like 
to do best is cause trouble. The angrier their victims are, the hap¬ 
pier the gremlins. Their favorite tactic is to set up a trap to humil¬ 
iate opponents and maybe even cause them to damage a valued 
possession or hurt a loved one. If the opponent gets hurt as well, 
that's just fine. For example, the gremlin may set a trip wire 
across a doorway that pulls down a fragile vase onto the victim s 
head. A building infested by a gremlin pack can be reduced to 
shambles in a single night. 

In melee, gremlins have only their weak bite for attacks (ld4 
points of damage). They can fly quite well (MG S), but they usu¬ 
ally stay close to the ground or well over their opponents' heads, 
where they are difficult to reach. They can be hit only by magical 
weapons, and are 25% resistant to magic. Despite these defenses, 
they are cowards and fight only if cornered. 

Habitat Society; Gremlins are magical creatures that originated 
in an unknown plane of existence. They are highly susceptible to 
mutation and can interbreed with any goblinoid species. This has 
resulted in several different gremlin races, each with slightly dif¬ 
ferent abilities and natures. 

Gremlins travel in small packs, and they have a highly orga¬ 
nized social order. Each gremlin knows who is above him in so¬ 
cial rank, and who is below. As a rule, this is ordered by hit 
points, but an aggressive gremlin with lower hit points may be 
above larger gremlins in the social standing. Males and females 
are indistinguishable to all but other gremlins, Both sexes partici¬ 
pate equally in all things, Offspring are left to fend for them¬ 
selves from birth, which they are fully capable of doing. Within a 
month, the gremlin is a fully matured adult. Fortunately, they do 
not mate often. 

These obnoxious creatures usually look for a building or estate 


to infest. Although they flee individual combat, they will not 
leave the building or grounds they infest until it is no longer fun 
(when everything is broken and the inhabitants have fled), or un¬ 
til their lives are in danger. Since the gremlins take great pains to 
not be seen, except as fleeting shadows, the inhabitants are fre¬ 
quently convinced that the place is haunted. 

Ecology: Gremlins are not a natural part of the ecology* Their 
immunity to normal weapons protects them from normal preda¬ 
tors. Unmolested* they live for centuries. 

Fremlin 

These friendly gremlins are quite harmless, They tend to be 
plump, w'hiny, and lazy, but otherwise look like small, slate col¬ 
ored gremlins* Occasionally, they become tolerable companions, 
if they take a liking to someone and are well fed and entertained. 
Even in this case* they never assist in combat and may in fact 
hinder it by giving away the location of hiding characters or 
making other such blunders. 

Galltrit 

These nasty little stone-gray creatures live in areas of dung, carri¬ 
on, or offal. Because of their small size and coloration, they are 
detected only on a 1 in 8 chance (1 in 6 for elves). They attack 
anything that disturbs them. Galltrit attempt to gain surprise and 
bite (with a +3 bonus to the attack roll if they have surprise) 
somewhere unobtrusive. An anesthetic in their saliva prevents 
their victims from Feeling the bite, rather like a vampire bat. 

Once locked on, galltrits suck 1 hit point of blood per round 
for a full turn, if undisturbed. If challenged in any way, the 
galltrits flee* This loss of blood reduces the victim's Constitution 
by 1 point for every 4 hit points of blood lost. If the victim loses 3 
or more points of Constitution, usually due to multiple galltrits, 
he faints from the sudden blood loss, It takes two full turns to 
awaken and two weeks to regain the lost Constitution points. 

Mite 

Mites are tiny* mischievous, wingless gremlins that waylay 
dungeon adventurers for fun and profit. Mites have hairless, 
warty skin varying in color from light gray to bright violet. Their 
heads are triangular* with bat-like ears and a long, hooked nose.

Gremlin 


Male mites sport a bone ridge down the center of their skulls and 
short goatee beards. Many wear filthy rags stolen from previous 
victims. Their voices are high-pitched and twittery, conveying 
only the simplest ideas to each other; nongremlin races cannot 
make sense of their language. 

Mites try to catch lone travelers and stragglers using pit traps 
(ld6 points of damage to the victim), nets (successful saving 
throw vs. paralysis or the victim is caught), and trip wires (suc¬ 
cessful Dexterity check or the victim falls prone). Mites swarm 
over prone or netted victims, and pummel them with weighted 
clubs (2% cumulative chance, per dub, of stunning the victim, 
but only if the victim is in armor worse than splint mail). The 
mites bind their unconscious victims head and foot, and drag 
them into their lair. Once inside the lair, the victims are teased 
and chattered at for one to four days until the mites get bored. 
The mites then stun their victim again, steal all their possessions 
and deposit them at a random place—often one that causes the 
victims great discomfort or embarrassment. 

Mite lairs consist of dozens of interconnecting corridors built 
above and below main dungeon corridors. Numerous entrances 
connect the mite tunnels to the dungeon, but all are hidden by 
carefully placed stones (check for secret doors to find a mite tun¬ 
nel entrance). Mite corridors are tiny by human and detnl-human 
standards; man-sized and larger creatures suffer a -4 attack roll 
penalty and a +4 Armor Class penalty when fighting in a mite 
tunnel. 

Mites are small and quick* They scurry to and fro through 
their tunnels, stopping briefly to spy on the main tunnel, always 
chattering and twittering to themselves* 

Deep inside the mite tunnel system is a single, large chamber 
with a Jow-cdling. The mite king lives here. Sitting on his tiny 
throne, dressed in baggy clothes stolen from previous victims. 
The mite king is a fierce (by mite standards) warrior with 1 + i 
Hit Dice, His bite causes ld4 points of damage. Also in the cham¬ 
ber are 4db mite females and 4d6 mite children. The women have 
1-2 Hit Dice and bite for 1-2 points of damage* The children are 
non-combatants. 

The chamber itself is filthy and strewn with captured weapons, 
armor, and dothes. Coins and such are carelessly thrown about, 
but mites love bright, shiny gems. These are kept by the king, 
who is allowed to play with them anytime he wants. Mites are 
mischievous and curious. They pore for hours over every little 
stolen item, poking and prodding, bending and tasting, until ei¬ 
ther they grow bored, or, more likely, the item breaks. They de¬ 
light in wearing dothes several dozen sizes too large. Mites are 
fond of bones, and they sometimes drag the skulls of great mon¬ 
sters into their lair. 

Mites hunt vermin and other pests, but they love to eat iron 
rations which they consider a delicacy. Mites are viewed as bite- 
sized snacks by most monsters. Evil giants sometimes feature 
them as appetizers. 



Snyads speak no known language but seem Lo communicate 
with mites successfully. These two creatures sometimes team up, 
with the mites distracting the victim, while the snyads dari in and 
grab things. 

Snyads steal with great skill, surprising their targets 90% of 
the time, often snatching items directly from a person s hand (the 
victim gets a successful Wisdom check to hold onto the item), 
then zipping back into their holes and hiding until the pursuers 
leave, Spotting the entrance to a snyad lair requires a successful 
search roll; a 1 -in-3 chance for elves and a l-in-4 chance for all 
others. 

Snyads never attack, relying on their amazingly quick reflexes 
to escape combat. They are not particularly strong, and any hu¬ 
man or demi-human character with a Strength greater than 11 
can capture a snyad with a successful attack roll. Captured sny¬ 
ads kick and scream, squirming and twisting to get away, but 
never bite, (for fear that the captor might bite back), Because ot 
their high Dexterity, snyads gain a +3 bonus to their saving 
throws vs. non-area-effect spells. Snyads live in immediate fami¬ 
lies, marrying for life. 


Sityad 

Snyads are distant relatives of mites. Their love oi treasure otten 
compels them to steal from humans and demihumans. Snyads 
resemble mites, but they are slightly larger (2 l h feet tall), have 
hill, though messy, heads of hair, and are light brown in color.

Jermlaine are a diminutive humanoid race that dwells in tunnels 
and ambushes hapless adventurers. They are known by a variety 
of names such as jinxkin or bane-midges. 

Jermlaine appear to be tiny humans dressed in baggy clothing 
and leather helmets. In fact the “clothing"' is their own saggy skin 
and pointed heads. The limbs are knottily muscled. The finger¬ 
nails and toenails are thick and filthy, although the fingers and 
toes are very nimble. Their gray-brown, warty hide blends in 
with natural earth and stone. When they wear rags or scraps as 
clothing, such items are also camouflage colored. 

They speak in high-pitched squeaks and twitters. This speech 
may be mistaken for the sounds of a bat or rat. They can also 
converse with all sorts of rats, both normal and monstrous. Each 
jermlaine has a 10% chance to understand common, dwarvish, 
gnomish, goblin, or ore (roll separately for each language). 

Combafc Termlaine are cowards who have made an art of the 
ambush. They only attack when they feel there is no serious op¬ 
position. They prefer to attack injured, ill, or sleeping victims. 
They avoid directly confronting strong, alert parlies, although 
they may try to injure them out of sheer maliciousness. Jermlaine 
possess weak eyes and infravision that only extends for 30 yards, 
but their keen smell and hearing enable them to detect even invis¬ 
ible creatures 50% of the Lime. 1 ermlaine move silently and 
quickly with a scuttling gait (this stealth causes opponents to suf¬ 
fer a -5 penalty to their surprise rolls). They arc 75% undetect¬ 
able, even If listened or watched for, unless the jermlaine 
purposefully reveal their presence. 

jermlaine typically arm themselves with needle-sharp darts; 
they can hurl these 120 yards for 1-2 points of damage. They also 
carry a miniature pike; these l 1 .^-foot-long sticks with sharp tips 
inflict ld4 points of damage. If the jermlames are out to capture a 
victim, they are also armed with blackjacks. 

The jermlames 1 favorite tactic is capturing victims with nets or 
pits. In lit tie-used passages the creatures prepare pits covered by 
camouflaged doors or string nets overhead. In more-traveled 
passages, the jermlaine stretch trip cords. When a victim falls 
afoul of a trap, the jermlaine swarm over him. Some pummel 
him with blackjacks while others tie him with ropes and cords. 



Such beatings have a cumulative 2% chance per blow of causing 
the victim to lapse into unconsciousness. If a victim is wearing 
splint, banded, or plate mail, these pummeling attacks are inef¬ 
fective. Knowing this, the jermlaine attack well-armored victims 
with add or flaming oil missiles. 

Slam victims and 5% of subdued victims are later devoured by 
the jermlaine and their rats Most captives are robbed, stripped, 
shaved totally hairless, and left trussed in a passageway. If an 
unsuspecting victim pauses near a lurking band of jermlaine, 
they dart out and cut straps, belts, packs, and pouches. Each 
jermlaine in the band makes one such attack before fleeing back 
into the shadows. Such attacks are usually not noticed til] ldl2 
turns later, when the slashed items begin to fall apart. They also 
try to steal, damage, or befoul victims' possessions. 

When encountered, 25% of jermlaine are accompanied by Ido 
rats and 50% are accompanied by ld6 giant rats (only one type 
of rat per group of jermlaine). Groups of 35 or more jermlaine are 
accompanied by an elder—a very old jermlaine with the magical 
ability to drain the magic from most magical items if he can han¬ 
dle such an object for ld4 rounds. Artifacts and relics are im¬ 
mune to such attacks. 

lermlaine are treated as 4-Hit Die monsters for purposes of 
saving throws and magical attacks. Due to their diminutive size, 
they escape all damage from attacks that normally do half dam¬ 
age if the saving throw is successful. 

Habitat/Society: jermlaine are extremely distant relatives of the 
gnomes. Their deeply rooted sense of inferiority at their own di¬ 
minutive size has become a malicious need to humiliate normal¬ 
sized humanoids. They make a good living preying on hapless 
adventurers, who provide riches, sadistic amusement, and an oc¬ 
casional meal. Jermlaine acquire a wide variety of treasure, al¬ 
though such items tend to be small objects. 

The jermlaine life span is one third that of humans. Reproduc¬ 
tion is identical to other humanoids, although cross breeding is 
impossible, Jermlaine females give birth to one or two babies at a 
time. Most (75%) of the offspring are male, although the dangers 


176 






Gremlin, lermlaine 


of their hostile life reduces the male numerical superiority to an 
even male-female mix among the adults. 

lermlaine society is divided among dans whose members are 
united by blood. Each dan consists of 4d4 families. The dan 
chief is normally the strongest or most clever of the elders. The 
chief both instructs the young jermlaine in the arl of the ambush 
and leads important attacks (albeit from a secure location in the 
rear). The families center around the mothers, as the fathers may 
be unknown, off hunting, or dead. If a female jermlaine has de¬ 
pendent children, she normally concentrates on raising such chil¬ 
dren rather than participating in attacks. As the children mature, 
she and the clan chief take the young on practice attacks on po¬ 
tential victims and participate in the humiliation of captives. 

Jermlaine lairs are cunningly hidden and physically impassable 
by most humanoids, as they are usually a series of small chambers 
and tunnels scaled to their tiny occupants. The typical jermlaine 
lair is a filthy cave or burrow a short distance from a larger cavern 
complex The only areas that can be easily reached by a human¬ 
sized being are the areas in which living captives are held and dead 
victims butchered for food. Access past this area is controlled by 
small, one-foot-high corridors or thin, normally impassable cracks 
in the rock walls. The corridors lead directly to living areas and 
communal chambers. The living areas are furnished with crude 
furniture and items scavenged from past victims. 

Each jermlaine family has a personal section that half resem¬ 
bles a nest, half a junk yard. Treasures are concealed throughout 
the lair. Each family maintains a series of small, personal caches, 
while the communal hoard is hidden in a series of small chambers 
at the end of cunningly concealed crawl ways. No one larger than 
a jermlaine can reach such treasure chambers, 

Jermlaine get along well with rats of all types. They can speak 
all rat-related languages. They are 75% likely to be accompanied 
by rats and 50% likely to share their lair with rats. This cohabita¬ 
tion extends to all forms of mutual cooperation and defense. 
There is a 10% chance that the jermlaine colony has a mutual 
cooperation pact with osquips rather than normal rats. 


The diet is an omnivorous mixture of Insects, fresh meat, carri¬ 
on, fungi, and molds. Humanoids are a delicacy reserved for spe¬ 
cial occasions. Lizards form the bulk of the meat intake, 
Jermlaine cherish foods from the surface, even the hardtack and 
iron rations carried by adventurers. If the jermlaine can identify 
which oi the adventurers* bags carry food, these are stolen as en¬ 
thusiastically as the treasure pouches, Jermlaine have a fondness 
for rarities such as sugar candy, and preserved fruits. Such items 
can be used to entice the normally malevolent jermlaine to leave 
an adventurer alone, at least temporarily. 

Ecology: lermlaine are opportunistic brigands who prey on un¬ 
wary travelers in the subterranean regions. They are well aware 
of any such travelers, including a party's size, composition, and 
general condition. Jermlaine may be persuaded, for a suitable 
fee, to share such knowledge with adventurers. 

Jermlaine may deal with "giants" (any race bigger than they 
are) if they are bribed or given access to a plentiful flow of vic¬ 
tims or riches. They never ally themselves with truly good- 
aligned adventurers, although they may, in a moment of 
craftiness, pretend to enter such an alliance. Regardless of their 
spoken intentions, 75% of jermlaine eventually either lie to or 
turn against their larger '"allies " They may make their lairs near 
the established territories of such races as drow, trolls, or troglo¬ 
dytes. Although they are careful to avoid direct conflict with 
such evil beings, the jermlaine happily prey on the victims of 
their neighbors, as well as scavenging the scenes of their neigh¬ 
bors' battles, Jermlaine may act as watchmen for their neighbors, 
provided suitable terms can be agreed upon. 

They unintentionally act as garbagemen, cleaning the subter¬ 
ranean regions. Dead animals may be used as food or supplies, 
while dead humanoids are taken away to be searched for valu¬ 
ables or used as food. Because of this, adventurers seeking the 
remains of a slain companion may seek out the local jermlaines 
since they may be aware of where the remains are located.

Half-lion, half-eagle, griffons are ferocious avian carnivores that 
prey upon horses and their kin (hippogriffs, pegasi, and uni- 
corns i. This hunger for horseflesh often brings griffons into di¬ 
rect conflict with humans and demi humans. 

Adult griffons stand five feet at the shoulder and weigh over 
half a ton. Their head, upper torso, and forelegs are like those of 
a giant eagle. This eagle half is covered in golden feathers from its 
wing tips to its razor-sharp beak. Their powerful foreiimbs end 
in long, hooked talons. Wings* with a span of 25 feet or more, 
rise out of their backs. The lower half of a griffon is that of a lion. 
Dusky yellow lur covers the lion half s muscular rear legs and 
clawed feet. A lions tail hangs down from the griffon's powerful 
rear haunches. Griffons speak no languages, but emit an eagle¬ 
like screech when angered or excited (usually by the smell of 
horse). 

Combat: Griffons hunt in groups of 12 or less, searching the 
plains and forests near (within 20 miles) their lair for horses and 
herd animals. With their superior vision and sense of smell, grif¬ 
fons can spot prey up to two miles distant. If the prey is horse or 
horse-kin, griffons are 90% likely to attack even if the horses 
have riders. Griffons hunt only for food, so a rider who releases 
one or two horses can usually escape unharmed fthough in all 
likelihood his horse wont). Any attempt to protect a horse 
brings the full fury of the attacking griffons on the protector. 

When attacking ground targets, griffons use their great size 
and weight to swoop down from above and raking their oppo¬ 
nent with the talons before landing nearby. Griffons always fight 
to the death if there is horsellesh at stake. 

In aerial combat, griffons are equally fierce, lunging into battle 
and tearing at their opponent until they or their prey are dead. 
Many a griffon has plummeted to its death with a struggling hip- 
pogriff caught firmly in its grasp, 

Habitat/Sodety: Griffons prefer rocky habitats, near open 
plains. Once griffons establish their territory, they remain until 
the food supply has been exhausted. 



Griffons, like lions, live in prides, with each pride comprising 
several mated pairs, their young, and one dominant male. The 
dominant mate is responsible for settling territorial disputes with 
other prides and choosing the direction the hunt w ill take. 

Each pair of mated griffons in the pride has its own nest, lo¬ 
cated near the prides other lairs. Griffon nests are usually situ¬ 
ated in shallow' caves* high along a cliff face. 

The nests are made of sticks and leaves, as well as an occasion¬ 
al bone, Griffons collect no treasure, but their caves frequently 
contain the remains of unfortunate travelers who tried to protect 
their horses from the grill ons. 

During spring* female griffons lay one or two eggs that hatch 
in the late summer. For the first three months griffon young are 
known as hatchlings; thereafter, until they mature the young are 
called fledglings. Griffon young grow rapidly for three years un¬ 
til they are large enough to hunt with the pride. Adult griffons 
are extremely protective oi their young and attack without mercy 
any creature that approaches within 100 feet of the nest. 

Ecology: If trained from a very early age (three years or less), 
griffons will serve as mounts. The training, however, is both 
time-consuming and expensive, requiring the expertise of an ani¬ 
mal trainer for two years. Once trained, though, griffons make 
f ierce and loyal steeds, bonding with one master for life, and pro¬ 
tecting him even unto death, A griffon mount knows no fear in 
battle, but attacks any horse or horse-kin in preference to other 
opponents. 

Acquiring a griffon fledgling is a very dangerous venture as the 
adults never stray far from the nest and fight to the death to de¬ 
fend eggs or young. Any given griffon nest is 75% likely to con¬ 
tain one or two fledglings or eggs. Fledgling griffons sell for 5,000 
gold pieces on the open market; eggs sell for 2,000 gold pieces 
each.

Powerfully-built humanoids dad only in dark, filthy rags, these 
warlike subterranean creatures emerge from their deep caverns at 
night to search for unlucky humans to add to their larders, 

Grimlocks have thick, scaly, grey skirt and long, black, filthy 
hair. Their teeth are white and extremely sharp. Their eyes are 
blank white orbs, 

Grimlocks are totally blind, but have highly developed senses 
of smell and hearing. Their sensitive ears and noses combine to 
allow them to distinguish objects and creatures within 20just as 
well as if they were able to see. 

Combat; Grimlocks are immune to the effects of spells which af¬ 
fect the vision. These include p haniasmal force. darkness , invisi¬ 
bility. mirror image r and many others. However, spells such as 
audible glarner or any loud, continuous noise will partially 
blind' them. This reduces their ability to perceive opponents to 
a 10 r range and makes them -2 on their attack rolls. Substances 
such as snuff or strong perfumes will have much the same effect if 
inhaled by a grimlock or thrown in its face. 

Grimlocks attack fiercely but with little or no organization, 
often stopping in the middle of battle to carry off fallen foes or 
comrades for food. For every 10 grimlocks encountered, there 
will be a leader of 3 Hit Dice and AC 4, for every 40 there will be 
a champion of 4 Hit Dice and AC 3. These exceptional individ¬ 
uals will usually be the only ones to show even the most elemen¬ 
tal strategy, usually by allowing their followers to weaken 
opponents before entering battle themselves. 

Grimlocks will nearly always attack m darkness if possible. 
While not adversely affected by light, they are intelligent enough 
to realize that in total darkness, their unique form of perception 
gives them a distinct advantage. 

Though able to attack with their hands (for 1-6 hp damage), 
grimlocks prefer edged weapons and will usually (90% chance) 
be armed as follows: hand-axe, 20%; battle-axe, 15%; two* 
handed sword, 15%; bastard sword, 15%; broad sword, 15%; 
long sword, 20%. 

Leaders or champions will always be armed with a battle-axe 
or two-handed sword. 

Grimlocks, whether normal, leader, or champion, make all 
saving throws as oth-level fighters. Grimlocks gain a +1 on sur¬ 



prise rolls, since their acute hearing allows them to communicate 
in voices too faint for other races to hear. In addition, their mo¬ 
rale Is raised by 1 for every leader or champion with the group. 

Habitat Society: Grimlocks lair in vast cavern complexes in 
mountainous areas. They are well adapted to these environs. In 
any rocky terrain they blend in so well that, while motionless, 
they are completely undetectable—unless one actually bumps in¬ 
to them. In any grimlock lair, there will be nearly as many fe¬ 
males (1 Hit Die and AC 6) as males, and at least as many young 
(1 hit point, AC 6 and non-combatant), Grimlock leaders and 
champions do wield some control over these communities. How¬ 
ever, this control is usually effective only as long as the leader 
who gave the order is around to enforce his will. It is nearly im¬ 
possible for those of other races to tell one grimlock from 
another—although leader types may appear slightly larger—but 
they easily tell each other apart by subtle differences in scent and 
movement. 

Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks rarely consort with other 
races. However, there is a small (10%) chance that they will al¬ 
low medusae to share their lairs, and a 2 % chance that any wan¬ 
dering group will be accompanied by 1-2 mind flayers. 

Ecology: Grimlocks will only eat the raw flesh of humanoid crea¬ 
tures, vastly preferring that of humans to all others. Foraging 
parties often raid the homes of oLher subterranean races, espe¬ 
cially those who keep large slave populations (such as drow). 
They are often on good terms with mind flayers since illithids 
have a large supply of humanoid bodies discarded after they 
have devoured the brains, Grimlocks are particularly hated by 
githyanki for this reason. Since the slave flesh the grimlocks of¬ 
ten consume (raw) is frequently unwholesome, whole communi¬ 
ties are often decimated by disease.

Grippli resemble smalt intelligent, humanoid tree frogs. They 
are have a primitive culture and are nonaggressive. 

They stand 2- ^ feet tall and weigh 25 to 30 pounds. Their 
bodies are shaped like those of frogs, except for the human-like 
hands and hand-like feet. Their eyes are yellow with vertical slit 
pupils. Their skin is gray-green with camouflage stripes and 
swirling patterns. Although their skin looks wet and shiny, it is 
actually dry to the touch. Grippli smell of old, wet vegetation* 

They love bright colors and eagerly acquire any such items. 
They wear clothing only for decoration or for a particular func¬ 
tional purpose, such as for pockets. A normal encounter with 
grippli outside of the village finds them wearing only thin belts or 
loin doths to hold weapons or acquired items. 

They speak a language of croaks, groans, dicks, and 
squeaks. In a tribe there is usually at least one member that can 
speak either common, elvish, or some other jungle humanoids' 
language. When speaking any language but their own, they are 
barely understandable because of the croaking resonances in 
their speech, 

Combat: Because of the grippli's coloring, opponents suffer a 
" 3 penalty to their surprise rolls. Grippli defend themselves with 
snares, nets, poisoned darts, and the occasional sword or dagger. 
Any metal weapons must be manufactured elsewhere for the 
grippli, so swords are rare. They can adapt to use any weapons, 
and they have been known to use spears and blow guns on rare 
occasions. They never wear armor. Generally speaking the grip¬ 
pli prefer small weapons that don't get in the way of climbing, 

A grippli can dimb trees or non-sheer rock at its normal move¬ 
ment rate, thanks to its unusual hands and feet. When keeping 
still among vegetation, a gripplfs natural camouflage causes a - 
3 penalty to its opponents' surprise rolls. They have infravision 
good up to 10 yards, which means they can operate at night al¬ 
most as well as during the day. 

They are very capable of formulating strategies and tactics to 
overcome a larger, more powerful force, Grippli prefer ambushes 
and traps to most other strategies* By trapping their opponents in 
snares and nets, they can hurl darts at them safely from high in 
the trees. If unprovoked, they attack only to steal various bright¬ 
ly colored baubles. 



Habitat/Society: A grippli tribal village is made of small huts of 
wood and mud built on the ground, in the deep shadows of large 
trees. On rare occasions, a grippli village is found in the strong 
limbs of the trees. Each village is led by a tribe mother (AC 7, HD 
3, Xd6 + 1 points of damage with a weapon). Once per day the 
tribe mother can emit a musk cloud, which is treated as a stinking 
cloud spell. She looks like any other grippli, except for being al¬ 
most four feet tall. She has ld3 mates of larger than normal size 
(AC 8, HD 2. Id4 + 1 points of damage with poisoned weapons), 
standing three to three-and-a-half feet tall. The tribe mother is 
supposed to have a touch of the blood of their god in her. 

A typical village has 5d6 males capable of defending it* There 
are an equal number of noncombatant females and ld6 offspring, 
also noncombatants. They have basic family units, just like hu¬ 
mans, and each family has its own hut. The tribe mothers hut 
doubles as a temple to their small, frog-like deity. Other deities in 
the pantheon include evil snake gods and spider goddesses* 

Their natural high intelligence enables them to learn new de¬ 
vices and weapons quickly and easily. As a race they have no 
desire to manufacture such items themselves. However, they will 
trade tor them with other races. Trade items usually include rare 
fruits or other hard-to-get jungle specimens. They are extremely 
cautious and only develop trade relations with groups that they 
trust completely such as good elves or the rare village ot good 
humans in their area. 

Ecology: Grippli s eat fruit and insects. They trap small insects 
in large quantities and hunt the giant varieties like humans hunt 
stags. They are in turn hunted by most large, ground- and tree- 
based predators. Giant snakes and spiders in particular are fond 
oi grippli as meals, 

Grippli are rare in the world, mostly because of their low 
birthrate. They live to be 700 years old, but give birth to only six 
or so young in that time. Because of this, the grippli defend their 
young ferociously.

Hags are witch-like beings that spread havoc and destruction, 
working their magics, and slaying all whom they encounter. 

Hags appear as wretched old women, with long, frayed hair, and 
withered faces. Horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, their 
mouths are filled with blackened teeth, and their breath is most foul. 
Though wrinkled and skinny, hags possess supernatural strength 
and can easily crush smaller creatures, such as goblins, with one 
hand. Similarly though hags look decrepit, they run swiftly easily 
bounding over rocks or logs in their path. From the long, skinny 
fingers of hags grow iron-like daws, Hags use these daws (and their 
supernatural strength) to rend and tear at opponents in combat. 
Their garb is similar to that of peasant women, but usually much 
more tattered and filthy 

Combat: The combat abilities of hags vary with each type (see 
below for details), but all hags possess the following: 18/00 
Strength or greater, some level of magic resistance, and the spell- 
like ability to change self at will. Hags use this last ability to at- 
tract victims, frequently posing as young human or demihuman 
females, helpless old women, or occasionally as ores or hobgob¬ 
lins. A disguised hag reveals her true form and leaps to the attack 
when weak opponents come near. Against well armed and ar¬ 
mored parties, hags maintain their disguise and employ further 
trickery designed to place the intended victim in a more vulnera¬ 
ble position. This trickery can take any of several forms, includ¬ 
ing verbal persuasion, leading the victim into a prearranged trap, 
and so on. 

The one weakness of hags is their arrogance. Hags have great dis¬ 
dain for the mental abilities of all humans and demihumans and, 
though hags are masterful employers of disguise, clever characters 
may be able to glean a hag's true nature through conversation. 

Habitat. Society: Hags live alone or in coveys of three. They al¬ 
ways choose desolate, out-ot-the-way places in which to dwell. 
They sometimes coexist with ogres or evil giants. The former act 
as servants or guards for hags, but giants are treated with respect 
(for obvious reasons) and often cooperate with hags to accom¬ 
plish acts of great evil against the outside world. 

While individually powerful, hags are much more dangerous 
when formed into a covey. A covey is composed of three hags of any 
combination (e,g., two annis and a green hag, three annis, etc.). 
Coveys have special powers that individual hags don't possess. 


These powers include the fallowing spells: curse, polymorph other, 
animate dead , dream, control weather, veil forcecage. vision , and 
mind blank . Covey spells can each be used once per day, and take 
effect as if they were cast by a 9th-levd spellcastcr. To cast one of 
these spells, the members of the covey must all be within TO feet of 
each other and the spell being cast must be in lieu of all other attacks. 

Coveys never cast these spells in combat, instead these spells 
are used to help weave wicked plots against neighboring human 
or demihuman settlements. A common ploy by coveys is to force 
or trick a victim into performing some heinous deed. This deed 
usually involves bringing back more victims, some of whom are 
devoured by the hags: the rest are used on Further evil assign¬ 
ments. Any creature fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to resist a 
covey is immediately devoured. 

A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by a mixture of 
ld8 ogres and ld4 evil giants, Coveys often use one or two of 
their ogres as spies, sending them into the world beyond after 
poly morphing them into less threatening creatures. 

These minions frequently (60%) wear a special magical gem called 
a hag eye. A hag eye is made from the real eye of a covey's previous 
victim. It appears to the casual observer to be no more than a low- 
value gem (20 gp or less), but if viewed through a gem of true seeing , 
a disembodied eye can be seen trapped in the hag eves interior. This 
hidden eye is magically connected to the covey that created the hag 
eye. All three members of the covey can see whatever the hag eye is 
pointed at. Hag eyes are usually placed on a medallion or brooch 
worn by one of the hags polymorphed servants. Occasionally hag 
eyes are given as gifts to unsuspecting victims whom the hags want 
to monitor. Destroying a hag eye inflicts Id 10 points of damage to 
each member of the covey that created it, and one of the three hags is 
struck blind for 24 hours. 

Hags commonly inhabit bone-strewn glens deep within for¬ 
ests. There is an 80% chance that hags are keeping one or two 
captives in a nearby earthen pit or forcecage. These prisoners are 
held for a purpose known only to the hags themselves, though it 
will certainly involve spreading chaos into the outside world. 
Prisoners kept in a pit are guarded by an evil giant or one to two 
ogres; those in a forcecage are lefL alone. 

Ecology: Hags have a ravenous appetite and are able to devour 
man-sized creatures in just 10 rounds. They prefer human flesh, but 
settle for ore or demihuman when necessary. This wanton destruc- 


18 





tion has earned hags some powerful enemies. Besides humanity in 
general, both good giants and good dragons hunt hags, slaying them 
whenever possible. Still hags multiply rapidly by using their 
change self ability to appear as beautiful maidens to men they en¬ 
counter alone. Hag offspring are always female. Legends say that 
hags can change their unborn child for that of a human female while 
she sleeps. They further state that any mother who brings such a 
child to term Is then slain by the hag-child she carries. Fortunately, 
such ghastly tales have never been proven. 

Hags hoard tine treasure, using the jewelry and coins to deco¬ 
rate the bones of their more powerful victims, and the finer gems 
(500 gp value or higher) to manufacture magical img eyes. 

Annis 

The largest and most powerful of all the hags, annis stand seven 
to eight feet tail. Their skin is deep blue in complexion, while 
their hair, teeth, and nails are glossy black. The eyes of an annis 
are dull green or yellow Annis have norma] intravision (60-foot 
range), but superior hearing and sense of smell. Annis are sur¬ 
prised only on a 1 on ldlO. 

An annis attacks using its talons and teeth to inflict horrible 
wounds. In melee, annis tend to dose and grapple. An annis that 
hits an opponent with all three of its attacks in one round has 
successfully grappled its opponent. Next round, all attacks by the 
annis are automatic hits, unless the opponent is stronger, the an¬ 
nis is slam, or the victim uses some magical means to escape the 
hag. Otherwise, the annis will continue to hold the victim in its 
grasp, and deliver damage with its raking talons and sharpened 
teeth each round until the victim is slain. 

In addition to normal attacks, annis have the ability to cast fog 
cloud three times per day. This spell is used to confuse resistance 
or to delay attack by a superior foe. Annis can also change self 
like all hags, appearing as a tall human, ogre, or even a small 
giant. These spells are cast at 8th level for purposes of determin¬ 
ing spell range, duration, etc, 

The skin of an annis is iron-hard; thus edged weapons cause 1 
less point of damage when they hit these hags. Conversely, blunt 
weapons {including morning stars) cause 1 additional point of 
damage against an anms. 

Annis speak thdr own language, as well as ogre, all evil giant 
tongues, and some common. Some of the most intelligent annis 
can speak common fluently and know a smattering of various 
demihuman languages. Annis are believed to live for 500 years. 

Greenhag 

These wretched creatures live in desolate countryside and amid 
dense forests and swamps. Greenhags. as their name implies, 
have a sickly green pallor. Hair color ranges from near black to 
olive green, and their eyes are amber or orange. Their skin ap¬ 
pears withered but is hard and rough like the bark of a tree. Due 
to their coloration and their ability to move with absolute si¬ 
lence, greenhags impose a -5 penalty to an opponent's surprise 
roll when in a forest or swamp They have superior hearing, 
smell, and sight, including infravision (90-foot range). They are 
only surprised on a roll of 1 on the ldlO surprise roll. 

Rock-hard talons grow from the long, slender fingers of 
greenhags. They use these talons to slash and rend their oppo¬ 
nents. Smaller than their annis cousins, greenhags nonetheless 
possess Strength equivalen t to that of an ogre (18/00). Because of 
their great Strength, all their attack rolls gain a +3 bonus and all 
hits receive a +6 damage bonus. 

Greenhags can cast the following spells at will, one spell per 
round; audible glamor dancing lights, invisibility, pass without 
trace, change self , speak with monsters, water breathing, and 
weakness. Each spell is employed at 9th level of ability. 

To Vure victims, greenhags typically use their mimic ability. 
This enables them to imitate the voice of a mature or immature 



male or female, human or demihuman. Calls lor help and crying 
are common deceptions employed by greenhags. They are also 
able to mimic most animals. 

Greenhags speak their own language (a dialect of annis) as well 
as all demihuman languages and common. These are the longest 
lived of all hags—they can live for up to 1.000 years. 

Sea Hag 

These, the most wretched of all hags, inhabit thickly vegetated 
shallows in warm seas and, very rarely overgrown lakes. Warts, 
bony protrusions, and patches of slimy green scales dot their 
sickly yellow skin. Their eyes are always red with deep, black 
pupils T Long, seaweed-like hair hangs limply from their heads, 
covering their withered bodies. 

Sea hags hate beauty, attempting to destroy it wherever it is 
encountered. Sea hags can change self at will, and often use this 
ability to draw their victims within 30 feet before revealing them¬ 
selves, The true appearance of a sea hag is so ghastly that anyone 
viewing one of these hag;* grows weak from fright unless a suc¬ 
cessful saving throw vs. spell is rolled. Beings that fail their sav¬ 
ing throw Jose */a ot their Strength for ldb turns. Worse still, sea 
hags can cast a deadly glance up to three times a day. This look 
affects one creature of the sea hags choosing within 30 feet. To 
negate the effects of this glance, the victim must successfully save 
vs, poison. If the saving throw is failed, the victim either dies 
immediately from fright {25% chance) or falls stricken and is par¬ 
alysed for three days (75% chance). Few' who survive the glance 
live to tell of it, for sea hags quickly devour their helpless victims. 

Sea hags always use their deadly glance as their primary form 
of attack; they will melee, but only if they have the advantage of 
numbers. Unlike other hags, sea hags use daggers in combat, re¬ 
ceiving a +3 bonus to their attack roll and a +6 damage bonus, 
due to their ogre-like Strength. 

Sea hags speak their own language as well as common and the 
languages of annis, and sea elves, and live for 800 years.

Halflings are a hard-working race of peaceful citizens* Their communities 
are similar to those of humans, although they usually contain many bur¬ 
row homes in addition to surface cottages. 

Half!mgs average 3 feet in height, have ruddy completions, with sandy 
to dark brown hair, and blue or hazel eyes. Their dress is often colorful 
but serviceable, and they like to wear caps or tunics. In addition to their 
own language, many halflings also speak the common tongue, gnome, 
goblin, and ortish. 

Combat; Halflings will fight with great ferocity in defense of good or 
their homes. They are very skilled with both the sling and the bow {re¬ 
ceiving a +3 bonus on all attack rolls) and use these weapons to great 
advantage in battle- Their tactics often involve feints to draw their at¬ 
tackers into the open where they can be subjected to a volley of fire from 
cover. 

When equipped for battle halflings wear padded or leather armor. A half- 
ling force b usually armed with short swords and hand axes. In addition, two- 
thirds of the halflings will be carrying either a sling or short bow. 

All halflings above normal level will have Armor Class 6, while those of 
3rd or 4th level wear chain mail over their leather ( AC 4). Higher level half- 
lings have a 10 percent chance per level of having a magic weapon or armor. 

As all halflings are naturally resistant to magic and poisons—they save 
at 4 levels above their actual level In addition, half lings are exceedingly 
clever at quiet movement and hiding. In combat, their opponents receive 
a -5 on their surprise roll. In natural terrain halflings are considered irmrs- 
ible w T hen they arc hiding in vegetation. 

Habitat Society: Halfling villages will generally have between 30 and 300 
(30dl0t individuals living in them. For every 30 halfling* in a particular 
community there will be two 2nd-level fighters and a 3rd-level priest. If 
more than 90 halflings are encountered there will be an additional leader 
of 3rd-level fighting ability. If more than 150 are encountered there will 
also be the following additional haflling warriors in the group; one 9th- 
lcvel fighter, two 4th-level fighters and three 3rd-level fighters. Further a 
community of 150 halflings will have a Sth-level priest. 

Cheerful and outgoing, halflings, take great pleasure in simple crafts 
and nature. Their fingers, though short, are very dexterous allowing 
them to create objects of great beauty. Halflings shun water and extremes 
in temperature*, preferring to settle in temperate pastoral countrysides. 

They get along well with humans and receive a +2 bonus to all their 
Reaction Rolls involving human NPCs 

Ecology: Halflings hunt occasionally, but prefer breads, vegetables and 
fruits, with an occasional pheasant on the side. They have a life expectan¬ 
cy of 100 years on the average. 

Tall fellow 

A taller 14' + ) and slimmer haJfhng with fair skin and hair, tallfellows are 
somewhat rare among the halfling folk, Tallfellows generally speak the 
language of elves* in addition to those listed previously and greatly enjoy 
their company. In combat, tallfellows often ride pontes and carry- spears 

i S3 


or small lances. Tallfellows of strength 17 or more can rise In 6th level 
fighting ability. They live ISO years on average. Like elves, a tallfdlow 
can recognize a secret door on a roll of Iona Ido, All tall fellows receive a 
+ 2 bonus to surprise rolls when in forest or wooded terrain. 

Stout 

These- halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common hairfoots. 
Stouts take great pleasure In gems and fine masonry, often work ing as jewel¬ 
ers or stone cutlers. They rarely mix with humans and elves, but enjoy the 
company of dwarves and often speak their language fluently, Like dwarves, 
stouts have mfravision (60"), a 75% chance to detect sloping passageways, 
and a 50% chance of determining direction when underground. Stouts with a 
strength score of 17 or better can work their way up to the Qlh-levd of fight¬ 
ing ability. Their ties with the dwarven folk have spilled over into their com¬ 
bat tactics, with many stouts employing hammers and momingstars in 
combat. Stouts also have no fear of water and, in fact, many are excellent 
swimmers, Stouts, can reach an age of 140 or more years.

Harpies are wicked avian beasts that prey upon nearly all crea¬ 
tures but prefer the flesh of humans and dermhumans. 

Harpies have the bodies of vultures but the upper torsos and 
heads of women. Their human features are youthful, but hid¬ 
eous. with frayed unkempt hair and decaying teeth. A foul odor 
surrounds all harpies and that which they touch. Harpies never 
bathe nor clean themselves in any way Their dress, if anything, 
is limited to tattered rags and shiny trinkets taken from previous 
victims. 

The language of harpies, in contrast to their enticing song, is a 
horrible collection of cackles and shrieks. Although there are in¬ 
stances of harpies which could speak the languages of other crea¬ 
tures, these are few and far between . 

Combat: The song of the harpies has the ability to charm all 
humans and demihumans who hear it (elves are resistant to the 
charm). Those who fail their saving throw versus spell will pro¬ 
ceed towards the harpy with all possible speed, only to stand en¬ 
tranced while the harpy slays them at its leisure. This charm will 
last as long as the harpy continues to sing. Harpies can sing even 
while engaged in melee. 

It is impossible to fend off a harpv song simply by clasping 
hands over ears because the charm takes effect the moment the 
first note is heard. Characters making prior preparations to block 
out the sound, [wax in ears, etcj. are immune to the effects of the 
song. In addition, characters who make their saving throw are 
thereafter immune to its effect, until such time as they encounter 
a different group of harpies. 

If forced to fight, harpies can do so quite effectively by deliver¬ 
ing a vicious bite and raking simultaneously with their talons. 
About 50% of all harpies encountered will use weapons, usually 
a bone club (damage 1-8) which they wield surprisingly well. 

The touch of a harpy upon a charmed individual has a similar, 
though somewhat less potent, effect. Those who are touched and 
miss their saving throw versus spell will stand mesmerized for 
20 + ldl0 hours. 

The effect of either charm is broken if the harpy is slain. 

Habitat Society: Harpies make their home upon coastlines in 
regions near shipping lanes and by well-traveled paths. There 
they use their song to lure travelers to their doom, 



Their lair is usually a shallow cave, which they defile until no 
animal dare approach it. Here they remain unless hunting. Har¬ 
pies often carry victims back to their lair to devour them In more 
familiar surroundings. 

Harpies have little use for treasure, other than the shiny bau¬ 
bles which they often attach to their clothes. Other items, such as 
gold and weapons, are frequently interspersed amongst the filth 
and bones that litter the cave. This refuse can reach a depth of 
several feet in the oldest of harpy lairs. 

A typical harpy lair houses about a half-dozen of these wretch¬ 
ed creatures. No male harpies have ever been seen and it seems 
that harpies can reproduce at will by laying a single egg every 
other year. Harpies take no care of their young, which live off 
carcasses and cave vermin until they themselves are old enough 
to sing and hunt. 

Harpies have no social structure, frequently quarreling over 
who gets what part of a victim and when to stop the torturing 
and start the feasting. Occasionally these quarrels will turn vio¬ 
lent, so that more than one harpy feast has begun with the last 
minute addition of the losing harpy to the menu. 

Harpies will occassionally agree to cooperate in evU acts with 
other humanoids. 

Ecology: Harpies hunt all manner of beasts, remaining in an 
area for as long as the food supply lasts. They are despised and 
greatly feared by all creatures weaker than themselves. 

Harpies have a voracious appetite, devouring all manner of 
man and beast. They take great delight in torture, and frequently 
kill for pleasure. Slain victims which harpies do not eat are sim¬ 
ply left to rot. 

Their life span is unknown but seems to be about 50 years.

Hatori, sometimes called the ' crocodiles of the sands" are giant 
reptiles dwelling within sandy desert wastes. The baton's hard, 
knobby hide ranges in color from gray-white to red-brown and is 
virtually indistinguishable from stone, Hatori use this semblance 
to great advantage, allowing the wind to partially bury them be¬ 
neath the sands so that a casual observer may believe he is look¬ 
ing at rock outcroppings instead of behemoths of the sands. 

Hatori are shaped like overgrown lizards, save that their legs 
have evolved into flat, flipper-like appendages that they use in 
conjunction with their massive tails to "swim" through the sands 
with astonishing speed and mobility. When forced to travel upon 
something more solid, such as a rocky plain, hatori move by 
awkwardly flopping and dragging themselves forward. Hatori 
eyes are normally concealed deep within dark recesses that look 
like small hollows. In the case of greater hatori (6 HD and over) 
these recesses sometimes look like cavern entrances. 

Greater hatori are identical to lesser hatori in all respects save 
size and their ability to swallow larger prey whole (see below). 

Combat: The only thing that can drive hatori into combat is 
hunger. Unfortunately, hatori have voracious appetites and food 
is rare in their home environment, so they never pass up an op¬ 
portunity to make a meal out of a passing traveler—or even an 
entire caravan. The baton's favorite hunting method is to posi¬ 
tion themselves along a well-used migratory trail or caravan 
route. When, believing the hatori to be no more than a rocky 
outcropping, a prospective meal passes nearby, the hatori spring 
into action. 

Once the battle begins, hatori try to bite their victims with 
their toothy maws. Greater hatori swallow' man-sized victims 
whole on a natural attack roll of 20. Such victims suffer ld!2 
points of damage per round from the crushing and acid effects of 
the digestive tract. Swallowed victims cannot escape until the ba¬ 
ton is killed, for the muscular action of the esophagus prevents 
them from climbing out the throat. 

Hatori use their bony tails to lash out at anyone attacking from 
the rear, or to attack fleeing victims while simultaneously trying 
to eat someone else 

Lesser hatori can swallow whole only opponents of Lender size 



or less (on a natural attack roll of 20). Experience points earned 
for defeating a hatori depend upon its number of HD. See Tables 
31 and 32 on page 47 of the 2nd Edition Dungeon Masters Guide 
to compute the XP values. 

Habitat/Society: Hatori live in the sandy regions of large des¬ 
erts. Because they are constantly searching for food, however, 
they tend to be found near migratory paths or along busy cara¬ 
van routes. They stay in a productive area until food becomes 
scarce. 

Hatori grow very slowly, at the rate of only 1-foot per year, 
but they keep growing throughout their lives. They accumulate 
Hit Dice at the rate of 1 HD every 10 years. Therefore, young 
hatori of 1 HD are usually 10 feet or less in length and 10 years 
old or younger, hatori of 2 HD are between 10 and 20 feet and 
between 10 and 20 years of age, etc. 

Females care for their hatchlings until the young reach 50 feet 
in length (5 HD), This is the only time when they are commonly 
encountered in groups, for adult hatori are solitary creatures. Fe¬ 
male hatori accompanied by hatchlings seldom exceed 10 HD, 
for they generally stop bearing young after their 100th yean 

Every 10 years, male hatori and young females without any 
offspring migrate to the center of the desert. Here the males en¬ 
gage in ferocious battles to win the right to breed with the fe¬ 
males. Although no civilized man has ever witnessed these 
mating rituals, certain desert tribes speak of a "time of thunder 
when mountains die," These legends may refer to battles occur¬ 
ring during the hatori mating season. 

Ecology Hatori eat anything, though they cannot digest gems or 
magical armor and weaponry; These items tend to accumulate in 
their stomachs over their long lifetimes. Hatori have no natural 
predators (save for each other at mating time), though it is rumored 
that certain kinds of dragons have been known to attack smaller ba¬ 
ton in times of hunger. Legends speak of a hidden hatori burial 
ground where ancient hatori go to die. If such a burial ground exists, 
it certainly abounds with gems and magical armor.

(Note: Statistics separated by a slash: those to the left refer to the 
natural state, those to the right are for a possessed victimJ 

A haunt is the restless spirit of a person who died leaving some 
vital task unfinished. Its sole purpose is to take over a living body 
and use it to complete the task, thus gaining a final release from 
this world. 

Haunts may assume either of two forms, at will: a hovering 
luminescent ball of light (identical in appearance to a wilTo-wisp) 
or a nebulous, translucent image of the haunt's former body. In 
the later state, haunts look like groaning spirits, spectres, or 
ghosts, and are often mistaken for them. Transformation from 
one state to the other takes one round. 

Combat: A haunt must remain within 60 yards of where it died, 
unless it lakes control of a victim's body, This 60-yard radius is 
called the haunt’s domain. 

A haunt attacks mindlessly, and always targets the first human 
or demihuman that enters its domain. It will continue to attack 
until possession is achieved or the intended victim leaves the 
haunt s domain. 

The touch of a haunt drains 2 points of Dexterity per hit. As 
the character s Dexterity is drained, he suffers not only the penal¬ 
ties of lowered Dexterity but increasing numbness creeps over 
his body. If Dexterity reaches G r the haunt slips Into the body and 
possesses it. Once the body is possessed, Dexterity returns to 
normal 

The haunt uses the host's body to complete its unfulfilled task. 
The task need not be dangerous, although it often Is. Once the 
task is completed, the haunt passes on to its final rest and the 
victim regains control of his body. When the haunt leaves a vic¬ 
tim, the character has a Dexterity of 3. Lost Dexterity points are 
regained at the rate of 1 point for each turn of complete rest. If a 
haunt's possessed body is slain, it will haunt the place where that 
body was killed. 

If the victim has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt 
(good vs. evil), the haunt will try to strangle the victim using the 
victim s own hands. Unless the victim s arms are being restrained, 
the strangulation begins the round after the haunt takes control 
of the body. On the first round the victim suffers 1 point of dam¬ 



age,, on the second 2, on the third 4, and so on, doubling each 
round until the victim is dead or the haunt is driven off. 

Attacks on a possessed character will cause full damage to the 
character's body, If attacked, the haunt will use whatever weap¬ 
ons and armor the victim carries, but it cannot use any items that 
would require special knowledge (spells, scrolls, rings t The only 
safe way to tree the victim is by casting fro/d person or dispel evil 
(good). If ho/d person is cast, the haunt must make a successful 
saving throw vs, paralyzation or be ejected from the body: dispel 
evil {good) destroys the haunt forever. 

Haunts are linked to the sites where they died and therefore 
cannot be turned by priests. When in the natural state (i.e., not 
possessing a body) haunts may be struck only by silver or magi¬ 
cal weapons, or by fire. Weapons cause only 1 point of damage, 
plus the magical bonus (if any). Normal fire causes 1 point of 
damage per round, but magical fire inflicts full damage. If a 
haunt is reduced to 0 hit points, it loses control of its form and 
fades away. The haunt reforms in one W'eek to haunt the same 
location again until its task is completed. 

HabitatSodety; The exact task to be accomplished varies, but 
the motives are always powerful—revenge, greed, love, hate 
Often great distances need to be traveled before a task can be 
completed, and haunts will drive their hosts mercilessly toward 
the goal, ignoring the need for food or sleep. 

A few haunts (10%) retain some knowledge of their former 
lives and can be communicated with. Often these haunts feel re¬ 
morse at having to prey upon the living, but the force of the un¬ 
completed task is too powerful for the haunt to resist. 

Ecology: Haunts cling to this world by force of will alone. They 
have no treasure of their own unless it is connected to their quest 
They prey only on humans and demihumans.

Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from another plane of ex¬ 
istence brought here in the service of evil beings, 

A hell hound resembles a large hound with rust-red or red- 
brown fur and red glowing eyes. The markings, teeth, and 
tongue arc soot black- Lt stands two to three feet high at the 
shoulder, and has a distinct odor of smoke and sulfur. The baying 
sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that send a shiver 
through any who hear them. 

Combat Hell hounds are clever hunters that operate in packs. 
They do not bay like normal dogs while hunting. They move 
with great stealth, imposing a -5 penalty to opponents 1 surprise 
rolls. One or two of the pack sneak up on a quarry while the 
others form a ring around it. The first hell hound then springs 
from ambush, attacks the nearest victim, and attempts to drive 
the others toward the rest of the pack, If the prey does not run 
away the rest of the pack closes in within Td4 +2 rounds. If hell 
hounds are pursuing fleeing prey they might bay 

Hell hounds attack first by breathing fire at an opponent up to 
10 yards away. The fire causes 1 point of damage for each of the 
hell hounds Hit Dice, A successful saving throw' vs, breath weap¬ 
on cuts the damage in half. The hell hound then attacks with its 
teeth. The hell hound can continue to exhale flame while biting. 
If the hell hound rolls a natural 20 on its attack roll, it grabs a 
victim in its jaws and breathes fire on the victim. 

Hell hounds have a variety of defenses. They are Immune to 
fire. Their keen hearing means they are surprised only on a I or 2 
on IdlO. They can also see hidden or invisible creatures 50% of 
the time. 

Habitat Society; Hell hounds are native to those extradimen- 
sional planes notable for their hot, fiery landscapes. There they 
roam in packs of 2d20 beasts. The hell hounds on the Prime Ma¬ 
terial plane are summoned there to serve the needs of evil crea¬ 
tures. Most of them later escape to the wild. 

Hell hounds may have 4 to 7 (1 d4 4^3) Hit Dice, The more Hit 
Dice a hdl hound has, the larger it is and the more damage it 
causes. Each pack is led by a 7-Hit Die hell hound. The leader 



drives off other 7 HD rivals, w T ho form their own packs. 

The diet of hell hounds is similar to that of normal canines. 
They roam a wide area of ldlD + 4 square miles centered on their 
den. Pack territories may overlap. 

They do not easily reproduce on the Prime Material plane. On¬ 
ly 5% of encounters include puppies. Such puppies are bom in 
litters of 2d4. They burp flame uncontrollably at feast once a day. 
The flames are harmless aside from the tendency to set fire to 
anything flammable in the area. Newborn puppies are at 10% of 
the adult growth; they quickly grow an additional 5% each 
month and reach full adult growth (4 HD) in Vfi years. While 
growing they can attack with their incendiary bite. Hell hound 
puppies up to two months old inflict 1 point of damage. Older 
ones add an additional 1 point for each additional six months of 
growth. 

Prey is usually eaten where it is slain, though hell hounds occa¬ 
sionally haul a carcass back to their den for later meals. Hell 
hounds are also similar to normal canines in that they may act as 
retrieves Some objects are specifically sought; this is especially 
the case in trained hell hounds. Other hell hounds are simply 
playful and use the retrieved items as toys. They especially like 
noisy bags and pouches filled with their late victims' treasures. 
Flammable containers eventually burn and spill their contents in 
or around the den. Parchments are rarely found here unless pro¬ 
tected by nonflammable containers. 

Ecology; Hell hounds have little place in the ecology of the nor¬ 
mal world. They are dangerous annoyances prone to cause fires 
wherever they hunt. Hell hounds cause more forest fires than any 
other creature except for humanoids. Hell hounds have their us¬ 
es, though. Because of their ability to easily detect hidden or in¬ 
visible creatures, hell hounds make excellent watch dogs, 
especially for intelligent monsters such as fire giants. 

Hell hounds can be domesticated if raised from puppies, but 
there is a 10% chance each year that domesticated hell hounds go 
wild.

The heucuva is an undead spirit similar in appearance to a skele¬ 
ton, but more dangerous and more difficult to dispel. 

The heucuva appears to be a humanoid skeleton of normal 
size. The bones are covered by a robe that is little more than tat¬ 
tered rags. 

Combat: The heucuva attacks by swiping with one of its hands; 
the sharp Huger bones are capable ot tearing into wood. A victim 
must roll a successful saving throw vs, poison or be afflicted with 
a disease. The victim suffers a daily loss of 1 point each of 
Strength and Constitution. A cure disease spell must be cast on 
the victim to prevent death and restore the lost points. 

Heucuva are treated as wights on the Turning Undead table. 
They are resistant to all mind-influencing spells. Heucuva bones 
soon crumble once the monsters are destroyed. 

Heucuva have a special hatred of priests. Once a priest uses his 
spells or tries to turn the heucuva, they will concentrate on at¬ 
tacking that priest. They may even ignore everyone else except 
for the priest and those defending him. 

Heucuva are able to polymorph themselves up to three times a 
day. They may use this power to assume a nonthreatening shape 
in order to get dose to an unsuspecring victim or avoid an unde¬ 
sired encounter when pursuing a specific prey Heucuva may as¬ 
sume the form of people they have met in the recent past, such as 
a past victim or a member of the party that encounters the mon¬ 
sters, If the heucuva are In their lairs, they may assume their old 
(livingl appearances- Groups encountered on the surface may ap¬ 
pear to be pilgrims in procession&lt; Such disguises fool only those 
who view the world solely via visible light; heucuva appear the 
same as other skeletal undead if looked at with infravision. The 
heucuva are incapable of speech; they can only moan or wail. 

Habitat Society Heucuva roam the dark places of the world. 
They can be found in subterranean realms, as well as most tem¬ 
perate or tropical regions. Cold seems to prevent heucuvan activ¬ 
ity for they are not found in high, desolate mountains or in any 
cold regions. 



Legends tell that heucuva are the restless Spirits of monastic 
priests who were less than faithful to their holy vows. In punish¬ 
ment for their heresies, they are forced to roam the dark, Their 
spirits, appearance* and holy powers have become perverted 
mockeries of their old selves. The tatters they wear are the unrec¬ 
ognizable remains of their monks robes. Instead of healing, they 
can kill with a diseased touch. Instead of helping others, they 
seek to kill all who still Jive. Even their old power to turn undead 
is now used to help them resist the efforts of others to turn them, 

Heucuva retain dim memories of their old lives. Their lairs are 
decorated as grotesque mockeries of their old abbeys and tem¬ 
ples, Tire corpses of past victims may be used to represent parish¬ 
ioners. These corpses may retain their original possessions, 
which may represent a large portion of the heucuvan treasure 
trove. Other accumulated treasures may be scattered around the 
mock altar as decorations or offerings. Such a mock temple is a 
chilling sight to most and an abomination that few good-aligned 
cleric can resist destroying. 

Some heucuva are nomadic and constantly wander on a pil¬ 
grimage to nowhere. Even these are mockeries of real pilgrim¬ 
ages. 

Ecology: Heucuva are malignant spirits that seek to destroy 
those who still live. They are used as examples to remind priests 
the fate that befalls those who stray from their devotion or use 
their religion as a mask to hide unpious deeds. Powdered 
heucuva bones may be used in the preparation of magical items 
intended to corrupt the spirits of living beings or to control un¬ 
dead.

The hippocampus is the most prized of the marine steeds, a crea¬ 
ture that combines features of a horse and a fish. 

The hippocampus has the head, forelegs, and torso of a horse. 
The equine section is covered with short hair. The mane is made 
of long, flexible fins. The front hooves are replaced by webbed 
tins that fold up as the leg moves forward, then fan out as the leg 
strokes back. Past the rib cage the body becomes fish-like. The 
tail tapers 14 feet into a wide horizontal fin. A dorsal fin is lo¬ 
cated on the rump. Coloration is that of seawater. Typical colors 
include ivory pale green, pale blue, aqua, deep blue, and deep 
green. 

Combat: Hippocampi are usually peaceful creatures. They do 
not attack unless cornered or if another hippocampus or an ally 
is threatened. They are fast enough to out-swim most anything 
that would want to attack them. 

The hippocampus attacks with a strong bite. It suddenly ex¬ 
tends its head, chomps down with a crushing bite, and then re¬ 
leases. Hippocampi do not hold onto their opponents. 

Hippocampi also butt their heads against targets. Such attacks 
may stun an opponent or break his bones. 

Their firm, powerfully muscled bodies provide a strong pro¬ 
tection against attack. The blood coagulates quickly on exposure 
to water, thus minimizing blood loss that could both debilitate 
the hippocampus and attract sharks (sharks have only a 20% 
chance of going into a feeding frenzy if the only bleeding creature 
is a hippocampus). 

HabitatSociety: Hippocampi are the prized steeds of the sea. 
They can be found in deep waters anywhere, in freshwater lakes 
and oceans. They are able to breathe fresh and salt water w-ith 
equal ease. They can also breathe air but require frequent gulps 
of water to keep from drying out. They are unable to move out of 
water. 

Despite their radically different environments* horses and hip¬ 
pocampi are very simitar. They have approximately the same 
sizes, life spans* and personalities, although hippocampi are 
blessed w T ith much higher intelligence. 

Hippocampi are herbivores. They normally graze on seaweed 
and other soft vegetation. If their usual fodder is unavailable, 
their strong teeth can chew up mollusks and coral. 

Wild hippocampi roam in herds of 2d4. These are usually a 
stallion, Ld4 mares, and the rest young hippocampi of either sex. 



Hippocampus mares lay a single, large egg. After six months, the 
egg hatches a single foal. Twins are extremely rare (1% chance)* 
The foals grow quickly in two years. The yearlings a re physically 
the equals of the adults. Hippocampian tales speak of a "Great 
Herd' 1 of hundreds or thousands of hippocampi that roams the 
uncharted reaches of the tar seas. No non-hippocampi have ever 
seen this spectacle. 

Hippocampi may be "domesticated" by water-breathing hu¬ 
manoids, especially tritons. In truth, the intelligent hippocampi 
cooperate with the humanoids. The hippocampi provide their 
services as steeds and allies while the humanoids provide protec¬ 
tion. The benevolent hippocampi may assist surface dwellers 
who are visiting the aquatic world, whether voluntarily or by 
accident- Many a shipwrecked sailor has been saved from 
drowning by a passing hippocampus. Hippocampi are good 
judges of character: they will not assist an evil being or anyone 
who acts in a hostile manner toward them. Sometimes a hippo- 
campuss offer of a ride can be more trouble than it is worth. 
Young hippocampi often forget that most surface dwellers 
breathe air, not water. 

Hippocampi do not accumulate treasure. Most spurn even or¬ 
namental gifts such as collars or leg bands. They simply have no 
use for these gewgaws. They do appreciate delicacies, however, 
in the forms of tasty foods not available in the water. 

Ecology: Hippocampi are one of the most successful of the in¬ 
telligent, good-aligned marine monsters. They maintain ties with 
mermen and sea elves, as well as surface dwellers who make their 
living in the water, They provide valuable services as steeds* 
guides, and allies. Hippocampus eggs sell for 1*500 gp. Young 
hippocampi are worth 2.500 gp. However, surface dwellers who 
have been saved by hippocampi remain so grateful to their form¬ 
er rescuers that they may attack any merchant selling eggs or 
foals in a public market and attempt to return the hippocampi to 
the sea,

Hippogriffs are flying monsters that have an equal likelihood to 
be predator, prey, or steed. 

The hippogriff is a monstrous hybrid of eagle and equine fea¬ 
tures. It has the ears, neck, mane, torso, and hind legs of a horse. 
The wings, forelegs, and face are those of an eagle. It is about the 
size of a light riding horse. A hippogriff may be colored russet 
golden tan, or a variety of browns. The feathers are usually a 
different shade than the hide. The beak is ivory or golden yellow. 

Combat: The hippogriff attacks with its eagle-like claws and 
beak. Each claw can tear for ld6 points of damage, while the 
scissor-like beak inflicts IdlO points of damage. 

Habitat/Society: Hippogriffs prefer the desolate sections of the 
temperate and tropic regions, especially rolling hills that enable 
them to get quickly airborne. 

Hippogriffs are territorial. They have a preferred grazing and 
hunting area that covers ld4 x 10 square miles. Somewhere in 
this territory is a naturally protected site that serves as the hippo- 
griff nest. Here is where the young hippogriffs stay. The nest is 
always guarded. 

The typical hippogriff herd includes 1-3 adult males, an equal 
number of mares, and the rest are immature young. There is a 
25% chance that one or more of the mares is pregnant. Gestation 
takes 10 months. During the first five months, this occurs within 
the mare. Then she lays an egg that hatches in another five 
months. Twin births are rare (1% chance)* 

The foal is able to walk upon hatching. Its beak remains soft 
for the first two weeks; this enables the foal to nurse. Then its 
beak hardens and the hippogriff switches to regurgitated food 
from its mother, The colts learn to eat solid meat at four months, 
although they are clumsy killers (-4 penalty to attack rolls and 
damage). At six months they can fly f] 8, class D) and fight with a 
-2 penalty to attack rolls and damage. Yearlings are identical to 
adults, although they are unable to breed until they are three 
years old. 

Wild hippogriffs are omnivorous. They feed on whatever is 
available, whether greenery, fruits, or wildlife. Hippogriffs are 
able to attack fairly large prey, such as bison, but they do not 



prey on carnivores. The exception is humanoids. Hippogriffs 
may in the absence of other meat, attack small groups of people. 
Bodies are then carried back to the nest to feed the others; this is 
where the victim's possessions usually spill out. Hippogriffs are 
clean monsters; they dispose of carcasses and other debris by car¬ 
rying them downhill . They like dear, sparkly things like glass, 
crystals, and precious gems. Males may amass a small trove kept 
covered by brush. As a mating ritual, he arranges these in a dis¬ 
play to entice mares. 

Ecology; Hippogriffs are closely related to griffons, lust as grif¬ 
fons are the result of crossing an eagle with a lion, hippogriffs 
resulted from the crossing of an eagle with a horse* Hippogriffs 
may have been created as a natural prey for the griffons, Fortu¬ 
nately for the hippogriff, its own formidable weapons give it a 
fighting chance. To make up for the griffon’s superiority, hippo¬ 
griffs gather in larger groups. 

Hippogriffs are also related to pegasi. Because the hippogriffs 
eat meal, pegasi avoid their company. 

Hippogriffs make excellent flying mounts. The maneuverabil¬ 
ity decreases to Class D, but their speed is unimpaired. They are 
less likely to eat the rider than a griffon is. 

If a hippogriff is captured while still very young (under four 
months), it can be domesticated and trained to serve as a steed. 
Hippogriff eggs sell for 1,000 gp, young hippogriffs for 2,000- 
3,000 gp, It will probably have to be taught to fly. Domestic hip¬ 
pogriffs are also taught to recognize a limited number of species 
as food; humanoids of course are not on that list. Hippogriffs 
have difficulty breeding in captivity. Like flying, the wild hippo¬ 
griff has to be captured before such skills are learned. Mature 
hippogriffs may be persuaded to voluntarily assist riders who can 
provide them with ample food or protection.

Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war 
with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, 
and aggressive. 

The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6 J /z* tall. 
Their hairy hide*; range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray 
Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have 
blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark 
brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be 
brightly colored, often bold, blood red* Any leather is always 
tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired. 

Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with 
ores, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can 
speak the common tongue of man. 

Combat: Hobgoblins in a typical force will be equipped with po- 
learms (30%), momingstars (20%). swords and bows (20%), 
spears (10%), swords and spears (10%), swords and morning 
stars (5%), or swords and v/hips (5%), 

Hobgoblins fight equally well in bright light or virtual dark¬ 
ness, having infra vision with a range of 60 feet, 

Hobgoblins hate elves and always attack them first. 

Habitat Society: Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the 
humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal 
bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meet¬ 
ings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse 185%) or open 
fighting (15%), Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate 
or subterranean realm. 

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have between 20 and 200 
(2dl0 x 10) adult male warriors. In addition, for every 20 male 
hobgoblins there will be a leader (known as a sergeant) and two 
assistants. These have 9 hit points each but still fight as 1 + l Hit 
Die monsters. Groups numbering over 100 are led by a sub-chief 
who has lo hit points and an Armor Class of 3. The great 
strength of a sub-chief gives it a ^2 on its damage rolls and al¬ 
lows it to fight as a 3 Hit Die monster. If the hobgoblins are en¬ 
countered in their lair, they will be led by a chief with AC 2. 22 
hit points, and + 3 points of damage per attack, who fights as a 4 
Hit Die monster, The chief has 5-20 (5d4) sub-chiefs acting as 
bodyguards. Leaders and chiefs always carry two weapons. 

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried in¬ 



to combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the 
battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be 
held by one of his sub-chiefs. 

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there 
will be half again that many females and three times as many 
children as adult males. 

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean com¬ 
plexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are forti¬ 
fied with a ditch, fence, 2 gates, and 3-6 guard towers. Villages 
are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incor¬ 
porate defensive features already present in the ruins. 

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy cat¬ 
apults, 2 light catapults, and a ballista for each 50 warriors. Un¬ 
derground complexes may be guarded by 2-12 carnivorous apes 
(60%), 

They are highly adept at mining and can detect new construc¬ 
tion, sloping passages, and shifting walls 40% of the time. 

Ecology: Hobgoblins fed superior to goblins or ores and may act 
as leaders for them. In such cases, the 'lesser races" are used as 
battle fodder Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or 
rich evil humanoids. 

Koalinth 

This marine species of hobgoblin is similar to the land dwelling 
variety in many respects, Koalinth dwell in shallow fresh or salt 
water and make their homes in caves. 

Their bodies have adapted to marine environments via the 
evolution of gills. Their webbed fingers and toes give them a 
movement rate of 12 when swimming. Their bodies are sleeker 
than those of hobgoblins and they have light green skin. They 
speak an unusual dialect of the hobgoblin tongue. 

They tend to employ thrusting weapons like spears and pole 
arms, Koalinth are every bit as disagreeable as hobgoblins, prey- 
ing on every thing they come across, especially aquatic human¬ 
oid and demi-human races. They detest aquatic elves.

Homonculi are small mystical beings created by magicians for 
spying and other special tasks. 

The average homonculous is vaguely humanoid in form. It is 
18 inches tall and its greenish, reptilian skin may have spots or 
warts. They have leathery, bat-like wings with a span of 24 inch¬ 
es and a mouth filled with long, pointed teeth that can inject a 
potent sleeping venom. 

Combat: The homonculous is a quick and agile Oyer which uses 
this ability to great advantage in combat. It can dart to and fro so 
quickly that any attempt to capture it short of a net or web spell 
is almost impossible. 

In combat, the homonculous will land on its chosen victim and 
bite with its needle-like fangs. In addition to doing 1-3 points of 
damage, the creature injects a powerful venom. Anyone bitten 
by the horn on ado us must save vs. poison or fall into a comatose 
sleep for 5-30 {5d6* minutes. 

The creature s saving throws are the same as those of its crea¬ 
tor. While most attacks against either the homonculous or crea¬ 
tor do not affect the other, there is one exception. Any attack 
which destroys the homonculous causes its creator to suffer 2-20 
(2dl0) points of damage. Conversely if the creator is slain, the 
homonculous also dies and its body swiftly melts away into a 
pool of ichor. 



contact with its master, though it can be removed from that re¬ 
gion by fora. As soon as it loses contact with its master, the crea¬ 
ture panics and will do anything to regain contact. Contact 
between the two cannot be maintained across planar or dimen¬ 
sional barriers. tf either the creator or homonculous is on another 
plane, the homonculous will remain near the point where it was 
last in contact with its master. 

Homonculi are a reflection of their creator. They have the cre¬ 
ators alignmentj basic intelligence, and even physical manner¬ 
isms. They are mute but can write if the creator is literate. They 
may assist their creator in a variety of tasks including magical 
endeavors, although they cannot themselves cast spells. 

Homonculi lairs are in the homes of their creators. Indulgent 
wizards may provide a specially built bed, nest, or living cham¬ 
ber. Otherwise, the homonculous simply perches wherever it 
can. 


Habitat/Sodety; Homonculi are artificial creatures created by 
wizards as living tools. The process by which one is created is 
long, complicated, and expensive. Any wizard who desires a ho- 
monculous servant must first locate and hire an alchemist. The 
wizard must provide one pint of his own blood and 500-2,000 
{ Ld4 x 500) gold pieces. The blood becomes the basis for the crea¬ 
ture's body while the money pays for a variety of other supplies 
and the alchemist s time. The alchemist requires 1-4 weeks to 
transform the blood into the necessary magical base. The wizard 
is then sent for and required to cast mending, mirror image, and 
wizard eye spells upon the fluids. As the last of these spells is 
worked, the fluids spontaneously coagulate and form the body of 
the homonculous. 

The homonculous is tdepathically linked to its creator. It 
knows everything that its master knows and transmits every¬ 
thing it sees and hears to him. The creator can telepathically con¬ 
trol the actions of the homonculous at a range of up to 480 yards. 
The homonculous will never willingly travel beyond the limits of 


Ecology: Homonculi are nothing more than tools. They have 
no place in the natural world and are not part of any ecological 
system. They provide the wizard who created them with a varie¬ 
ty of useful services, Commonly, a homonculous is called upon 
to act as a spy, scout, messenger, or emissary. Because of the po¬ 
tential harm which the death of a homonculous inflicts on its 
master they are seldom employed as body guards or living 
weapons. 

Although they are magical creations, homonculi possess the 
same biological functions as non-magical creatures. They must 
rest and require food and drink in order to survive. When eating, 
they share the tastes of their masters and generally consume 
about as much as a typical cat. 

There are rumors of magical means by which non-wizards can 
acquire their own form of homonculous. Although these are not 
widely believed to be valid, there are those who report having 
seen the process or its results first hand. If such a procedure ex¬ 
ists, it would be quite valuable to its discoverer.

The hook horror is a bipedal underground-dwelling monster 
that looks like a cross between a vulture and a man with hooks 
instead of hands. 

The hook horror stands about nine feet tall and weighs almost 
350 pounds. It has a tough, mottled grey exoskeleton, like that of 
an insect. Its front limbs end in 124nch-iong hooks. Its legs end in 
feet that have three small hooks, like long, sharp toes. Its head is 
shaped like that of a vulture, including the hooked beak. Its eyes 
are multifaceted. It is thought that the hook horror is distantly 
related to the cockroach or cave cricket. 

Hook horrors do not have a smell to humans and demi- 
humans, but an animal would detect a dry musty odor. They 
communicate in a series of clicks and clacks made by the exoskel¬ 
eton at their throats* In a cave, this eerie sound can echo a long 
way. They can use this to estimate cavern sizes and distances, 
much like the sonic radar of a bat. 


Combat: Hook horrors have acute hearing and are surprised 
only on a roll of 1, They always know their territory, and they 
try to ambush unsuspecting travelers or denizens. Each round 
they swing with both hooks. If in any round both hit, during that 
round their beaks hit automatically. They automatically inflict 
2d6 points of damage each round with the beak until at least one 
of the hooks is dislodged. 

The eyesight of the hook horrors is very poor. They are blind¬ 
ed in normal light. They use their extremely acute hearing to 
track and locate prey. Since their eyesight is so poor anyway, 
they suffer no combat or movement penalties if blinded or in 
complete darkness. They attack silenced opponents with the pen¬ 
alties others suffer when attacking blind. 

Hook horrors are natural climbers, as their hooks give them 
excellent purchase on rock surfaces. They can move at normal 
speed up vertical surfaces that are not sheer. Their great weight 
means that they cannot hang from the ceiling like other insects. 

Habitat Society: The obvious penalty for having hooks instead 
of hands is that hook horrors cannot use weapons or tools* They 
can only pick up items in their beaks. This severely restricts their 
ability to amass large treasures* 


A dan of hook horrors most often lives in caves and under¬ 
ground warrens. The entrance is usually up a vertical or steeply 
sloped rock wall. Each family unit in the clan has its own small 
cavern off a central cave area. The dans eggs are kept in the 
safest, most defensible place. The clan is ruled by the eldest fe¬ 
male, who never participates in combat. The eldest male, fre¬ 
quently the mate of the dan ruler, takes charge of all hunting or 
other combat situations and is considered the war chieftain. 

Members of a clan rarely fight each other. They may quarrel or 
not cooperate, but they rarely come to blows. Clans sometimes 
fight each other, but only when there is a bone of contention, 
such as territorial disputes. It is rare for a dan of hook horrors to 
want to rule large areas or to conquer other clans. 

Hook horrors have poor relationships with other races. Al¬ 
though they do not foolishly attack strong parties, generally oth¬ 
er creatures are considered to be meat. They retreat when faced 
with a stronger group. Hook horrors do not recognize indebted¬ 
ness or gratitude. Their simple language does not even have a 
term for these concepts, just because a player character saves the 
life of a hook horror does not mean that it will feel grateful and 
return the favor. 


Ecology: Although hook horrors are basically omnivores, they 
prefer meat. They can eat just about any cave-dwelling fungus, 
plants, lichens, or animals. Hook horrors are well acclimated to 
cave life. They have few natural predators, although anything 
that managed to catch one would try to eat it* 

The hook horror's exoskeleton dries and becomes too brittle 
for use afEer a month or so.

Horses are large quadrupeds often used for transportation, or as 
pack and draft animals, by human and demihuman races. They 
are frequently bred for their speed and for their beauty, 

A horse can be solid white, gray chestnut, brown, black, or 
various reddish tones; Its hide can instead show a variation or 
combination of these colors. Some of the more interesting varia¬ 
tions include the piebald- which has a coat of large, irregular 
patches of black and white; the palomino, with its rich yellow- 
gold coat and white mane and tail; and Lhe dapple gray which is 
dark gray with flecks of lighter color on the chest, belly and 
hindquarters. 

In addition to the coat's color, the horse may have markings of 
various sorts. The long hairs of the mane and tail can be lighter, 
darker, or of the same color as the body of the horse. Possible 
markings include socks (meaning the leg from the hoof, halfway 
to the knee, or hock, is white); a white muzzle; a blaze (a wide 
band of white from the top of the horse's head to the tip of its 
nose): and a star fa white, diamond-shaped patch set on the 
horse's forehead, right between its eyes). 

Horses are measured in "hands." One hand equals 4 inches. 

Combat: War horses will fight independently of the rider on the 
second and succeeding rounds of a melee. Other breeds fight only 
if cornered. Most attack twice per round by kicking with their 
front hooves. 

Unless specially trained, horses can be panicked by loud nois¬ 
es, strange smells, fire, or sudden movements 90% of the time. 
Horses trained and accustomed to such things (usually war- 
horses) panic only 10% of the time, 

Habitat/Society: The horse's gestation period is about 11 months, 
Mares (female horses) usually give birth to a single foal (young 
horse). Twins do occur, but only about 10% of the time (or less). 
Even triplets are possible, but are extremely rare. The foal is 
weaned after six months. It is mature after two to three years, 
and is considered adult at age five. The usual life span of a horse 
is 30-35 years, though rare exceptions have lived to age 50, and 
hard-worked horses rarely live past age 12. 

Only 10% of ponies and wild horses can be trained to serve as 
warhorses. Of all the breeds and varieties listed here, only mules 
are agile enough for use in mountainous or subterranean envi¬ 
ronments. 


Ecology: Modem horses evolved in temperate plains and grass¬ 
lands. Domestic breeds can be found anywhere people live (even 
In the high mountains, if the local roads are good). 

Horses can carry great weights for long periods of time, but 
not without tiring. The table below shows the maximum weight a 
horse can carry; as illustrated, greater weights cause the horse to 
move at slower movement rates.

As noted in Chapter 14 of the Players Handbook , in a day of 
travel over good terrain, a creature can travel a number of miles 
equal to twice its normal movement rate. A horse's overland 
movemenL rate can be improved by pushing it to a canter or gal¬ 
lop. A canter can be safely maintained for two hours, or a gallop 
for one hour, but the horse must be walked for an hour before its 


194 






Horses 


speed can again be increased. For the effects of increasing a 
horses speed enough to affect its overland movement rate, see 
Chapter 14 of the DMG, 

A horse will not gallop when loaded with enough material to 
reduce its normal movement rate by half: nor will it canter or 
gallop it carrying a load which will reduce its normal movement 
rate to one-third normal (see Horse Table 1). 

Draft Horse 

Draft horses are large animals bred to haul very heavy loads, and 
are usually trained to be part of a dray team. Muscular but slow', 
these ponderous animals haul freight over long distances without 
complaint, and are frequently used by traders. 

War Horse 

Warhorses are bred and trained to the lance, the spear, and the 
sword. They have higher morale than other horses, and are not 
as skittish about sudden movements and loud noises. The choice 
of knights and cavalry, these are the pinnacle of military horses. 
There are three varieties; heavy, medium and light. 

Heavy warhorses are similar to draft animals. Large and mus¬ 
cular. they are relatively slow. Their size and powerful legs allow 
them to be armored in plate, and to carry a warrior in plate, as 
easily as a pony carries saddle bags. A good heavy war horse, 
fully trained, costs 400 or more gold pieces. 

Medium war horses are lighter and smaller than their heavy 
cousins They can be encumbered with leather or light plate ar¬ 
mor and carry a rider wearing leather or light plate. The advan¬ 
tage of the medium war horse is its increased speed. The price of 
a medium war horse is 200 gp or more. 

Light war horses are the fastest of the breed. They can carry 
warriors in leather armor, but are rarely armored themselves, 
They make excellent mounts ior raiding parties, light cavalry, 
and thieves. Light war horses cost 150 gp or more. 

Pony 

Small horses used primarily for transportation and occasionally 
farm work, ponies are a lively breed. They are more excitable 
than the larger horses, but frequently more gentle, as well They 
are sometimes trained and used a$ war horses by several of the 
smaller demihuman races. Prices vary depending on training and 
size, but most cost around 500 gp. 

Wild Horse 

Wild horses can be captured and trained to serve as mounts or 
work ponies. Training usually takes twice as long as training a 
domestic horse. Wild horses are hardy but jittery and difficult to 
catch in the wild. They are sometimes hunted for food by human 
and demihuman tribes. 

Riding Horse 

Riding horses are bred to the saddle. Perhaps the most common 
of all horses, they are ridden, worked, and raced by humans and 
demihumam alike. The price of a riding horse wiU vary, depend¬ 
ing on its bloodlines, training, and appearance. Fast and agile, 
this breed is a good choice for personal transportation and gen¬ 
eral use. 

Mule 

Sterile hybrids of horses and donkeys, mules are very sure-footed 
and exceptionally stubborn. They can be ridden by patient han¬ 
dlers who know how to control them, but are best used as pack 
animals in difficult or mountainous terrain. They are sometimes 
used by adventurers, for they are the only breed that can be tak¬ 
en into subterranean regions. The price of mules depends on how 
much grief they have given their current owners. 



Steppe Pony 

A steppe pony is not attractive, graceful or large, but its homely, 
ungainly appearance disguises an animal of great endurance, 
speed, and strength, A steppe pony looks like a cross between a 
horse and a pony, but is a breed unto itself. They are small, aver¬ 
aging 13 hands (4 f 4' f ) at the withers, and they have short necks, 
large heads, and heavily boned bodies. Their winter coal is shag¬ 
gy and gives them the appearance of being half-wild. They are 
most commonly colored copper or bronze, with a light yellow 
stripe running down their backs. 

These horses are tough, hard to kill, and aggressive in batUe, 
They have most of the same characteristics as a light war horse, 
with a few exceptions. It attacks three times per round, its third 
attack being a bite which causes 1-3 points of damage. The steppe 
pony's thick, shaggy coat and tough hide gives it an AC of 6. Its 
short legs are powerful and can carry horse and rider swiftly,, 
over long distances; its small back is also very strong and it can 
carry as much as a medium war horse 1220/330/440). The steppe 
pony is even-tempered and steady in battle; its morale is average 
16-10), and it panics very rarely (5% chance) due to such things 
as fire and loud noises. 

The steppe pony has remarkable endurance. It can survive by 
grazing alone and does not require feeding and handling by its 
rider, so separate supplies of grain are not needed. It can be rid¬ 
den for long distances without tiring or faltering. A +3 modifier 
is applied to the pony's saving throw's for lameness and exhaus¬ 
tion checks w hen travelling overland. 

In spite of all its qualities, the steppe pony is not sought after or 
considered valuable, ll is most commonly ridden by nomadic 
tribes. Outside the steppes, the animal is almost completely un¬ 
known and does not command high prices at auction. Only 
breeders who know the steppe pony's qualities, and who seek 
strength and stamina in their own horses bloodlines, are likely to 
consider the steppe pony as valuable.

Aborigine/Caveman 

These primitive humans are found m otherwise uninhabited regions. 
For every 10 aborigines there will he a 3rd-level fighter. Aboriginal 
tribes are always led by a chief (a 5th-level fighter) and 1-4 subehiefs 
(4th-level fighters). For every 10 aborigines encountered there is a 
10% chance that they have a shaman (3rd* level priest) with them. 

Most encounters (60%) will be with predominantly male war or 
hunting/gathering parties. There is a 40% chance that an encounter 
will be in or near their lair. Aborigines make their lairs in natural 
shelters such as caves or forest groves. The number encountered 
above is for males; there will usually be an equal number of females 
and children in the lair. 

Aborigines are typically armed with stone axes, spears, and dubs.

Adventurer 

These are NFC counterparts of the PCs band, groups of fighters, thieves, 
priests, and wizards who band together in search of fame, fortune, and 
power. Typical adventuring bands consist of between two to eight mem¬ 
bers. Solitary adventurers may be separated from their group, lost, 
advanced scouts, or sole survivors of decimated groups. 

After determining the base stee of the group encountered, deter¬ 
mine which class each belongs to;

Determine the lovd of the party of adventurers; low, medium, high, 
or very high, and roll for each member on the table below.

Low 1-3 (ld3) 

Medium 4-7 (ld4 + 3) 

High 7-12 (ld6 + 6) 

Very high 9*20 (ldl2+8) 


A high level adventurer will have attracted followers who will ac¬ 
company the party —1-100% of them* This can swell an encountered 
band's size to that of a small army. 

Clerics and wizards will have 1-100% of their full spells at the time 
the encounter occurs (round down). 

Higher level fighters and clerics will usually have plate mail and 
shields, and ride unbarded medium warhorses. Each level an adven¬ 
turer has attained gives a cumulative 5% chance for magical items as 
shown below. Roll tor each item marked "Yr Reroll tf a cursed or 
otherwise undesirable item occurs, but only one reroll is allowed for 
each category. If no usable item is indicated, the adventurer has no 
item in that category'.

In addition, such adventurers have ordinary treasure. Fighters 
have type L and M; clerics J, K, and M; wizards L, N. and Q; and 
thieves J P N. and Q. 

Bandit Brigand 

Bandits are rural thieves who openly prey on travelers and isolated 
dwellings. They travel in groups of 20-200, usually led by high level 
fighters, rogues, wizards, and priests. For every 20 bandits encoun¬ 
tered, there will be an additional 3rd-level fighter. If 100+ are en¬ 
countered, the leader will be at least 8th level. Bandits are typically 
armed with swords, spears, and small shields. Up to 20% may be 
armed with bows. Bandits may wear no armor (50%), leather (35%), 
padded (10%), or ring mail (5%). Brigands are better equipped and 
will have higher morale. 

Barbarian Nomad 

Barbarians belong to primitive cultures that possess rudimentary 
skills such as animal husbandry and simple manufacturing (weaving, 
carving). They may live in villages of simple buildings or in portable 
structures like tents, tepees, yurts, or wagons. In aquatic regions, 
they may live on watercraft like canoes or rafts. 

Barbarians are typically armed with swords, knives, bows, spears, 
and dubs, Armor is limited to shields, helmets, and chestplates. They 
tend to be hostile toward unfamiliar wizards. Barbarians are adept at 
surprising opponents; such opponents have a -5 penalty on their 
surprise rolls. 

Berserker/Dervish 

Berserkers are violent war parties prone to manic behavior in battle. 
When encountered, berserkers drive themselves into a battle frenzy 
that raises their fighting skills and morale, Berserkers attack twice per 
round, or once at+2. Many use leather armor and shields, giving 
them Armor Class 7, Berserkers need never make morale checks. 



Dervishes are highly religious nomads. Due to their fanatical na¬ 
ture, dervishes add 1 to their attack rolls and damage dice. They nev¬ 
er check morale in combat. 

If encountered during a peaceful period, berserkers may be indis¬ 
tinguishable from normal warrior bands; dervishes may be mistaken 
for armed pilgrims. 

Farmer Herder 

These are simple people involved in the production of agricultural 
goods. About 65% of all encounters will be with larmers tilling their 
land. Encounters with herders may occur anywhere there is grazing 
land or a market for their herds. Encounters with herders also in¬ 
volve the herd animals, whatever they are. 

Gentiy 

These are the upper classes. They are not the ruling nobility but their 
wealth and connections make them nearly as powerful. Each member 
of the gentry encountered may be accompanied by 0-3 guards (d4-l) 
and 1-6 servants. The guards are mercenary fighters of 1st to 6th level 
and armed with sword and spear. The servants might fight as 0-levd 
fighters, but are more likely to panic. The gentry themselves might be 
armed with daggers and short swords. 

Knight 

Knights are armored, mounted fighters directly serving their lord. 
They may be on a quest, a specific mission, or simply patrolling their 
lord's realm. Knights may be accompanied by their squires, hirelings, 
and other followers (50%). Knights are armed with sword, lance, 
mace or flad, and dagger. Armor includes a shield and either plate or 
chain mail. A knight rides a medium or heavy warhorse, usually a 
barded mount. 

About 5% of encounters will be with a vanquished knight. Being 
stripped of arms and armor, the knight may be mistaken for any non- 
warrior class. The knight may even support this deception, at least 
until weaponry becomes available. 

See Adventurer to determine level and special possessions.

Human 




Mercenary Soldier 

These are groups i&gt;t low level fighters who hire themselves to the 
highest bidder. When encountered, there is an even chance they may 
be already hired and on their way to a war, meeting with a prosper 
tive employer open for employment, or on their way home and not 
willing to take on a new task just yet. 

See Adventurer to determine level and special possessions. 

Merchant Sailor Fisherman 

Men of the sea are usually found on or near open waters. If encoun¬ 
tered inland, sailors may be ferrymen on streams or rivers. Fishermen 
will either be putting out to a fishing site, fishing, or returning with 
their catches. Sailors may be armed with knives, short swords, cut¬ 
lasses. or belaying pirn (I point of damage). 

Merchant/Trader 

Merchants and traders deal in goods and services. Those encountered 
in the wild are traveling in caravans in search of new business. Only 
10% of the number encountered are actually merchants. 10% are 
drovers and the rest are mercenary guards. The guards are led by a 
fighter (6th-i 1th level] and a lieutenant one level lower. Each leader Is 
accompanied by 12 guards of 2nd level . For each 50 people in the 
caravan there is a 10% chance of a wizard (6th-Sth level! and a 5% 
chance of a priest (5th-7lh level), as well as a 15% chance of a thief 
(fith-lflth leveli accompanied by 1-4 thieves (3rd-7th level). All such 
leaders, guards, and special characters are in addition to the number 
of merchants, drovers, and normal guards. 

The treasure is mostly in trade goods (90%). The caravan has 10 
pack animals or one wagon per 5,000 gp value. 

Middle Gass 

These are travelers journeying on personal business. They are found 
primarily in civilized regions, although pioneers may be encountered 
in relatively peaceful frontier regions. Middle class travelers may be 
armed with knives, daggers, and short swords. 

Peasant'Serf 

Peasants are farmers, herders, and simple tradesmen of low social 


class. Unlike serfs, peasants are freemen, 

Serfs are totally subject to the local lord: they are the lowest of the 
social classes. They farm and perform the brute labor functions on 
large agricultural holdings. Serfs, really, are little more than slaves. 

Both peasants and serfs may be armed with daggers, dubs, quar- 
terstaves, and farming took. They never have any treasure except 
under the rarest of occasions when they are able to hoard scavenged 
goods. 


Pilgrim 

Pilgrims are groups of the devout on their way to or from a holy 
place. They can be found anywhere 

A group of pilgrims will always be accompanied by priests and 
other character classes. These people may be acting as leaders, 
guards, or pilgrims. Groups of pilgrims always include one to six 
2nd-Ievel priests, one to four 4th4evel priests, one or two 6th4evel 
and one Sth-level priest (accompanied by one 3rd- and one Sth-kvel 
assistant). For every 10 pilgrims, there is a 10% chance of one to eight 
fighters (IsMfth level) and 1-6 thieves (2nd-7th level). There is a 5% 
chance per 10 pilgrims of a wizard of 6th-9th level. If the pilgrims are 
lawful good, the fighters will be paladins; if the pilgrims are chaotic 
good, the fighters wilt be rangers, 1( the party is neutral, the priests 
will be druids. If the pilgrims are lawful evil, they all fight as ber¬ 
serkers, although armed only with daggers. 

Pilgrim alignment is determined below';

carefully hidden and protected by traps and magic.

Human 


Pirate' Buccaneer 

These are seafaring thieves and fighters. Pirates are always led by a 
captain of 8th or 10th level—8th if fewer than 200, The captain will 
have a 6th- or 7th-levcl lieutenant and four mates of 4th level. For 
every 50 pirates encountered, there will be a 3rd-level fighter as well 
as a 15% chance for a cleric of 12th-I5ih level and a i0% chance for a 
wizard of 6th-9th level. For every 100 pirates, there will be a 5th-level 
fighter. All of these are in addition to the pirates already indicated by 
the dice. 

Pirates wear leather armor; leaders wear chain mail. All are armed 
with knives, swords, and polearms. Some will be armed with cross¬ 
bows, either light (20%) or heavy (10%). In addition their ships may 
be equipped with ballistae or catapults. 

Buccaneers are similar, but are neutral with evil tendencies. 

Police'Constabulary 

These are the duly appointed representatives of the local govern¬ 
ment, concerned with upholding the laws, maintaining the peace 
and carrying out their superior s will. If constables are encountered in 
the wilderness, they might be pursuing a fugitive (50%} or investigat¬ 
ing a case on the outskirts of their jurisdiction (50%). Constables are 
the equivalent of fighters of Ist-4th level. Wilderness encounters in¬ 
clude a 25% chance that the constables are accompanied by a mob. 
The mob is composed of citizenry temporarily deputized to assist the 
police; they fight as 0-level fighters. 

Priest 

These are typical NPC priests traveling on personal business or on a 
mission. The number encountered refers to the number of actual 
priests. It they are of high enough level they might also have fob 
lowers accompanying them (50%). 

See Adventurers” to determine level and special possessions* 

Sailor 

Nonmerchant sailors are the seagoing armed forces of the local gov¬ 
ernment. acting as police or soldiers. They may be patrolling their 
home waters, pursuing a waterborne criminal, or on their way to or 
from a mission in other waters. Each ship is commanded by a captain 
(6thdevel fighter) and a brst officer (5th-level fighter). Sailors are 
armed with swords knives, bows, and polearms. They may also be 
armed with heavier weapons such as catapults and ballistae. 

Slaver 

Slavers are usually found in control of a band of captive slaves; if no 
slaves are present, the slavers may be mistaken for mercenaries or 
brigands. The slavers leader might be a thief, fighter, or fighter/thief 
(6th-11th level), assisted by a lieutenant one level lower, Each leader 
is accompanied by 1-12 guards of 1st or 2nd level. For each 50 slaves 
and slavers, there is a 10% chance of a wizard (bthTJth level) and a 
5% chance of a priest (5th-7th level); these work for the slavers. 

There are ID slaves present for each 1-10 slavers. Slaves are treated 
the same as serfs. They may be recently acquired captives being tak¬ 
en from their homelands or long-time slaves being moved to a new 
market. Such slaves will be on fool and linked together in strings of 
10-100 by ropes or chains. They will be willing to help any adventur¬ 
ers who try to rescue them, although they will be limited in the help 
they can provide. Slaves may be any class or type, but only 1% of 
captives belong to one of the character classes. 

Soldier 

These are organized militia engaged in the defense of their home re¬ 
gion. Soldiers are led by a captain (6th level or higher) and a lieuten¬ 
ant (1-4 levels lower). Each leader is accompanied by 1-12 soldiers ol 
1st or 2nd level, Most soldiers are engaged in routine patrols of the 
homeland, U local wars are occurring, there is a 50% chance that the 
soldiers are either heading off to the war or returning from it. There is 
a 5% chance of a cleric (5th-7th level) for each 50 soldiers present. 
See Adventurers" to determine level and special possessions. 



Thief/Thug 

These are low level rogues who, if not already engaged in a crime, 
may attempt to rob wealthy or weak-looking adventurers, Thieves 
may be armed with concealed weapons such as knives, darts, black¬ 
jacks, and short swords. 

See "Adventurers'' to determine level and special possessions 
Tradesfo lk/Craftspe o pie 

People engaged in the trades and crafts will be about their business 
when encountered. They may be operating a shop, acquiring materi¬ 
als for their business, or traveling to or from a client's location. They 
are willing to do business with adventurers, provided they are prop¬ 
erly paid. They will not attack except to defend themselves. Note 
that 1 % of all tradesfolk may be retired adventurers. Tradesmen may 
be armed with knives, quarterstaves, and tools. 

About 90% of their treasure is merchandise or equipment. 

Tribal Culture 

Tribal societies are the heart of primitive cultures; people hunt, fish, 
and farm near their simple villages. They are found in any climate. 

For each 10 tribespeople, there will bean additional 3rd-Ievel fight¬ 
er, Tribes are led by a chief (a 5th-level fighter) and 1-4 subchiefs (4th- 
level fighters). For every 10 encountered, there is a 4thdevel priest 
with them, and for each 30 tribespeople encountered, a 6th-leve| 
priest. The tribe has a shaman (Sth-tevd. priest). Tribal priests tend to 
be druidical in nature. 

Tribal villages are made of local materials (grass, bamboo, mud. 
ice). In addition to the males encountered, there will also be an equal 
number of women and a 75% chance of 20-50 slaves. 

Tribesmens weapons are typically dubs, knives, spears, and 
bows. Armor is limited to shields. 

Wizard 

These are typical NPC wizards. They may be engaged in personal 
business, gathering materials, or traveling. The number encountered 
Fefers to the number of actual wizards. They may be accompanied by 
0-3 (ld4-l) servants and guards for each wizard. Guards are fighters 
1-4 levels lower than the wizard they protect.

Combat: Hydrae always have 8 points on each of their Hit Dice and 
all heads must be severed before the hydra dies. A hydra can bring up 
to four heads into action against a single foe* biting once with each of 
them. 

Each time a hydra takes 8 points of damage, one of its heads is 
assumed to have been severed. When this happens, a natural reflex 
seals the neck arteries shut to prevent blood loss. 

Hydrae attack according to the number of heads they have. There¬ 
fore, a 10-headed hydra continues to attack as a 10 HD monster even 
after several heads have been slain. 

Attacks on the body have no effect unless a single attack inflicts 
damage equal to the hydra's original hit points. 


Habitat Society: Hydrae are solitary creatures who prefer dismal sur¬ 
roundings. They gather only to mate. 


Ecology: Despite the hydras size and multiple attacks, they are often 
preyed upon by dragons. They are impossible to train. 


Lcmaean Hydra 

Although similar to a normal hydra Lemaean hydrae will regenerate 
two heads for each one that is severed. A maximum of 12 heads can be 
grown. New heads form in 1-4 rounds and can be avoided only by the 
prompt application of flame to the neck following the attack which de¬ 
stroyed the first head. This hydra's body is immune to all attacks. 


Pyrohydra 

These reddish hydra have 7 or 8 heads which are able to breathe a jet 
of fire (5' wide and T long) twice per day. This attack does 8 points of 
damage, halved if a save vs. breath weapon is made. 


Hydrae are immense reptilian monsters with multiple heads. For each 
Hit Die the hydra has, it will have one head. The chart above lists the 
THAC0 value for hydrae, the number of heads and the damage that 
they inflict each time they bite. 

Hydrae are gray-brown to dark brown, with light yellow or tan 
underbellies. Their eyes are amber and their teeth are yellow-white. 
Hydrae have between 5 and 12 heads &lt; ld8 +4). 


Cryahydra 

Each head of this purplish-brown hydra is able to breathe a stream of 
frost 10 feet wide and 20 feet long which does 8 points of damage. A 
save vs. breath weapon is allowed for half damage.

Imps arc diminutive creatures of an evil nature who roam the 
world and act as familiars for lawful evil wizards and priests, 

The average imp is a 2’ humanoid with leathery, bat-like 
wings, a barbed tail and sharp, twisted horns. Its skin is a dark 
red and its horns and jagged teeth are a gleaming white. 

The imp can polymath itseli into two other animal forms. 
The most commonly encountered alternate forms are those of a 
large spider, raven, giant rat, or goat. In such forms the imp is 
physically identical to a normal animal. 

Combat: In its natural form, the imp attacks with the wicked 
stinger on its tail. In addition to inflicting 1-4 points of damage, 
this stinger injects a powerful poison which is so deadly that 
those who fail their save versus poison are instantly slain by it. 
When it is poly morphed, the imp attacks with the natural weap¬ 
onry of its adopted form, though the goat and raven forms lack 
damaging attacks. 

The imp can use its special magical abilities no matter what its 
form. All imps are able to delect good, detect magic, or become 
motsibie at will. Once per day they can use a suggestion. 

Imps are immune to attacks based on cold, fire, or electricity 
and resist all other spell attacks as if they were 7 Hit Die crea¬ 
tures, They can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons 
and are able to regenerate one hit point per melee round. 

Habitat Society: imps are beings of a very evil nature who orig¬ 
inate on the darkest of evil planes. Their main purpose on the 
Prime Material plane is to spread evil by assisting lawful evil wiz¬ 
ards and priests. When such a person is judged worthy of an 
imp's service, the imp comes in answer to a find /umi/iar spell. 

Once they have contacted their new "master', imps begin at 
once to take control of his actions. Although imps maintain the 
illusion that the summoner is in charge, the actual relationship is 
closer to that of a workman (the imp) and his tools (the master). 

Although an imp s body can be destroyed on the Prime Materi¬ 
al plane, it is not so easily slain. When its physical form is lost, its 
corrupt spirit instantly returns to its home plane where it is re¬ 
formed and, after a time, returned to our world to resume its 
work. 

While they are technically in the service of their master, imps re¬ 
tain a basic independence and ambition to become more powerful 
someday. They may acquire treasure from those they slay, and will 
often pilfer valuables encountered during their travels. 



The imp confers some of its powers upon its master. A tele¬ 
pathic link connects the two whenever they are within one mile 
of each other. This enables the master to receive all of the imp s 
sensory impressions, including its infra vision. The master also 
gains the imps inherent 25% magical resistance and is able to 
regenerate just as the imp does, If the imp is within telepathic 
range, the master acts as if he were one level higher than he actu¬ 
ally is. Conversely, if the imp is more than a mile away, the mas¬ 
ter acts as if he were one level of ability below his actual rank. If 
the imp is killed, the master instantly drops by four levels, 
though these can be regained in the usual manner. 

Ecology: Imps are the errand boys of the powerful evil beings 
who command the darkest planes. They often act as emissaries 
and agents, but their primary task is to enhance the spread of evil 
in our world, 

Quasit 

Quasits are chaotic evil counterparts to imps. The chaotic evil 
priests and wizards which quasits '"serve 1 ' gain I he same benefits 
and disadvantages that an imps master does. Like imps, each 
quasit can assume two other forms. Those most commonly cho¬ 
sen by quasits are bats, giant centipedes, frogs, or wolves. They 
can use their magic in any of their forms. 

The quasit attacks with its clawed hands (doing 1-2 points 
each) and its deadly bite (doing 1-4 points). The quasits claws are 
coated in a toxin which causes anyone struck by them to save 
versus poison or lose one point of dexterity for 2-12 (2d6) 
rounds. The effects of multiple wounds are cumulative- 
Quasits can turn invisible, detect good, or defect magic at will. 
They regenerate 1 hit point per round and can unleash a blast of 
tear with a 30 foot range radius once per day. Once each week 
the quasit can commune with the lower planes (asking up to 6 
questions). 

Quasits can only be harmed by cold iron or magical weapons. 
They are able to resist magic 25% of the time, save as it they were 
7 Hit Die monsters and are immune to cold, tire, and lightning,

Mephits are nasty little messengers created by powerful lower 
planes creatures. They are evil and malicious bv nature and ap¬ 
pear on the Prime material plane only to perform evil deeds. Six 
types of mephits are known; fire, ice. lava, mist, smoke, and 
steam. Each is created from the substance for which it is named. 

Mephits appear as rhin, 5-foot humanoids with wings. Their 
faces have exaggerated features, including hooked noses, pointed 
ears, wide eyes, and protruding chins. Their skin continually 
oozes the stuff from which they were made. Mephits speak a 
common mephit tongue. 

Combat; In battle, mephits attack with either clawed hands or 
breath weapons. Damage is variable depending on the type of 
mephit encountered. All mephits have the ability to gtfte in other 
mephits; the type gated in and percentage chance for success var¬ 
ies with the mephit initiating the gating (see below for details). 

Habitat,Society;Mephits love tormenting helpless creatures and 
bragging about their latest evil accomplishments. They wear gar¬ 
ish, vulgar costumes in bizarre colors and outrageous designs. 
They give themselves pompous, impossibly long names, such as 
Garben aferlhal-sprite-slayer-greatest-of-all-the-st earn-mephits. 

Mephits assume a groveling, craven, yes-master stance around 
their bosses. Toward victims and each other, mephits drop their 
humble servant persona and take on the arrogant air of a superi¬ 
or being. A limited camaraderie exists between mephits of the 
same order Disputes between different types are often settled by 
a friendly game of tug-a-dermhuman. 

Mephits are usually assigned to deliver some message or pick 
to up packages on the lower planes, but occasionally (5 % 1 they 
are sent to the Prime material plane. Missions on the Prime mate¬ 
rial plane include retrieving a particular person, delivering a spe¬ 
cial magical item, or just spreading a little mayhem (so folks 
don t forget the lower planes are still there). 

Ecology: Mephits lead brief, troublesome lives. They are quickly 
created and destroyed, but they have no predetermined life span. 
They never eat, but must return to the substance from which 
they were formed to heal damage (usually 1 hit point per turn in 
contact). 

Fire Mephit 

The most mischievous of all mephits, these fiends play terrible 
pranks on other mephits (such as pushing lava mephits into wa¬ 
ter and watching them harden) and on their victims. 


Touching a fire mephit causes 1 point of heat damage (no sav¬ 
ing throw). Their clawed hands rake for Id3 points of damage 
each, plus 1 hit point of heat damage per hit. 

Fire mephits may use their breath weapon three times a day. It 
has two forms. The first is a flame jet 15 feet long and 1-foot 
wide. This jet automatically hits one target, of the mephits 
choosing, for IdS + l points of damage (half if saving throw is 
successful). The second f orm is a fan of flame covering a 120 arc 
directly in front of the mephit to a distance of 5 feet. Any crea¬ 
ture in the arc suffers 4 points of damage, no saving throw al¬ 
lowed. 

Fire mephits may also cast heat metal and magic missile (two 
missiles) spells each once per day. Once every hour a fire mephit 
can attempt to gate in another mephit. The chance for success is 
25% and the summoned mephit is either fire, lava, smoke, or 
steam (equal probability of each). 

Ice Mephit 

Ice mephits are angular in form, with translucent ice-blue skin. 
They live on the colder lower planes and never mix with fire, 
lava, smoke, or steam mephits. Ice mephits are aloof and cruel, 
surpassing all other mephits in the fine arts of torture and wanton 
destruction. 

In combat, ice mephits attack with two clawed hands, inflict¬ 
ing 1-2 points of damage each. In addition, their chilling touch 
has a freezing effect, reducing the victim's hit points by 1 per hit 
no saving throw allowed. These effects are cumulative and Iasi 
three to four turns, or until the victim is healed to full hit points 
(whichever comes first). 

Ice mephits may breathe a volley of ice shards three times per 
day. This volley automatically hits a single victim within 15 feet 
of the mephit. Damage is id6, halved if the victim rolls a success¬ 
ful saving throw. 

Once per hour an ice mephit may attempt to gate in one other 
mephit. The chance of success is 25% and the summoned mephit 
is either mist or ice (equal probability of each)* 

Lava Mephit 

Lava mephits are the least intelligent of all mephits. They are 
slow on the uptake and frequently the brunt of fire mephil jokes. 
Lava mephits generate extreme heat that can be felt 30 feet away 
Their daws are small and soft, causing only 1 point of damage 
when they hit, but each hit inflicts an additional ld8 points of 


202 






Imp, Mephit 


heat damage. The touch of a lava mephit automatically melts or 
burns most materials. The rate of this destruction varies from 
one hour to bum through an inch of wood to three rounds to 
completely melt plate armor. 

Their breath weapon is a molten blob of lava usable once eve¬ 
ry three melee rounds. This blob automatically hits one target 
within 10 feet ot the breathing mephit (Id6 points of damage, no 
saving throwh A lava mephit may use this weapon a maximum 
of eight times, after that, the mephit must recharge by soaking in 
a lava pool for on hour. Mephits may recharge during battle, if 
they come in contact with lava during combat, they regenerate 2 
hit points per melee round. This ability is, of course, lost if the 
mephit is brought to 0 hit points or less, at this point the mephit is 
dead. These fiends may shapechange into a pool of lava 3 feet in 
diameter by 6 inches deep. This maneuver does not recharge the 
breath weapon. They may still be harmed normally when in this 
lava pool form. 

Once every hour, a lava mephit may attempt to gate in 1-2 oth¬ 
er mephits. The chance of success is 25%, If two are summoned 
they are of the same type (equal probability of fire, lava, smoke, 
or steam). 

Mist Mephit 

Mist mephits fancy themselves as spies par excellence and prac- 
tice this ability on other mephits. They are quick to report other 
mephits who show mercy or any other treasonous behavior, and 
they never engage in idle banter with other mephits. Mist 
mephits have the ability to see clearly in fog or mist. Their skin is 
pale green. They never engage in melee unless they are trapped. 
Their soft daws inflict just I point of damage when they hit. Mist 
mephits may breathe a sickly, green ball of mist, every other 
round, up to three times an hour This ball automatically enve¬ 
lopes one victim within 10 feet of the breathing mephit. The vic¬ 
tim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer 
ld4 + 1 points of choking damage and be blinded for ldl rounds. 
In addition to the breath weapon, mist mephits can create a wall 
of fog (as the spell) once per day (at a 3rd level ability). They can 
also assume gaseous form once per day and often use this ability 
to spy on others or escape combat. 

Once per hour a mist mephit may attempt to gate in 1-2 other 
mephits. The chance of success is 20%, If two mephits arrive, 
they are of the same type (either ice or mist, equal probability). 

Smoke Mephit 

Smoke mephits are crude and lazy. They spend most of their time 
lounging around invisible, smoking pipe weed, telling bad jokes 
about their creators, and shirking their responsibilities, 

Smoke mephits' two clawed hands cause 1-2 points of damage 
each. Their breath weapon consists of a sooty ball usable every 
other melee round, with no limit on the number of times it can be 
used in a day. The sooty ball automatically strikes one creature of 
the mephit $ choice within 20 feet , causing Id4 points of damage 
and blinding the victim for 1-2 rounds. No saving throw is per¬ 
mitted. 

Smoke mephits may cast invisibility and dancing lights once 
each per day. Once per hour they can attempt to gate in 1-2 other 
mephits. The chance of success is 20%. with equal probability of 
the summoned mephits being fire, lava, smoke, or steam. If two 
mephits appear, they are of the same type. 

When a smoke mephit dies, it disappears in a flash of flame. 
The flash causes i point of damage to all creatures within 10 feet 
{no saving throw). 



Steam Mephit 

Steam mephits are the self-appointed overlords of all mephits. 
They frequently give orders to weaker mephits, in addition to 
hissing steam escaping from their pores, steam mephits leave a 
trail of near-boiling water wherever they walk. 

The hardened claws of a steam mephit cause ld4 points of 
damage each, plus 1 additional point of heat damage per touch 
(no saving throw). In addition, the victim is 50% likely to be 
stunned for one round. These effects are cumulative, so a victim 
raked twice could be stunned for two rounds. 

Steam mephits can breath a scalding jet of water every other 
round; no limit to the number of times per day this can be used. 
This jet has a 20-foot range and automatically hits its target. 
Damage is ld3 points (no saving throw) with a 50% chance of 
stunning the victim for one round. 

Once per day a steam mephit may create a rainstorm of boiling 
water over a 20-by 20-fool area, This storm inflicts 2d6 points of 
damage to all victims caught in the area of effect, with no saving 
throw allowed. Steam mephits may also contaminate water once 
per day (reverse of purify water). 

Once per hour a steam mephit may attempt to gate in i-2 other 
mephits with a 30% chance of success. There is an equal proba¬ 
bility that the summoned mephits are either fire, lava, smoke, or 
steam. II two are summoned: they are of the same type. 

Unlike other mephits, who will delay an attack for as long as 
possible, steam mephits are ruled by their oversized egos. They 
will even ambush even large, well-armed parties, striking first 
with boiling rainsLorms, then concentrating their breath weapons 
on the nearest wizard or priest.

Insects are the heartiest and the most numerous of creatures. Normal 
insects are found almost everywhere. The giant variety, marry of 
which are listed here, with added brawn and power, make tough op¬ 
ponents. 

Ant, Giant 

Both worker and warrior ants fight. If a warrior manages to bite, it 
also tries to sting for 3d4 points damage. A successful save reduces 
damage to ld4, The queen has 10 HD but does not move or fight. 

Ant Lion Giant 

The ant lion builds tapering pits in loose sand and waits for prey to 
fall in. Once the ant lion hits, all additional attacks are automatic, 

Aratha 

Aratha grasp and hold prey with their 0-foot clawed tentacles that 
can lash out 20 feet. An aratha does not bite opponents, but chews 
flesh tom from prey by its tentacles.

Aspis, Cow 

Aspis cows exude a dangerous corrosive that coats the body and ad¬ 
heres to the walls and floor of Lhe chambers. This corrosive causes 
damage every round her opponents stay tn her chamber, 

Aspis, Drone 

Most combat situations are handled by aspis drones. They rise on 
two rear legs, leaving the other four limbs to wield two weapons and 
two shields, increasing its AC to 2. All aspis are immune to cold and 
electrical damage: fire-based attacks cause only half damage, 

Aspis, Larva 

Aspis larvae attack with their perpetually ravenous jaws. 

Assassin Bug 

The male assassin bug attacks first with the female close to the battle. 
Those bitten must save vs. poison or that part of the body is para¬ 
lyzed for one hour The female attacks that same location the follow¬ 
ing round to inject ld6 + 6 eggs. In ldI2 + L2 hours, the eggs hatch, 
and each larva causes 1 point of damage per hour. After two weeks, 
the larva emerge as adults. Only powerful spells like wish and limited 
wish will erase the infestation. 

Bee, Worker 

Worker bees use their stinger in combat. The victim must save vs, 
poison or suffer and additional ld4 points of damage. Bees lose their 
stinger after one use and die in an hour. If encountered at the hive, 
there will be 20 times the normal number of bees. 


204 






Insect 


Bee, Soldier 

Soldier bees are identical to worker bees, except their sting causes 
more damage, and the victim must save with a “1 penalty. 

Bumblebee 

Bumblebee poison causes an additional Ido points ot damage unless a 
save vs. poison (with a ”1 penalty) is made. If encountered at or 
near the nest, there will be ld6+6 bumblebees, and a combative 
queen. The queen has Sd4 HD and a sting that causes Id8 points of 
damage. The poison from her sting causes an additional 2-8 points of 
damage if a save vs. poison at a “2 penalty is failed. Bumblebees do 
not lose their stingers after use* 

Cave Cricket 

If a group of people are within 20 feet of a chirping cave cricket, the 
noise drowns out all speech and vocal spell casting. The noise inhibits 
the victim's ability to hear approaching predators and enemies. 

Dragonfly 

Giant dragonflies gain a “3bonus to initiative rolls and a + 4 Armor 
Class bonus against missile weapons, A dragonfly scoops tiny- and 
small-sized creatures into its leg basket and devours them in midair. 
When captured, its victim is attacked automatically. When attacking 
man- or large-sized creatures, the dragonfly darts in to bite with its 
mandibles, and backs up, always facing its opponent. 

Dragonfly, Larva 

These larva surprise their prey 50% of the time. Their mandibles are 
covered with a rubbery organ when not in use; so even before the 
attack, they appear to be inoffensive, toothless creatures. 

Ear Seeker 

The ear seeker needs warm places to lay its eggs, favoring locations like 
ears. The creature lays S + Ld8 eggs that hatch in 4d6 hours. The larva eat 
the surrounding tissue, deafening the victim. Constantly burrowing 
deeper into the victim s head where food and warmth arc plentiful, the 
host has a 90% chance of dying m ld4 days. After this time, the ear 
seekers emerge from the infested ear as adults, A cure disease removes 
the infestation but does not return the loss of hearing. 

Firefriend Giant Firefly) 

In addition to its mandibles, the giant firefly can brighten its abdomen 
once every turn, creating a beam of greenish light that causes 5d4 points 
of damage; one-half damage if a save vs. wands is successful. 

Fly, Giant Bluebottle 

This breed of giant fly prefers carrion, offal, and the like. They are, 
however, attracted to sweet odors, and creatures covered with blood 
or open wounds. 

Fly Giant Horsefly 

The largest of all giant flies, the giant horsefly alights on any creature 
to attack for blood with its tuberous mouth. After biting, the giant 
horsefly causes an equal amount of damage the next round by draw¬ 
ing blood, unless driven off. 

Fyrefly 

When a fyrefly contacts flammable objects, these items must save vs. 
normal fire or be consumed. Persons in burning clothing suffer ld6 
points of damage. Hits that do not strike burnable material, cause I 
point of damage to the victim. 

Ho rax 

Horax attack in packs, gaining a -1 bonus to initiative rolls. Once a 
horax scores a hit, it maintains its hold, causing damage every round. 

Hornet, Giant 

The solitary giant hornet swoops down on its prey holding with its 
legs while its stinger repeatedly stabs the victim* A failed save vs* 
poison causes an additional 5d6 points of damage and 2db hours of 
paralyzation. Hornets do not lose their stingers when they attacks. 



Pernicon 

Pemicons attack by swarming victims and tearing at exposed flesh 
with their huge mandibles. Able to worm their way under clothing 
and armor, no one is completely safe from these creatures. When the 
swarm hits, the victim suffers IdlO points of damage and 1 point of 
Constitution, If the Constitution dips below 3, the victim falls uncon¬ 
scious; below 1 and the victim dies. One point of Constitution is re¬ 
covered per day, regardless of healing methods. 

Praying Mantis, Gargantuan 

The gargantuan praying mantis grabs prey, that inadvertently comes 
too dose, with its front spiny arms. Besides its two daws, it bites 
with its strong mandibles, removing and chewing flesh with each un¬ 
erring strike* 

Termite, Giant Harvester 

Groups of 30 or more worker termites are accompanied by soldiers. 
Soldier termites can spit an irritating liquid like kerosene once per 
turn at a range of 10 feet. This flammable liquid blinds creatures, for 
5d4 rounds, that do not save vs, poison, If ignited, termite spittle 
causes 4d4 points of damage. King termites have double range spittle 
and can use this attack every other round, but the queen lacks this 
ability. Both the queen and king (and the eggs? are guarded by twice 
the number of workers and soldiers encountered normally, and who 
attack with a +i to hit and a +5 bonus to morale rolls. 

Tick, Giant 

These creatures drop on victims from trees, stalactites, or rock for¬ 
mations, After the initial hit, the tick drains ldb hit points of blood 
every round until its drain total equals its hit point total. A victim has 
a 50% chance of contracting a fatal disease that kills the host in 2d4 
days unless a cure disease is cast. 

Wasp, Giant 

These cooperative insects attack with both their bite and stinger. The 
venom carried by wasps is identical to that held by the giant hornet. 
Wasps do not lose their stingers when they attack*

As individuals, velvet ants, grasshoppers. 

and locusts are rela- 


lively harmless. But in swarms, these insects can cause immense 
damage to fields and forests, as well as threatening the lives of all 
creatures in their path. 

Velvet Ants 

The velvet ant resembles a plump version of the common ant, 
except for the soft fuzz that covers its entire body. The fuzz is 
usually red or black, but it can also be yellow, brown, or orange. 

Combat: A velvet ant swarm eats everything in its path, animal 
matter as well as vegetation. To determine the size of a swarm, 
roll IdlQQ and multiply the result by 1,000. There are about 100 
ants per square foot; therefore, a swarm of 10.000 ants forms a 
block about 10 feet per side* 

If a swarm comes in contact with an obstacle, it turns 90 and 
continues. A victim in contact with a swarm has an 80% chance 
per round of being bitten and suffering ld4 points of damage. 

The victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or 
suffer intense pain for the next 2d4 turns, making all attack and 
damage rolls with a -2 penalty during this time. 

Each point of damage inflicted on an insect swarm kills ld20 
insects* They may be scattered with smoke or fire: immersion in 
water washes them off. Li half of a swarm is killed, the survivors 
attempt to scatter and hide. If an entire swarm is killed, award 
975 experience points. 

Grasshoppers and Locusts 

The grasshopper is about 2 inches in length and is usually green 
or brown in color. The grasshopper can make leaps of about four 
feet. Locusts are a type of grasshopper, with shorter antennae. 
They can rub their hind legs against their wings to produce a dis¬ 
tinctive chirp. 



Combat: Grasshopper and locust swarms fly from place to 
place in search of lush fields on which to settle and consume, 
These swarms move in straight lines and are easy to avoid. 

To determine the size of a grasshopper swarm, roll IdlQQ and 
multiply the result by 10,000. Multiply this result by 2 when de¬ 
termining the size of a locust swarm. There are about 20 grass- 
hoppers or locusts per square foot (for convenience, assume there 
are 20 insects per cubic foot when approximating the size of fly¬ 
ing swarm). 

A victim in contact with a grasshopper or locust swarm has a 
90% chance per round of being bitten and suffering 1 point of 
damage. Additionally, victims within a cloud of these insects 
have their vision reduced to 2d4 feet. 

Each point of damage inflicted on an insect swarm kills ld2Q 
insects. They may be scattered with smoke or fire; immersion in 
water washes them off* if half of a swarm is killed, the survivors 
attempt to scatter. 11 an entire swarm is killed, award 2,000 expe¬ 
rience points. 

H a bi tat/So riety: Insect swarms are migratory, sleeping at night 
wherever they happen to be. Females lay up to 100 eggs every 
year* These insects have no leaders or any specialized workers. 
They do not collect treasure. 

Ecology: Velvet ants eat seeds, grasses, and meat, especially en¬ 
joying carrion. The poison of vel vet ants renders them inedible to 
carnivores. 

Grasshoppers and locusts prefer seeds and grains. Snakes, 
mice, birds, and spiders are among these insects' numerous natu¬ 
ral enemies. Grasshoppers and locusts can be eaten by carni¬ 
vores.

The term "intellect devourer" refers only to this creature's adult 
form: its larva is an ustilagor. Both resemble a brain on four legs. 


The body of the intellect devourer has a crusty protective cover¬ 
ing, and its legs are bestial, jointed, and clawed. The ustilagor’s 
body is soft and moist and usually covered with a gray fungus: it 
has a 3Toot-k&gt;ng tendril at the front, and its legs are spindly and 
coraLIike. Though both forms are about brain-sized, the adult 
can use psionics to alter its size. 

Combat: The ustilagor attacks by striking with Us flexible tend¬ 
ril, The tendril secretes an alkaline substance which causes 
ld4+l damage on a successful hit, as well as another ld4 + l 
damage the following round, unless the victim makes a successful 
saving throw vs, poison. The creature is quite agile, and can 
jump and dart quickly. 

The ustilagor can also attack psionically, first making contact 
with a victim a mind. It uses aversion to give a victim an aversion 
to fungus or Lo a certain area; id insinuation to effectively para¬ 
lyze the victim: or tdempathic projection to increase an oppo¬ 
nent's dislike or distrust of companions. 

Despite its psionic prowess, the ustilagor cannot be attacked 
mentally (magically or psionically) except by psionic blast. Its 
fungal growth interferes with and prevents mental attacks, pro¬ 
tects the ustilagor from drying out. prevents cerebral parasites 
from attacking, and makes the creature immune to fungal attacks 
and any power that reads or affects an aura. 

The adult form also prefers to attack with psionics, though its 
three-taloned paws can all be used in the same round, as the crea¬ 
ture jumps on an opponent and rakes. 

Aside from its regular psionic powers (see below), the adult intel¬ 
lect devourer has specialized forms of three psionic powers; these are 
constantly in effect and cost no PSPs, but they do count as psionic 
activity for detection purposes. Through a special form of energy 
containment, the intellect devourer is immune to damage from nor¬ 
mal and magical fins, and takes only one hit point per die of electri¬ 
cal damage: a form of split personality is always in effect, allowing 
the creature to attack with psionics and claws in the same round; 
and it has psionic sense with a 60 foot range. 

The intellect devourer is immune to weapons with less than a 
+3 enchantment, and takes only 1 point of damage per hit from 
those weapons which can harm them, A death $pell has only a 


25% chance of success, but power word: kill is effective. A pro¬ 
tection from evil keeps the intellect devourer at bay, and bright 
light (including that caused by fire) drives it away. 

An intellect devourer hunts and stalks psionic creatures. After 
killing a psionic victim, it sometimes uses reduction to enter the 
body, devour the brain, and occupy its place. It reads the victim's 
mind as it devours it, then animates the body from within, using 
it to find other minds to attack and devour.

Intellect devourers have the following psionic powers; ustilagor 
have only those powers marked by asterisks: 

* P$yehornetabtilism ■ Sciences: ectoplasmic form'. Devo¬ 
tions: body equilibrium*, chameleon power, expansion, reduc¬

* Telepathy - Sciences: domination, mind I ink. Devotions: 
aversion*, contact*, ego whip, ESP, id insinuation*, tdempathic 
projection** 

Habitat/Society; Intellect devourers dwell beneath the ground or 
in dismal wilderness areas. Their reproductive method is un¬ 
known. The intellect devourer rarely protects iLs young, and may 
even devour them. Ustilagor develop a symbiotic relationship 
with a bizarre fungus which feeds on residual thought emana¬ 
tions from the ustilagor's victims. An ustilagor becomes an adult 
by consuming the brain of a psionic creature. 

Ecology: Mind flayers raise intellect devourers. treating the usti¬ 
lagor as culinary delights, and using adults as watch dogs. Both 
forms of the creature can be used as components in items and 
potions related to ESP and mind control.

The invisible stalker is a creature from the elemental plane of Air. 
Those encountered on the Prime Material plane have almost al¬ 
ways been summoned by wizards to fulfill a specific task. 

The true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Ma¬ 
terial, Astral, or Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be 
perceived as a shimmering air mass which looks much like the 
refraction effect caused by hot air passing in front of cold 

Invisible stalkers understand the common speech of men, but 
can not speak it. They can converse only in their own language, 
which sounds much like the roaring and whooshing of a great 
wind storm. 

Combat: Invisible stalkers attack by using the air itself as a 
weapon. It is capable of creating a sudden, intense vortex that 
batters a victim for 4-16 (4d4) points of damage. Such attacks 
affect a single victim on the same plane as the invisible stalker. 

Due to their invisibility, these creatures impose a -6 penalty 
on the surprise rolls of those they choose to attack. Similarly all 
opponents who are unable to see or detect invisible foes are at a 
~2 on their attack rolls, Although they are fully imjisibfc on the 
Prime Material plane, their outlines can be dimly perceived on 
the Astral or Ethereal planes. 

Invisible stalkers can only be killed on the elemental plane of 
Air. If attacked on another plane, they automatically return to 
their home plane when their total hit points are exceeded by the 
damage they suffered 

Habitat/Societyi Little is known about the lives of these crea¬ 
tures on their home plane. It is assumed that they are similar to 
normal air elemental* when encountered there, 

Those present on the material plane are there as the result of a 
conjuration by some wizard. This magic causes the creature to 
serve its summoner for a time. The conjurer retains full com¬ 
mand of the stalker until it either fulfills its duties or is defeated 
and driven back to its home plane. Once given a task, an invisi¬ 
ble stalker is relentless. They are faultless trackers who can detect 
any trail less than a day old. If ordered to attack, they will do so 
with great fury and will cease Lheir efforts only upon their own 
destruction or the direct orders of their master. Once their mis¬ 
sion is accomplished, the creature is free to return to its home 
plane. 

The in visible stalker is, at best, an unwilling servant. It resents 
any task assigned to it, although brief, uncomplicated labors 


may be seen as something of a diversion and thus undertaken 
with little resentment. Tasks that require a week or more of its 
time will drive the invisible stalker to pervert the stated intent of 
the command. Such commands must be carefully worded and 
come from a powerful wizard. An invisible stalker may look for 
a loop hole in the command as a means of striking back at its 
master. For example, a simple command such as 'keep me safe 
from all harm" may result in the stalker carrying the conjurer 
back to the elemental plane of air and leaving him there in a well 
hidden location. 

Each day of the invisible stalker's indenturedness there is a 1 % 
cumulative chance that the creature will seek a means to pervert 
its commands and free itself of servitude. If no option is open, the 
creature must continue to serve. 

Ecology: Invisible stalkers are a species unwillingly transplant¬ 
ed to the Prime Material plane. They are slaves whose terms of 
servitude dominate their brief stays. Those who have been sub¬ 
jected to great hardship, assigned very difficult tasks, or w r ho 
have faced death at the hands of humanoids, tend to retain a dis¬ 
trust or outright hatred of them. Those that have had an easy 
time during past periods of service or who are first time arrivals 
on the Prime Material plane may be easier to deal with. Such 
feelings may carry over to influence encounters with humanoids 
traveling in the aerial plane. Anyone who has befriended an in¬ 
visible stalker in the past will f ind that voyages through the plane 
of elemental Air are far less hazardous than they might otherwise 
have been. 

Invisible stalkers only obey those who actually summon them 
and few wizards can be commissioned to summon such a being 
on another's behalf. Some mercenary wizards have been able to 
construct the necessary summons onto scrolls that are usable by 
others. These sell for between 5,000 and 10,000 gp and are very 
dangerous to use. Even the slightest error can cause users of such 
scrolls to come to a tragic end.

Ixitxachitl are a race of intelligent, aquatic beings that resemble 
small manta rays with barbed tails. They have an evil disposition 
and worship evil powers: they love to hunt marine humanoids, 
and then sacrifice or devour their catch. 

[xitxachitl is both singular and plural; it is properly pro¬ 
nounced ish-it-SHACH-ith though many refer to them as icks-it- 
ZACH-if-ul or even icks-ii-zuh-dut-ul. 

Combat: A favored tactic of ixitxachitl is to hide in the sand of 
the ocean floor, wait for prey to pass by, then spring up and bite 
them. The creatures are not very stealthy, and this tactic gives 
them normal chances to surprise their prey. 

Some ixitxachitl act as priests, learning special versions of 
spells which have only verbal components, from the following 
spheres: Charm, Divination, Elemental (Water), Necromantic* 
Healing, Protection, and Sun (Darkness only). For every 10 ixitx- 
achitl encountered, there is one ixitxachitl with the abilities of a 
2nd-level priest. For every 20, there is an individual with the 
powers of a 3rd-levei priest. For every 50, there is one with 2 +2 
Hit Dice and the abilities of a 5th-Ievel priest, 

When more than 50 are encountered, they are led by a high 
priest with 4+4 HD and 8th4evel ability. The high priest is ac¬ 
companied by two guardian priests, each with 3+3 HD and 6th- 
level ability. Guardian and high priests often have treasure type 
U, with magical items that can be used without hands. 

For every 20 ixitxachitl encountered, there is a 50% chance 
they will be accompanied by a vampiric ixitxachitL One in one 
hundred of these are greater vampiric ixitxachitl, but these are 
rarely encountered outside a city. 

Habitat Society i Though they are occasionally encountered in 
rivers, ixitxachitl live in shallow ocean depths, They usually have 
a community of 10-100 individuals, which lives in a maze of cor¬ 



ridors inside a coral reef. A community usually has 20-200 hu¬ 
manoid slaves to do heavy labor for them, such as carving corri¬ 
dors. The community's entrance b hidden. 

Large communities that have strong leaders, like a greater 
vampiric ixitxachitl, are sometimes built on the ocean floor* 
These large cities hold pyramids and other buildings which serve 
as lairs for small groups of the creatures. Rumors tell of ixitxa¬ 
chitl cities with populations in the thousands. The strongest ixitx- 
achitl in the community leads its religious hierarchy, which 
controls the lives of the populace* 

Ecology: Ixitxachitl have no natural predators, though they have 
many enemies, ranging from sahuagin to humans. They are vi¬ 
cious predators who prey on almost any living creature; they of¬ 
ten over hunt a region, eliminating all life forms, forcing the 
ixitxachitl to find new hunting grounds. 

Vampiric Ixitxachitl 

These rare creatures are even more dangerous than the others* 
Each has 2+2 HD and regenerates 3 hp per round. In addition to 
its normal damage, the bite of a vampiric ixitxachitl drains one 
life energy level. They look no different than other ixitxachitL 
and often serve as guards tor their leaders. 

Greater Vampiric Ixitxachitl 

These creatures are rare indeed- they achieve greater status only 
by being bitten by an existing greater vampiric ixitxachitl. These 
creatures have 8 + 8 Hit Dice. They drain two life energy levels 
with a bite (except when the bite is performed on another vam¬ 
piric member of their race), A greater vampiric Ixitxachitl is the 
center of the large cities of its kind; it is their tyrannical ruler and 
they worship it as the incarnation of a greater power. Captives 
are brought to it to be drained of life.

The jackalwere is a terrible and savage creature which preys on 
unsuspecting travelers and other demihumans that it can am¬ 
bush. Its ability to alter its shape at will makes it a most danger¬ 
ous foe. 

The jackalwere can be found in any ot three forms, showing no 
preference for any one over the others. The first of these is that of 
a normal jackal. In this form it will often run and hunt with jack¬ 
al packs. Its second form is a six foot talk half-human /half-jackal 
hybrid which stands erect. In its third form, the [ackalwere is 
physically indistinguishable from normal human beings. The ex¬ 
act physical characteristics of the jackal were s human form varies 
according to the desires of the monster 

Combat: In its jackal form, the monster conforms to the statis¬ 
tics presented elsewhere in this volume. A careful observer, how¬ 
ever, will find that Lhe creature does not act ini the manner typical 
of a normal jackal, for it is far more aggressive. 

In its hybrid form, the jackalwere can attack with either its bite 
or with any weapons in hand. Because it has a great thirst for the 
blood of humans and demihumans, the jackalwere will use its 
bite whenever possible. Still. it will not avoid the use of weapons 
that will insure its victory in combat. 

In its human form, the jackalwere can only attack with weap¬ 
ons, Although it may employ any manner of weapon, it greatly 
enjoys those which will cut and tear the flesh of its victims. In 
some cases, a jackalwere has been known to feed on the bodies of 
fallen enemies without reverting to its jackal or hybrid form. 

In all forms, the jackalwere possesses a magical gaze. If an un¬ 
suspecting victim meets the monster's gaze, the victim must save 
versus spell or fall deeply asleep: the effect is identical to that of 
the steep spell. Note that hostile, scared, or excited people are not 
considered to be unsuspecting. 

The jackalweres special defenses also function in all three 
forms. Only +1 or better magkal weapons or those forged horn 
cold iron will cause any damage to the jackalwere. Jackalweres 
revert to their jackal form after death. 



the suspicions of its target, often pretending to be injured or 
otherwise in need, until it can employ its gaze attack. If this fails 
and the jackalwere is confronted with forceful resistance it will 
decide whether to flee or press the attack based on its estimation 
of its victim's strength. 

The jackalwere spends its life hunting and killing any humans 
and demihumans it comes across. They roam the world in either 
the jackal or human form, seeking humanoids to kill, eat, and 
rob. They are sly creatures and masters of deceit. 

Jackalweres are able to mate only in their jackal form. They 
may produce offspring either by mating with true jackals or oth¬ 
er jackal weres, but only those young who were not of mixed 
blood will be jackal weres themselves. The children of a jackal 
and jackalwere mating will be jackals, although they will be un¬ 
naturally aggressive. 

Female jackal weres give birth in five months to a litter of 1-4 
pups. These are identical to jackal pups although they initially 
have 1 Hit Die. The pups grow quickly and add an additional Hit 
Die each year. Their jackal forms reach full growth at three years 
and pups are locked in that form for their first two years. At age 
two they gain the ability to assume their hybrid form and at age 
three they gain the ability to assume a human form which Is ap¬ 
parently nine years of age. The human form grows at triple the 
normal human rate. If a parent in human form is discovered with 
its pups, it will often try to pass them off as pets. 

Jackalweres may (20%) travel in the company of 1-6 normal 
jackals. Although these jackals are normal in every regard, the 
influence of the jackalwere tends to make them more fierce than 
normal. Jackals under the influence of a jackalwere will be 
hunters instead of scavengers. 

Ecology: Jackalweres will not serve any but the most evil of hu¬ 
manoids. and even then only if they have the opportunity to slay 
more humans and demihumans than they could on their own. 


Habitat,'Society: When the jackalwere locates a victim it will 
assume human shape and approach its prey. It will seek to ease

Kenku are bipedal humanoid birds that use their powers to an¬ 
noy and inconvenience the human and demihuman races. 

The typical kenku resembles a humanoid hawk wearing hu¬ 
man clothing. Kenku have both arms and wings. The wings are 
usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a distance 
for a large backpack. Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet. The feathers 
are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face 

markings. The eyes are a 

brilliant yellow. 

Combat; All kenku have the skills of 4th-Ievel thieves. They are 
expert fighters and usually attack with a scimitar or quarterstaff. If 


unarmed, they attack with either pair of claws (two attacks for ld4 
points of damage apiece) and their beak Cld6 points of damage). If 
they are on foot, they use the hand daws. If in flight, the foot daws 
are used. They do not usually kill unless their own lives are threat¬ 
ened by the survival of their foe. All kenku have weII-developed dis¬ 
guise skills. They have a 50% chance of passing for human, 
although their disguises often have telltale large noses. 

A 3-Hit Die kenku has one Ist-level wizard spell, usually magic 
missile. Once each 30 days a kenku can shape change and retain 
that shape for up to seven days. A 4-Hit Die kenku has an extra 
tsTlevei spell often shocking grasp. They gain the innate ability 
to become invisible with no limitation on duration or frequency 
of use. A 5-Hit Dice kenku leader gains an additional 2nd-Ievel 
mage spell usually mirror image or web r and the innate ability to 
cg/I lightning (the same as the 3rd-level priest spell). 

Habitat-Society: Kenku are a secretive race that lives among 
the human and demihuman races without the bulk of the popula¬ 
tion ever being aware of their presence. 

If a group of kenku is encountered, the group's size determines its 
composition. A group of five or fewer contains two 2-Hit Dice and 
three 3-Hit Dice kenku. A group of six or seven has a leader with 4 
Hit Dice, three kenku with 3 Hit Dice, and the rest have 2 Hit Dice. 
A group of eight kenku adds a supreme leader of 5 Hit Dice, 

Kenku do not speak; although they may give out bird-like 
squawks, these are gibberish, Kenku apparently communicate 
with each other telepathically, They are adept at symbols, sign 



language, and pantomime. 

Kenku may appear to be friendly, helpful, and even generous. 
They freely give treasure to humans and demihumans, but it is 
rarely genuine and crumbles into dust within a day. They may 
offer nonverbal advice to humanoids, but this is carefully de¬ 
signed to mislead, It may actually lead the party into dangers and 
difficulties they might otherwise have avoided. As a rule of 
thumb, kenku have only a 5% chance of actually helping people. 

The actual structure of kenku society is elusive. The kenku 
themselves either refuse to comment or lie. Those kenku lairs 
that have been encountered tend to be small underground cham¬ 
bers or cave complexes. It is believed that large caverns deep un¬ 
derground may hold sizeable kenku communities, including 
individuals of 6 Hit Dice or more and with greater magical 
powers. 

Kenku reproduction is similar to that of large birds. The female 
lays a clutch of two to four eggs that hatch after 60 days. New hatch¬ 
lings are featherless, helpless, and have 1 hit point each. Hatchlings 
grow swiftly and gain 1 hit point each month. Within six to eight 
months they have adult feathers and are able to function indepen¬ 
dently as 1-Hit Die kenku. At this point they can begin to learn to 
use the skills they need as adults (thieving, fighting, disguise). If a 
hatchling is captured, it either lacks this training or has whatever 
minimal skills it acquired before capture. 

\bunger kenku (3 Hit Dice or less) are reckless and prone to 
audacious plans. They have been known to pass themselves off 
as gods and collect the worshipers's offerings. Older kenku are 
more reserved and cunning, preferring to kidnap wealthy hu¬ 
mans and demihumans as a source of revenue. 

Ecology: Domestically raised kenku are prized as servants, 
Kenku eggs are commonly sold tor 250 gp P hatchlings for 300-500 
gp. However, this is a form of slave trade, with all the attendant 
complications. If a kenku discovers captive kenku, it will attempt 
to secretly rescue the captive and, if possible, kidnap the slave 
trader or owner. They will avenge slain kenku.

The ki-rin is a noble creature that roams the sky in search of good 
deeds to reward or malefactors to punish. 

The ki-rin s coat is covered with luminous golden scales like a 
sunrise on a clear morning. The thick mane and tail are a darker 
gold, live horn and hooves are gold tinged with pink. The eyes 
are a deep violet The ki-rin has a melodious voice. 

Ki-rin speak their own language. Since they are telepathic, 
they are able to mentally or verbally converse with virtually any 
living thing. 

Combat: The ki-rin can physically attack with its powerful hooves 
(2d4 points of damage each) or a unicorn-like hom that gains a +3 
bonus to its attack roll and inflicts 3d6 points of damage. 

They can employ spells as if they were 18th4evel mages. Each 
day they may use nine Ist-level spells, eight 2nd-level spells, sev¬ 
en 3rd-level spells, etc. , all the way to one 9th-level spell. 

The ki-rin's telepathy enables them to read conscious thoughts 
and are thus nearly impossible to surprise. The ki-rin also possess 
a variety of magical powers that can each be used once each day. 
They can create nutritious food and beverages for 2dl2 people, 
as well as 32 cubic feet of soft goods or 18 cubic feet of wooden 
items. These are permanent creations. The ki-rin can create metal 
items with a total weight of up to 2,000 gp weight, but such items 
have very short life spans. In general the harder the substance, 
the shorter the life span; for example, adamantite lasts an hour, 
while gold lasts ld4 +1 days. 

The ki-rin can also generate illusions with audial, visual and 
olfactory components. These illusions last without further con¬ 
centration until the illusion is either magically dispelled or dis¬ 
rupted by disbelief. The ki-rin can assume gaseous form t wind 
walk, summon weather, and call lightning as well. When a ki-rin 
conjures things of the sky or things that involve the air, the crea¬ 
ture or magic produced is at twice normal strength, including hit 
points and the damage inflicted by its attacks. They can enter the 
Ethereal and Astral planes at will. 



Habitat Society; The kj-rm are a race of aerial creatures that 
rarely set hoof on solid ground- Only the males ever approach 
the ground. No encounter with a female ki-rin has ever been re¬ 
corded, although it is certain such beings exist. Likewise no 
young ki-rln has ever been encountered, thus details of their re¬ 
production are unknown. Ki-rin are reticent about these topics, 

Ki-rin come to the aid of humanoids if asked properly or if such 
beinp are faced with a powerful, extremely evil being. Ki-rin believe 
in self-improvement, though, and do not casually come to a human- 
oids aid except in the most dire of circumstances* 

Ki-rin sustain themselves by creating their own food and drink. 
They are highly imaginative with their creations. They may estab¬ 
lish a lair high atop a mountain or plateau. Such sites are virtually 
impossible to reach without resort to flight or climbing. The lairs 
may have an stony exterior crafted from local materials. It is en¬ 
hanced by magically created wood and stout doth. The interiors 
tend to be luxurious. The ki-rin are able to craft fine cloth, tapes¬ 
tries, pillows, and other comforts. An occupied lair is kept dean 
by carefully controlled winds that sweep out debris. 

Although ki-rin are generous and not avaricious, they still tend 
to accumulate treasure. These may be their own creations, gifts 
from friends and allies, souvenirs of past travels and exploits, fines 
levied against malefactors, or booty taken from vanquished foes. 

Ecology: Ki-rin spend most of their time pursuing their own af¬ 
fairs. They often monitor the activities of powerful evil creatures 
and beings. If such beings become too malevolent, the ki-rin act 
against them. 

Ki-rin may reward allies or needy individuals by creating food 
and valuables. 

The intact skin of a ki-rin is worth 25,000 gp. Possession of such 
a item is dangerous, due to the retribution that may be visited 
upon the possessor by other ki-rin, sympathetic humanoids, or in¬ 
telligent lawful good monsters.

The kirre is one of the more vicious animals of the forests and 
jungles of Athas. Resembling a tiger in many ways, the kirre is a 
beast not to be trifled with. 

At first glance, the kirre looks like a great cat, but upon clos¬ 
er examination, the differences quickly become clear, The kirre 
is 8 Feet in length and has eight legs, each ending in paws which 
sport very sharp daws. The kirre also has large horns on either 
sides of its head and a sharp barbed tail spike often used as a 
weapon. The mouth of the kirre is large and has sharp, canine 
teeth, which are used mostly for tearing food that has been 
killed. The kirre is a fur-covered animal with coloration similar 
to a tiger {both are striped). But where are a tiger is striped in 
black and orange, the kirre is striped in brown and grey. This 
coloration is consistent all over the kirre's body, with the excep¬ 
tion of its face, which is all grey. The yellow eyes of this crea¬ 
ture against the dark grey fur of its face create a fearsome 
appearance. 

Combat; Being predators by nature, kirre are very well equipped 
for combat. This creature is very quick in melee combat, and 
therefore receives a -1 modifier to its initiative rolls, if the DM is 
using the "Optional Modifiers to Initiative", kirres are treated as 
small creatures, receiving only a +3 modifier, instead of the nor¬ 
mal + 6 for large creatures. 

During each round of combat, a kirre can attack up to seven 
times, using its limbs, teeth, horns, and tail as weapons. It first 
attacks with its foremost claws, followed by Us bite and horn at¬ 
tack. It then attacks with its secondary claws and its tail. Each 
daw does ld4 points of damage, both the bite and tail do ld6 
points, and the horn attack does ld8 points. 



Uke many of the creatures of the Athas, kirres have natural 
psionic powers. Instead of its multiple attacks, each round the 
kirre can use one of its psionic powers as can any normal psionic 
creature. Also, the kirre has natural psionic defense modes that 
are always considered to be "on7 These provide the creature it 
with a powerful defense against psionic opponents (assuming the 
kirre has enough PSPs to power the defense mode being used), 

Habitat/Sodety: Kirres are normally solitary creatures, until the 
approach of their mating season, at which time a male and fe¬ 
male will join and produce offspring. Kirre litters number from 
three to five young. Kirres are mammals, and females produce 
milk for their young. Young kirres survive on milk for the first 
five months, at which point they begin to eat solid food such as 
small forest animals and other mammals. 

When the female is ready to give birth, both she and her mate 
will make a den in a remote area of the forest inhere they will be 
unlikely to be disturbed. During the first five months after birth, 
both the male and female protect their den ferociously, attempt¬ 
ing to kill any creature who threatens their young. 

EcoSogy: Kirre are a favorite game of many hunting tribes of 
races who live in the forests of Athas, The meal from kirres is 
some of the finest on all of Athas, and it is sought after by many. 
Aside from a source of food, the kirre also has other uses when 
killed. The creature's horns can be cut off and used as spear 
heads; in some cases, they can be carved into ornate daggers. .Al¬ 
so, the tail of a kirre has a sharp, bone spike at its end that can be 
fashioned into either an arrow head or a dart,.

Koboids are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously 
contest the human and demi-human races for living space and food. They 
especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight. 

Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobo Ids have scaly hides that range 
from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and 
stagnant water Their eyes glow tike a bright red spark and they ha ve two 
small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the koboids' fondness 
for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like 
tails, and their language i which sounds like small dogs yapping), these 
fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, 
for what they lack in *i£o and strength they make up in ferocity and 
tenacity, 

Koboids speak their own language: some (73%) speak ore and goblin. 

Combat: The kobold approach to combat uses overwhelming odds or 
trickery, Koboids will attack gnomes on sight, but will think twice about 
attacking humans, elves or dwarves unless the koboids outnumber them 
by at least two to one, They often hurl javelins and spears, preferring not 
to dose until they see that their enemies have been weakened. 

Koboids attack in overwhelming waves. Should the koboids be re¬ 
duced to only a three to two ratio in their favor, they must make a mor¬ 
ale check. Koboids are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when 
possible. 

Tins diminutive race also enjoys setting up concealed pits with spikes, 
crossbows, and other mechanical traps. They usually have view ports 
and murder holes near these traps so that they can pour flaming oil, mis¬ 
sile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims. 

Kobold war bands are armed with spiked dubs, axes, javelins, short 
swords and spears. Their shields are seldom metal, but are normally wood 
or wicker. Chiefs and guards tend to have the best weapons available. 

Koboids have 60-foot infra vision but do not see well in bright sunlight, 
suffering a “1 on their attack rolls. 

Habitat'Society Koboids live In dark, damp places underground and in 
overgrown forests They can be found in almost any climate. As koboids are 
good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement. 

The average kobold tribe has 40 * 400 (4dI0 x 101 adult males. For eve¬ 
ry 40 koboids in a band there will be one leader and two bodyguards {AC 



6: HD 1 —1; hp 4 each; damage 1-6). In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) 
bodyguards, females equal lo 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of 
the males and 30-300 (idlOxlO) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 
guards {AC 5: HD 1+1; hp 7 each; damage 1-8) Further, there is a 65% 
chance there will be guard animals: {70%} 2-5 wild boars {AC 7; HD 
3 +3; damage 3d4 gore) or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels (AC 6: HD 3 + 3; dam¬ 
age 2d6 bite and blood drain). There may be one or more shamans, 
Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war bands 
based on specific clans. As many as 10 families can be part of a dan, and 
each clan usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius 
from the lair. Koboids recover treasure from the bodies of their victims 
and often carry them back to their lair as food In some instances, ko¬ 
boids will not kill their victims, but will sell them as slaves. 

Koboids are distrustful of strangers. They hate brownies, pixies, 
sprites and gnomes. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner. 

Ecology: Perhaps koboids are so cruel because they are easy prey for 
larger humanoids and hungry monsters. They have many enemies, and 
even the dwarves have had to admit that the numerous kobold-goblin 
wars have kept the number of goblins down tn a safe tevel. 

Koboids can live 135 years, 

Urd 

Lfrds are distant relatives of koboids. Three feet tall, with short Ivory 
horns, their bodies* are frail and covered with mottled yellow to brick red 
scales. Their leathery, batlike wings span S feet. 

Urds have 60-foot infravision and prefer to hunt at night, dropping 
jagged stones (2-3 pounds each) (rum the air. Unsuspecting victims are 
AC 10 for the attack roll. Actively dodging opponents are considered AC 
2 before modifications to Dexterity. Rocks cause 2d4 points of damage. 
Some urds (25%) carry light sprears {Id4 damage), 

A band of 20 urds is accompanied by a subchieftain (AC 7, 7 hp). Urd 
flocks of 100 or more include the chieftain (10 hp, 50% have magical 
leather armor L Urd lairs contain idb shamans able to speak with bats as 
per speak uiiffi animals. 

Urd life spans can exceed 100 years, but they rarely live past 50.

Kuo-toa are an ancient race of fish-men that dwells underground 
and harbors a deep hatred of surface dwellers and sunlight. 

A kuo-toan presents a cold and horrible appearance. A typical 
specimen looks much like a human body, albeit a paunchy one, 
covered in scales and topped with a fish's head. The huge fish 
eyes tend to swivel in different directions when observing an area 
or creature. The hands and feet are very long, with three fingers 
and an opposing digit, partially webbed. The legs and arms are 
short for the body size. Its coloration is pale grey, with under- 
tones of tan or yellow in males only. The skin has a sheen from its 
slimy covering. The color darkens when the kuo-toan is angry 
and pales when it is badly frightened, A strong odor of dead fish 
follows it around, 

It wears no clothing, only leather harnesses for its weapons 
and gear. Typically, a kuo-toan warrior carries daggers, spears, 
shields, harpoons and weighted throwing nets. 

Kuo-toa speak the strange subterranean trade language com¬ 
mon to most intelligent underworld dwellers. Additionally, they 
speak their own arcane tongue and have empathic contact with 
most fish. Their religious speech is a corruption of the language 
used on the elemental plane of Water: if a kuo-toan priest is in a 
group of kuo-toa, it is 75% unlikely that a creature native to the 
plane of Water will attack, for the priest will request mercy in the 
name of the Sea Mother, bllbdoolpoolp. 

Combat: These creatures normally travel in well-armed bands . If 
more than 20 kuo-toa are encountered, it Is 50% likely that they 
are within ld6 miles of their lair. For every four normal warriors 
encountered there is an additional fighter of 3rd or 4th level. For 
every eight normal fighters there is an additional fighter ol 5th or 
6th level. For every 12 normal kuo-toa in the group there is a 
cleric/thief of ld4 + 3 levels each. If more than 20 normal fighters 
are encountered, the group is a war consisting of the following: 

One IQth-kvel fighter as Captain 
Two fJth-level fighters as Lieutenants 
Four 3rd/3rd-level fighter' thief Whips

The whips are fanatical devotees of the Sea Mother goddess of 
the kuo-toa. They inspire the troops to stand firm and fight with¬

It is 50% probable that any kuo-toan priest above 6th level is 
armed with a pincer staff. This is a 5-foot-long pole topped by a 
three-foot-long claw. If the user scores a hit, the claw has dosed 
upon the opponent, making escape impossible. The weapon can 
be used only on enemies with a girth range between an elf and a 
gnolL It is 10% probable that both arms are pinned by the claw 
and 40% probable that one arm is trapped. If the victim is right 
handed, the daw traps the left hand 75% of the time. Trapped 
opponents lose shield and Dexterity bonuses. If the weapon arm 
is trapped, the victim cannot attack and the Dexterity bonus is 
lost, but the shield bonus remains. 

The harpoon is mostly used only by higher level fighters. It is a 
wickedly barbed throwing weapon with a 30 yard range. It inflicts 
2d6 points of damage, exdusive of bonuses. Victims must roll a suc¬ 
cessful saving throw of 13 + on ld20 to avoid being snagged by the 
weapon. Man-sized or smaller beings who fail this saving throw are 
jerked off their feet and stunned for ld4 rounds. The kuo-toan who 
is attached to his weapon by a stout cord, then tries to haul in its 
victim and slay him with a dagger thrust. 

Kuo-toan shields are made of special boiled leather and are 
treated with a unique glue-like substance before a battle. Anyone 
who attacks a kuo-toan from the front has a 25% chance of get¬ 
ting his weapon stuck fast. The chance of the victim treeing the 
weapon is the same as his chance for opening doors. 

Hit probability for kuo-toa is the same as that of a human of 
similar level, but males also gain a +1 bonus to both attack rolls 
and damage rolls when using a weapon, due to Strength, When 
fighting with a dagger only, kuo-toa can bite, which causes 
Ld4 +1 points of damage. 

When two or more kuo-toan priests or priest/thieves operate 
together, they can generate a lightmng stroke by joining hands. 
The bolt is two feet wide and hits only one target unless by mis¬ 
chance a second victim gets in the way, The bolt inflicts 6 points 


215 










Kuo-Toa 


of damage per priest, half that if a saving throw vs. spell is suc¬ 
cessful. The chances of such a stroke occurring is 10% cumula¬ 
tive per caster per round. 

The special defenses of these creatures include skin secretions, 
which gives attempts to grapple, grasp, tie, or web a kuo-toan 
only a 25% chance of success. Despite their eyes being set on the 
sides of their heads, they have excellent independent monocular 
vision, with a 180-degree field of vision and the ability to spot 
movement even though the subject is invisible, astral, or ethere¬ 
al. Thus, by maintaining complete motionlessness, a subject can 
avoid detection. Kuo-toa also have 60-foot infravision and have 
the ability to sense vibrations up to 10 yards away. They are sur¬ 
prised only on a 1 on the IdlO surprise roll. 

Kuo-toa are totally immune to poison and are not affected by 
paralysis. Spells that generally affect only humanoid types have 
no effect on them. Electrical attacks cause half damage, or none if 
the saving throw' is successful; magic missiles cause only 1 point 
of damage; Illusions are useless against them. However, kuo-toa 
hate bright light and suffer a -1 penalty to their attack roll in such 
circumstances as daylight or light spells. They suffer full damage 
from fire attacks and save with a -2 penalty against them. 

Sometimes kuo-toa are encountered in small bands journeying 
in the upper world to kidnap humans for slaves and sacrifices. 
Such parties are sometimes also found in dungeon labyrinths that 
connect to the extensive system of underworld passages and ca¬ 
verns that honeycomb the crust of the earth. Only far below the 
surface of the earth can the intrepid explorer find the caverns in 
which the kuo-toa build their underground communities. 

Habitat Society: Kuo-toa spawn as do fish, and hatchlings, or 
fingerlings as they call their young, are raised in pools until their 
amphibian qualities develop, about one year after hatching. The 
young, now a foot or so high, are then able to breathe air and 
they are raised in pens according to their sex and fitness. There 
are no families, as we know them, in kuo-toan society. 

Especially fit fingerlings, usually of noble spawning, are trained 
for the priesthood as priests, priest thieves, or special celibate 
monks. The latter are called "monitors" whose role is to control the 
community members who become violent or go insane. The moni¬ 
tor is capable of attacking to subdue or kill. A monitor has 56 hit 
points, attacks as a 7th-!evel fighter and has the following additional 
abilities; twice the normal movement rate, AC 1, and receives four 
attacks per round—two barehanded for 2d4 points of damage (dou¬ 
ble if trying to subdue) and two attacks with teeth for ld4 +■1 points 
of damage. One hand/bite attack occurs according to the initiative 
roll, the other occurs at the end of the round. 

Subdued creatures cannot be larger than eight feet tall and 500 
pounds. Subduing attacks cause only half real damage, but when 
the points of damage inflicted equal the victim's total, the crea* 
ture is rendered unconscious for 3d4 rounds. 

Kuo-toan communities do not generally cooperate, though 
they have special places of worship in common. These places are 
usually for intergroup trade, councils, and worship of the Sea 
Mother, so they are open to all kuo-toa. These religious com¬ 
munities, as well as other settlements, are open to draw and their 
servants, for the dark elves provide useful goods and services, 
though the draw are both feared and hated by the kuo-toa. This 
leads to many minor skirmishes and frequent kidnappings be¬ 
tween the peoples. The illithids {mind flayers) are greatly hated 
by the kuo-toa and they and their allies are attacked on sight. 

The ancient kuo-toa once inhabited the shores and islands of 
the upper world, but as the race of mankind grew more numer¬ 
ous and powerful, these men-fish were slowly driven to remote 
regions. Continual warfare upon these evil, human-sacrifIcing 
creatures threatened to exterminate the species, for a number of 
powerful beings were aiding mankind, their sworn enemies. 
Some kuo-toa sought refuge in sea cavems and secret subter¬ 


ranean waters, and while their fellows were being slaughtered, 
these few prospered and developed new powers to adapt to their 
lightless habitat. The seas contained other fierce and evil crea¬ 
tures, however, and the deep-dwelling kuo-toa were eventually 
wiped out, leaving only those in the underworld to carry on, un¬ 
noticed and eventually forgotten by mankind. But the remaining 
kuo-toa have not forgotten mankind, and woe to any who fall 
into their slimy dutches. 

Now the kuo-toa are haters of sunlight and are almost never en¬ 
countered on the earths surface. This, and their inborn hatred of 
discipline, prevent the resurgence of these creatures, for they have 
become numerous once again and acquired new powers. However, 
they have also become somewhat unstable, possibly as a result of 
inbreeding, and insanity is common among the species. 

If a kuo-toan lair is founds it contains 4dl0 x 10 2nd4evel 
males. In addition, there are higher level fighters in the same ra¬ 
tio as noted for wandering groups. The leader of the group is one 
of the following, depending on the lair's population: 

A priest /thief king of 12/24th level, if 350 or more normal kuo- 
toa are present, or 

A priest/thief prince of 11/13th level, if 275-349 normal kuo-toa 
are present, or 

A priest/thief duke of !0/12th level, if fewer Lhan 275 normal 
kuo-toa are present 

There are also the f ollowing additional kuo-toa in the lair; 

Eight Eyes of the priest leader—6th- to 8th-level priest/thieves 

One Chief Whip—6th/6th-level fighter/thief 

Two Whips of 4th/4th or 5th/5th level (see whip description! 

One Monitor per 20 2nd-level kuo-toa 

Females equal to 20% of Lhe male population 

Young (noncombatant) equal to 20% of the total kuo-toa 

Slaves equal to 50% of the total male population 

In special religious areas there are also a number of kuo-toan 
priests. For every 20 kuo-toa in the community there is a 3rd- 
level priest, for every 40 there is a 4th-levd priest, for every 80 
there is a Sthdevel priest, all in addition to the others. These 
priests are headed by one of the following groups: 

One 6th-level priest if the group is 160 or fewer, or One 7th-level 
and one 6th-levd priest if the group is between 161 and 
240, or 

OneBth-level, one 7th-level, and one 6th-level priest if the group 
numbers between 241 and 320, or 
One 9th-level two 7th-leveb and three 6th-level priests if the 
group numbers between 321 and 400, or 
One 10th-level ( two 8th-leve1, and four 6th-levd priests if the 
group numbers over 400 

Though kuo-toa prefer a diet of flesh, they also raise fields of 
kelp and fungi to supplement their food supply. These fields, lit 
by strange phosphorescent fungi, are tended by slaves, who are 
also used for food and sacrifices. 

Kuo-toan treasures tend more toward pearls, gem-encrusted 
items of a water motif, and mineral ores mined by their slaves. 
Any magical items in the possession of a kuo-toan are usually 
obtained from adventuring parties that never made it home 
again. 

Ecology: Not much is known to surface-dwelling sages about 
this enigmatic, violent, subterranean race, but some of the more 
astute scholars speculate that the kuo-toa are but one-third of the 
three-way rivalry that includes mind flayers and drow. It is parti¬ 
ally because of this continuing warfare that none of the three 
races has been able to achieve dominance of the surface world.

Of all the hazards that the desert presents, few can compare with 
the trad race of flesh-eating creatures known as lamias. These 
half-human, half-quadruped beast hybrids use deceit, speed, and 
spells to entrap the foolhardy adventurer who dares wander into 
their ruins. 

Their upper torsos* arms, and heads resemble those of beauti¬ 
ful human women, while their lower bodies are those of beasts, 
such as goats, deer, or Hons, with the appropriate coloration. 
This hybrid configuration makes lamias very fast and powerful. 
They are usually armed with daggers, which they use to carve up 
thdr prey for the feast. Lamias sometimes smell like perfume 
flowers, so as to attract unwary victims. They wear no clothing 
or jewelry. In communicating, they use the common tongue. 

Combat: A lamia is able to use the following spells once per 
day! charm person , mirror image, suggestion, and illusion (as a 
wand). For purposes of duration, effect, etc, assume that the la¬ 
mia casts its spells at 9thdevel spell ability. These spells are typi¬ 
cally used to lure persons to the lamia and then hold them there 
for the creature to devour at its leisure. 

The lamia s touch permanently drains 1 point of Wisdom from 
a victim, and when his Wisdom drops below 3. he willingly does 
whatever the lamia tells him do. These orders often involve hav¬ 
ing the victim attack his compatriots while it continues whittling 
down their ranks. If it has a chance to drain the Wisdom of more 
than one victim, it will certainly do so. It may even use its charm 
spell to supplement its control over party members. 

Among a lamia's favorite illusions to cast upon itself are the 
following: a lovely damsel in distress* a tough but beautiful fe¬ 
male ranger, or an elf maiden. At times, it simply may cast an 
illusion of a lost child in distress or a group of peasants being 
attacked by a large beast, w'hile hiding itself, awaiting the right 
moment to attack from the rear. 

Habitat Society: Lamias dwell in ruined cities or caves, places 
situated in desert or wasteland areas. These evil creatures are sol¬ 
itary beasts, sustaining themselves on the flesh of those who walk 



too dose to their territories. During lean times, they supplement 
their diet by stalking game animals. Lamias hardly ever venture 
more than 10 miles from their lairs. 

Ecology; Lamias are legendary monsters that prey upon trav¬ 
elers or guard hidden places or objects oi power. They are myste¬ 
rious creatures that seem devoted to the spreading of chaos and 
evil in their dwelling places. 

Lamia Noble 

These beings rule over the lamias and the wild, lonely areas they 
inhabit They differ from the normal lamias in that the lamia no¬ 
bles' lower bodies are those of giant serpents and their upper 
bodies can be either male or female. It is rumored that the normal 
female lamia is bom from the union of two nobles. 

The males wield short swords and have ld6 levels of wizard 
spells, plus the inherenl spells charm person, mirror image, sug¬ 
gestion, and illusion. The females are unarmed and only attack 
with magic: they are more experienced magically and have 2d4 
levels of wizard spells plus the usual inherent spells. 

Like normal lamia, lamia nobles have the Wisdom-draining 
touch, 

AH lamia nobles are able to assume human form. In this guise 
they attempt to penetrate human society and wreak evil. They 
speak all of the languages of humans and demihumans. When in 
human form, they are recognizable as lamias by humans and 
demihumans only if the characters are of 7th level or higher, wi th 
a 5% cumulative chance per level above 6th. Priests and paladins 
receive an additional 15% chance (i.e.. a IQth-levd priest has a 
35% chance). Lamia nobles are given to outbursts of senseless 
violence.

The lammasu, a winged leonine figure with a human head, aids 
and protects lawful good persons. They are generally kind and 
friendly to all good creatures, 

Lammasu resemble golden-brown lions with ihe wings of ea¬ 
gles and the heads of men with shaggy hair and beards. Their 
formidable appearance is softened by their regal, compassionate, 
and beneficent expressions. They communicate in their own 
tongue, in common, and through a limited form of telepathy. 

Combat; Since lammasu are concerned for the welfare and 
safety of good beings, they almost always enter combat if they 
see good creatures being threatened, in the way least likely to 
cause harm to the good beings. 

Lammasu are able to become invisible or dimension door at will. 
They radiate a protechott from evil 10 1 radius (-2 penalty to ail evil 
attacks, +2 bonus to saving throws against evil attacks), Addition¬ 
ally they are able to use priest spells up to 4th level, at 7th-level 
proficiency, lammasu can employ four lst-level spells, three 2nd- 
level Spells, two 3rd-level spells, and one 4th-level spell. They have 
cure serious wounds (4d8 + 2) and cure critical wounds (,6d8 +6), 
and 10% of lammasu can speak a hoi y word as well. 

If all else fails, lammasu can attack with their two razor-sharp 
front claws, inflicting ld6 points of damage each. If they choose 
to swoop down from the sky on a target, this damage is doubled. 

Habitat/Society; The lammasu have a very structured and law- 
ful society, reflecting their alignment. They are organized in 
prides, just like lions. They dwell in old, abandoned temples situ- 
aLed in warm regions. These temples have not lost their consecra¬ 
tion, and in some way the lammasu are the self-appointed 
resident guardians of these high and holy places. As a rule, only 
one pride of lammasu is ever found in a 25-rnile area; they spread 
themselves out so they can respond quickly to any evil outburst. 

Lammasu females fight as effectively as the males; for every' 
four lammasu encountered, one is a female. When found in their 
lair, there are young equal to 25% of the adult population. Fe¬ 
male lammasu have the heads of women, with long, hair. 

Once a month, the pride leaders gather together to consort 
about how the war on evil goes. This grouping is called the Whi- 
temoon, since it takes place on the first night of the full moon. 
There are usually 6d6 lammasu and 2d4 greater lammasu, with 
the latter presiding over the meeting* Such a gathering of lawful 



good causes the entire temple where they meet to glow in a pure 
light, until it breaks up at dawn. There is perhaps no safer place 
in all the world that night. 

Though they dwell in warm areas, they occasionally visit eve¬ 
ry dime. They speak their own tongue as well as common. At 
times they use a limited form of telepathy. 

Good-aligned strangers are always well received. Neutrah are 
watched carefully, but are treated politely unless the outsiders be¬ 
gin causing trouble. Evil beings are firmly asked to leave, and if 
they fail to do so, they arc attacked by the pride. In case of trou¬ 
ble, there ts a cumulative 10% chance per turn that a neighboring 
pride picks up a telepathic summons and come to help out the 
original pride. Lammasu harbor an especially strong dislike for 
lamias and manticores. Some foolish people confuse lammasu 
for manticores, which does little to improve the lammasu dispo¬ 
sition toward them. 

Ecology: Lammasu keep the wastelands from being completely 
overrun by evil creatures* Their aid to frontier settlements is be¬ 
yond measurable value. 

Greater Lammasu 

These creatures are slightly larger than a lesser lammasu and one or 
two may be found dwelling with a pride of six or more lesser lamma¬ 
su, Greater lammasu can travel the Astral and Ethereal Planes, be¬ 
come invisible, teleport without error and dimension door, all at 
will. They radiate protection from evil in a 20' radius M penalty to 
evil attacks and 44 bonus to saving throws! and have the curative 
powers of their lesser cousins, Their priest spells consist of five 1st- 
level, four2nd-level, three3rd-level J two 4th-level, and one 5th-level 
spell* Fifty percent of greater lammasu can speak a holy word as 
well. They cast spells as 12th-level priests. 

Greater lammasu have empathy, telepathic communication 
and speak their racial speech and the common tongue. Despite 
their greater stature, these lammasu are just as gentle and humble 
as their lesser brethren.

Habitat Society: These creatures are found only in the waters 
of swamps and marshes. Giant leeches range from 1 to 4 Hit Dice 
in size? various sized creatures usually are found in a group. 


Throat Leech 

This leech is about one inch long and resembles an inconspicuous 
twig. It is found m pools, lakes, and streams. 

Anyone drinking water containing a leech has a 10% chance of 
taking it into his mouth unless the water is carefully filtered (such 
as through a sheet of gauze) before drinking. The leech sucks 
blood at the rate of 1-3 points of damage per round, until it be¬ 
comes completely distended. After ten rounds of sucking, the 
leech is bloated and will not suck any more blood. 

Each round that the leech is in the victim's throat, there is a 
50% chance that the victim chokes, causing an additional 1 d4 
points of damage. A victim who chokes on three successive 
rounds dies on the third round. 

Apart from magical means that may suggest themselves, the 
only way to kill a throat leech in a victim's throat is to place a 
thin, heated metal object, such as a wire, into the bloated leech; 


Giant leeches are horrid, slug-like creatures that dwell in wet, 
slimy areas and suck the blood of warm-blooded creatures. 

These disgusting parasites range from 2 to 5 feet long. Their 
slimy skin is mottled brown and tan with an occasional shade of 
gray. Two antennae protrude from atop the head. 

Combat: Leeches wait in the mud and slime for prey. The initial 
attack attaches the sucker mouth of the giant leech. On the next 
round, and on each round thereafter it drains blood for 1 point 
of damage per Hit Die of the leech. There is only a 1% chance 
that the victim is aware of the attack if it occurs in the water. The 
leech has anesthetizing saliva, and its bite and blood drain are 
not usually felt until weakness (the loss of 50% of hit points) sets 
in and makes the victim aware that something is amiss. 

They can be killed by attack or by salt sprinkled on their 
bodies. There is a 50% chance that the bite of one of these crea¬ 
tures causes a disease that is fatal in ld4 +1 w r eeks unless cured. 


the hot metal causes the leech to burst and no further damage is 
inflicted on the victim. 

Leech swarm 

This is merely a massive swarm ol small leeches, found only in 
the water. They move In a cloud 10 feet in diameter Anyone 
caught in the swarm receives Id 10 points of damage per round 
from blood drain. Area-effect attacks that Inflict 10 or more 
points of damage will disperse the swarm.

Leprechauns are diminutive folk who are found in fair, green 
lands and enjoy frolicking, working magic, and causing harmless 
mischief. 

Rumored to be a cross between a species of half ling and a 
strong strain of pixie, leprechauns are about 2 feet talk They 
have pointed ears, and their noses also come to a tapered point 
About 50% of all male leprechauns have beards. Pointed shoes, 
brown or green breeches, green or gray coats, and either wide- 
brimmed or stocking caps are the preferred dress of the wee folk. 
Many leprechauns also enjoy smoking a pipe, usually a long¬ 
stemmed one* 

Combat: These fun-loving creatures of magical talent are by 
nature noncombative* They can become invisible at will, poly¬ 
morph nonliving objects, create illusions (with full audio and ol¬ 
factory effects), and use ventriloquism spells as often as they like. 
Their keen ears prevent them from ever being surprised. Being 
full of mischief, they often (75%) snatch valuable objects from 
adventurers, turn invisible and dash away. There is a 75% 
chance that the attempt is successful. If pursued closely, there is a 
25% chance per turn of pursuit that the leprechaun drops the 
stolen goods. The chase never leads to the leprechaun's lair. 

If caught or discovered in its lair (10% chance), the leprechaun 
attempts to mislead his captor into believing that he is giving 
over his treasure while he actually is duping the captor. It re¬ 
quires great care to actually obtain the leprechaun's treasure. 

Habitat Society: Leprechauns live in families of up to 20, 
though they call this unit a clan. They use first names and sur¬ 
names, and it is fairly certain that these names are a good indica¬ 
tor of which dan one is dealing with. A lair usually consists of a 
warm, dry cave with a hearth, rugs, and furniture* Strangely, 
word travels fast between clans of the same surname, and a clan 
that a group of adventurers runs into may already know the ad¬ 
venturers' names from another dan the party encountered sev¬ 
eral days prior. 

There is a rumor that a King of the Leprechauns exists, but 
there seems to be no official political hierarchy* There are no 
communities or villages of leprechauns. 

It is rare to see leprechaun offspring, but they do exist, bom 
with the full magical powers of an adult. For every 10 adults en¬ 
countered in a lair, one child wUl be found. 



Leprechauns enjoy eating the same sorts of foods that humans 
and demihumans eat, with a spedal fondness for wine. This 
weakness may be used to outwit them. 

Gold is the one treasure found in every leprechaun s hoard. If 
an intruder secures this treasure, a leprechaun will bargain and 
beg to get it back. As a last desperate measure, he will grant the 
intruder three wishes (very limited), but only if the intruder gives 
over the treasure first. When this is done, the leprechaun will irt- 
deed grant the three wishes. After all three wishes, the lepre¬ 
chaun will flatter the intruder and declare that the three wishes 
were so well-phrased that he will give a fourth wish. If the fourth 
wish is pronounced, the leprechaun will cackle with glee, the re¬ 
sults of all the wishes will be reversed, and the intruder plus his 
group will be teleported (no saving throw) to a random location 
2620 miles away. No member of that party will never be able to 
find that particular leprechaun again. 

Leprechauns are naturally distrustful toward humans and 
dwarves, since these races have greedy tendencies. They get 
along well with elves, gnomes, and halflings. 

A leprechaun will not sit idly by while a helpless creature is 
attacked, since they have a soft spot for weaker creatures* In gen¬ 
eral, if a leprechaun senses that a stranger means no harm, he can 
be quite civil, but he will not bring visitors to his lair* If the lepre¬ 
chaun finds someone hurt, he might take the victim to his lair, 
but only after making sure that the stranger is not followed and 
cannot see where he is being taken. 

Ecology: The best times and places to observe leprechauns are 
called borderlines. Dawn and dusk (which are neither all light 
nor dark), the shore (which is neither all earth nor all water), or 
the equinoxes and solstices (which are neither one season nor an¬ 
other), are the best times and places to see leprechauns and their 
ilk frolicking and celebrating.

The leucrotta is a creature of ugly appearance and temperament 
that haunts deserted places in search of prey. 

The average Leucrotta stands 7 feet tall at the shoulder and can 
reach a length of 9 feet in its mature form. The body of the leu¬ 
crotta resembles that of a stag, with a leonine tufted tail and clov¬ 
en hooves. Its head resembles that of a huge badger, but instead 
of teeth it has sharp, jagged bony ridges. Its body is tan, with the 
neck gradually darkening until it turns black at the head. The so- 
called teeth are sickly gray, and its eyes glow with a feral red 
light. The smell of animals, decomposing on a hot humid day 
follows the leucrotta, and its breath is especially bad. 

Combat: This monster is very sly and can imitate a range of 
noises and voices, the most common ones being a man, a wom¬ 
an. a child, or domestic animals in pain. It uses these noises in 
order to trick its prey into approaching within attack distance. It 
hunts humans, demihumans, humanoids, and even other animal 
predators, Leucrotta are intelligent and can speak their own lan¬ 
guage as well as the common tongue, 

Leucrotta attack by biting for 3d6 points of damage. It is ru¬ 
mored that their bony ridges and jaws are so powerful that they 
can even bite through metal. If a leucrotta scores a hit against 
someone with a shield or armor, the target must roll a saving 
throw vs. crushing blow for the shield. If the roll fails, then in 
addition to scoring the regular damage, the beast managed to al¬ 
so bite through the shield. Once the shield is gone, the armor 
must go through the same routine with subsequent successful 
bites. 

Once an opponent is rendered helpless, a leucrotta will leave 
its prize and attack any other intruders if the melee is still going 
on. It will give chase to an enemy, but will never pursue beyond 
sight of any prey it has managed to already capture. 

When a leucrotta retreats, it turns its back on its opponent and 
kicks with its hind legs, causing ld6 points of damage with each 
hoof. 

Note to trackers: It is almost impossible to identify leucrotta 
tracks, since they look exactly like a stag's. 

Habitat Society: This ugly creature haunts deserted and deso¬ 
late places because most other creatures cannot bear the sight of 



it. Its ugliness is legendary. Leucrotta lair in treacherous ravines 
and rocky spires, because they are as surefooted as a mountain 
goat. Caves, old abandoned towers, or a hollowed out deadfall 
are the preferred lairs for this disgusting beast. 

For every four leucrotta found in a lair, there is a 10% chance 
that an extra one, an immature leucrotta of half strength, is also 
present. Leucrotta are not a very family oriented species, as their 
nasty tempers extend sometimes to each other. The beasts range 
over a 20-mile area. 

Since the leucrotta is not a very social creature, all strangers 
are nothing more than sources of food. Sometimes, a powerful 
chaotic evil person may entrap a leucrotta and force it to serve as 
a guardian, but such beasts rebel at the first opportunity. 

Those brave enough to venture into a leucrotta lair must first 
roll a successful saving throw vs. poison wnth a -I penalty, due to 
the horrendous stench, or gag helplessly for ld4 rounds. Once 
inside, the money and possessions of past victims await. 

Though the leucrotta prefer freshly killed meat, they are not 
above eating carrion. This serves to enhance their already bad 
reputation. 

Ecology: Leucrotta distance themselves from the grand picture 
of nature, preferring to lurk on the fringes. They serve no practi¬ 
cal use and one would be hard pressed to find a druid that would 
try to protect a member of this species. Some sages speculate that 
the leucrotta is an unnatural abnormality, an aberration spawned 
by some demented power or archmage. 

Still some mages prize the leucrotta hide for creating boots of 
striding and springing* hoping that the surefootedness of the 
beast passes down to the boots themselves. There are rumors that 
leucrotta saliva is an effective antidote to love philters, but so far 
there have been no volunteers to test this theory.

Hie lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful form of undead known 
to exist. They seek to further their own power at all costs and have 
little or no interest in the affairs of the living, except where those af¬ 
fairs interfere with their own, 

A lich greatly resembles a wight or mummy, being gaunt and skele¬ 
tal in form The creature's eye sockets are black and empty save for 
the fierce pinpoints of light which serve the lich as eyes. The lich can 
see with normal vision in even the darkest of environments but Is 
unaffected by even the brightest light. An aura of cold and darkness 
radiates from the lich which makes it an ominous and fearsome sight. 
They were originally wizards of at least 18th level. 

Lichee are often (75%) garbed in the rich clothes of nobility, if not 
so attired, the lich will be found in the robes of its former profession. 
In either case, the clothes will be tattered and rotting with a 25% 
chance of being magical in some way. 

Combat; Although a lich will seldom engage in actual melee com¬ 
bat with those it considers enemies, it is more than capable of holding 
its own when forced into battle. 

The aura of magical power which surrounds a lich is so potent that 
any creature of fewer than 5 Hit Dice (or 5th level) which sees it must 
save vs. spell or flee in terror tor 5-20 I5d4) rounds. 

Should the lich elect to touch a living creature, its aura of absolute 
cold will inflict 1-10 points of damage. Further the victim must save 
vs. paralysis or be utterly unable to move, This paralysis lasts until 
dispelled in some manner. 

Liches can themselves be hit only by weapons of at least +1, by 
magical spells, or by monsters with 6 or more Hit Dice and/or magi¬ 
cal properties. The magical nature ol the Hch and its undead state 
make it utterly immune to charm sleep, enfeehlement, polymorph, 
cold . electricity, insanity, or deaffo spelts. Priests of at least 8th level 
can attempt to turn a lich, as can paladins of no less than IQlh level, 

A lich is able to employ spells just as it did in life. It still requires 
the use of Its spell books, magical components, and similar objects. It 
is important to note that most, if not all liches have had a great deal 
of time in which to research and create new magical spells and ob¬ 
jects, Thus, adventurers should be prepared to face magic the likes of 
which they have never seen before when stalking a lich. In addition, 
liches are able to use any magical objects which they might possess 
Just as if they were still alive. 



Defeating a lich in combat is difficult indeed, but managing to ac¬ 
tually destroy the creature is harder still , in all cases, a lich will pro¬ 
tect itself from annihilation with the creation of a phylactery in 
which it stores its life force. This is similar to a tnugtC jar spell. In 
order to ensure the final destruction of a lich, its body must be wholly 
annihilated and its phylactery must be sought out and destroyed in 
some manner. Since the lich will always take great care to see to it 
that its phylactery is well hidden and protected this can be an under¬ 
taking fully as daunting as the defeat of the lich in its physical form. 

Habitat/Society: Liches are usually solitary creatures. They have 
cast aside their places as living beings by choice and now want as 
little to do with the world of men as possible. From time to time, 
however a lichs interest in the world at large may be reawakened by 
some great event of personal importance, 

A lich will make its home in some ominous fortified area, often a 
strong keep or vast subterranean crypt. 

When a Lich does decide to become involved with the world be¬ 
yond its lair, its keen intelligence makes it a dangerous adversary. In 
some cases, a lich will depend on its magical powers to accomplish its 
goals, if this is not sufficient, however, the lich is quite capable of 
animating a force of undead troops to act on its behalf. If such is the 
case, the lich s endless patience and cunning more than make up for 
the inherent disadvantages of the lesser forms of undead which it 
commands. 

Although the lich has no interest in good or evil as we understand 
it. the creature will do whatever it must to further its own causes. 
Since it feels that the living are of little importance, the lich is often 
viewed as evil by those who encounter it. In rare cases, liches of a 
most unusual nature can be found which are of any alignment. 

The lich can exist for centuries without change. Its will drives it 
onw ard to master new magics and harness mystical powers not avail¬ 
able to it in its previous life. So obsessed does the monster become 
with its quest for power that it often forgets its former existence utter¬ 
ly. Few liches call themselves by their old names when the years have 
drained the last vestiges of their humanity from them. Instead, they 
often adopt pseudonyms like The Black Hand' or the Forgotten 


222 






Lich 


King." Learning the true name at a lich is rumored to confer power 
over the creature. 

Ecology: The lich is not a thing of this world. Although it was once a 
living creature, it has entered into an unnatural existence. 

In order to became a lich, the wizard must prepare its phylactery 
by the use of the enchant an item . magic jar, permanency and reincar¬ 
nation spells The phylactery which can be almost any manner of 
object, must be of the finest craftsmanship and materials with a value 
of not less than 1,500 gold pieces per level of the wizard. Once this 
object is created, the would-be lich must craft a potion of extreme 
toxicity, which is then enchanted with the following spells: 
wraithferm, permanency, cone of cold , feign death, and animate 
dead. When next the moon is full, the potion is imbibed. Rather than 
death, the potion causes the wizard to undergo a transformation into 
Its new state. A system shock survival throw is required, w ith failure 
indicating an error in the creation of the potion which kills the wizard 
and renders him forever dead, 

Dmdtidi 

The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the lich. 
Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve as the 
power ivhich has sustained its physical form gradually begins to fail. 
In most cases, all that remains of a demilich's body are a skull, some 
bones, and a pile of dust. 

When il has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the lich 
will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to even 
the wisest of sages. Since il has no use for its physical body at this 
point, the lich leaves il to decay as it should have done centuries ago. 

If ihe final resting place of a demilich s remains are entered, the 
dust which was once its body will rise up and assume a man-like 
shape. In the case of the oldest demiliches {25%}, the shape will ad¬ 
vance and threaten, but dissipate without attacking in 3 rounds un¬ 
less attacked. Younger demiliche* 175%) still retain a link to their 
remains, however, and will form with the powers of a wraith. This 
dust form cannot be turned, In addition, it can store energy from 
attacks and use this power to engage its toes. If the dust form is at¬ 
tacked. each point of damage which is delivered to it is converted to 
an energy point. Since the demilich will fall back and seem to suffer 
injury from each attack (though none is actually inflicted), its attack¬ 
ers are likely to press on in their attempts to destroy it. Once the de¬ 
milich has acquired 50 energy points, it will assume a manifestation 
which looks much like the lichs earlier undead form and has the 
powers and abilities of a ghost, but which cannot be turned. 

If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to face 
the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen over a 
non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as a death 
ray, affecting all creatures within a 2(T radius of the skull. Those who 
fail to save vs. death are permanently dead. 

On (he next round, the demilich will employ another manner of 
attack. In order to attain the status of a detnilich, a lich must have 
replaced 5-5 i ld4 + 4) of its teeth with gems, Each of these gems now 
serves as a powerful magical device which can tmp the soul of its 
adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the demilichs 
spell collapses and rots away in a single round. Once it has drained 
the life essence from the most powerf ul member of the party the skull 
sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be challenged, the demilich 
can repeal this attack until all of its gems are filled. An amulet of life 
protection will prevail over the gem, but the character s body will 
perish regardless. 

In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also 
pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be so 
mighty as to include: always being hit by one s enemies, never mak¬ 
ing a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience points. 


Demilich curses can be overcome with a remove curse, but the victim 
loses one point of charisma permanently when the curse js removed. 

The skull of a demilich is Armor Gass ^6 and has 50 hit points. It cars 
be affected by spells in only a few ways: a forget spell will cause it to sink 
down without attacking (either by hoivling or draining a soulf a dispel 
evil will do 5-S (ld4 + 4) points of damage to it, a shatter spell will inflict 
5T6 (3d6) points of damage to it, a holy word pronounced against ir will 
deliver 5-30 (5db) points of damage, and a power word kill spell cast by 
an ethereal or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it). 

Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich, but 
there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a vorpal sword, sword 
of sharpness, sword +5, or vorpal weapon can inflict normal dam¬ 
age on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4 weapon. Fur¬ 
ther, any character with a +4 or better weapon or a mace of 
disruption can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each time he 
strikes it. 

Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped 
inside the gems must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail 
are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich to power its 
magical nature, If the character survives, the gem glows with a faint 
inner light, and true seeing will reveal a tiny figure trapped within. If 
the throw is made the soul can be freed by simply crushing the gem. 
A new body must be within 10 yards for the soul to enter or It will be 
lost. Such a body might be a clone or simulacrum. (See spells ol those 
names.) 

If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by immer¬ 
sion in holy water and the casting of a magic the demilich will 

reform in 1-10 days. 

Arch lich 

From time to time, sages have heard rumors of liches having alignments 
other than evil, and even lawful good liches apparently have existed. 
There have even been reports of priests who, in extreme circumstances, 
have become liches. These reports have recently been verified, but the 
archlich is as rare as Rocs teeth.

Living walls appear to be normal walls of stone or brick, al¬ 
though they radiate both evil and magic if detected. Infravision 
will not detect any peculiar patterns. However, a character who 
casts a true seeing spell or who peers through a gem of seeing will 
see past the illusion: the wall actually consists of greying and sin¬ 
ewy flesh—of faces, hands, broken bones, feet, and toes jutting 
from the surface. Characters within 5 yards of the wall can hear 
low moans of horror, pain, and sorrow issuing from it. Even if a 
silence spell is cast, the moans still rise. 

A living wall contains the melded bodies of humanoids and 
monsters who died within 100 yards of the wall since its cr Aion. 
Those who die lighting a Living wall are absorbed into it ur ac¬ 
tually strengthen it. Characters and monsters capture*! tv the 
wall retain all the abilities they had in life: as p* r f the v.a&gt;\ 
they become chaotic evil and fight any creature erut approaches 
it to the best of their abilities. 

It a wizard becomes melded with a living wall, his spellcasting 
abilities are retained and can immediately be used for attacks. 
The wizard retains any spells that were memorized at the time he 
was absorbed into the wall: these are renewed each day. If a war¬ 
rior loses his life in combat with a living wall, his fighting abilities 
and his weapons come under control of the beast: the weapons 
are hidden within the wall until the wall attacks, then are pushed 
through the mass of graying flesh to the surface. A hand attaches 
itsell to the weapon, and eyes jutting from the wall guide the at¬ 
tack of the weapon. If the wall absorbs characters with ranged 
weapons, the weapons become useless once arrows, quarrels, or 
other necessary projectiles are expended. 

Combat: A living wall never initiates combat, except against its 
creator, whom it despises. When such a w r all is attacked, every 
creature lhaL is part of the wall returns one attack, per strike 
against the wall. If a wall is made up of 12 creatures and one 
creature lands a blow on the wall, the attacker is subject to a 
dozen return blows from the wall. 

All creatures in the wall fight according to their normal attack 
modes, These attacks can be magical, physical, or mental in ori¬ 
gin. The type of attack and its damage often depend upon who or 
what is melded into the wall. 

If a 10th-level fighter and a 6th-Ievd fighter are absorbed into 
the wall, the wall attacks as one 6th-levd fighter and one 10th- 


level fighter. For every mage or priest absorbed, the wall gains 
spell attacks. The only spells that can be used, however, are those 
that the mage or priest had memorized (and had material compo¬ 
nents for) at the time of absorption. Each of these spells may be 
cast once per day. The material components of the spells are not 
consumed. If one absorbed mage has three fireball spells memo¬ 
rized and a second mage has one fireball in memory, the living 
wall can attack with four fireballs per day, If the wall assimilates 
a paladin or a lawful good priest, ail his special powers are re¬ 
versed (e.g., detect good rather than detect evil, harm by laying 
of hands rather than heal r etc*)* 

Magical items absorbed with characters grant the wall their 
spell effects, though items that grant AC improvements are less 
effective because of the wall's size. The wall gains 1 point im¬ 
provement in Armor Class for every 3 points of magical im¬ 
provement to AC. Thus, a ring of protection +3 lowers the 
wall's AC by I, 

When a character is absorbed, his hit points, at full health, are 
added to the wall's base hit point total of 64. 

Nonmagical armor, packs, and purses are lost by absorbed 
characters. The piles of loot at the base of the wall often attracts 
bystanders, bringing them close enough to be seized by one of the 
wall's hands. 

Though a living wall will not initiate an attack, characters who 
come within, 2 feet of the wall may be weakly grabbed by its 
many beseeching hands, tugging at them and imploring them for 
deliverance. (Any character, regardless of Strength, may break 
the hold, ). Sometimes PCs who hear voices imploring, ' Help me! 
pull me free, help me!" grope about until they grab a hand. In this 
case, the character must roll a save vs. spell or become absorbed. 
If another character is holding onto the first character, he must 
also roll a saving throw vs, spell or become absorbed into the 
wall If the save vs. spell succeeds, the character is able to break 
free. A character who views the absorption of any creature into 
l he wail must make a horror check. 

Once absorbed, characters are lost forever. A wish spell, 
worded carefully, can remove one or more trapped characters, 

Pas$watl spells do not allow individuals to go through a living 
wall. Characters must either cut through or blast through using 
magic. This, however, allows the wall to return attacks. When 
cutting or blasting though the living wall the stench that rises 
from the exposed underflesh is nauseating and horrifying. A sav¬ 
ing throw vs. poison is required to avoid passing out from the 
smell. A successful saving throw indicates the character is only 
nauseated, 

Living walls are immune to all planar and temporal spells- 
.Speak with dead, ESP and similar spells reveal a cacophony of 
tortured minds and voices. The caster learns nothing and must 
make a horror check* 

Habitat Society: Living walls never reproduce and always re¬ 
main active until they are killed. Living walls encountered in the 
lairs of malevolent creatures often serve as part of a torture 
chamber, or to cover the true openings to secret passageways or 
corridors. 

No one knows whether these monstrosities are limited in size 
or longevity. Walls as large as 15 feet high, 30 feet long, and 10 
feet thick have been reported. Living walls do&gt; however, seem to 
be limited to one section of wall. Thus, a cemetery or castle could 
not be surrounded by one large living wall. 

Nor can a wall section spread beyond Itself: a house with a 
living wall in its basement will not slowly become a living house* 


224 





Living Wall 


The wall desires, above all else, to slay the creature who cre¬ 
ated it. If it does so, or the creature meets its end within 100 yards 
of the wall, the corpse of the hated creator is assimilated and the 
beings trapped in the wall are freed to return to the peace of 
death. The wall reverts to being a structure of stone, with the 
corpse of its creator entombed within. 

Ecology: Chaotic evil mages occasionally create these monoliths. 
The exact method is unknown, but several years of preparation 
and spelleasling are required. A minimum of three corpses are 
necessary for the spells. 

A fact known only to one or two inhabitants of Ravenloft, is 
that living walls also arise as rare manifestations of Ravenloffs 
power, as responses to despair and dread. These walls are bom in 
curses, midwived by death, and nursed on massacre. 

The seed for such a living wall is planted when one sapient 
creature willfully entombs another in a wall. The hapless victim 
may be bound and walled alive in a rock niche on a windswept 
mountain trail, a sill in a fetid catacomb, a corner in an asylum, a 
cave wall a mausoleum facade, or any other stone or brick walk 
Once entombed, the victim will suffocate, dehydrate, or starve in 
utter darkness and solitude. But even this agony is not sufficient 


to wake the land's attention—the entombed creature, in his ter¬ 
ror, must curse his slayer, screaming loudly enough for his voice 
to carry beyond his tomb of stone. Only then does the land hear 
his agony. 

When the victim dies, his life force is trapped within the wall. 
As he struggles to escape, his life energy becomes soiled by the 
soot of his screams and curses, which thickly coat the inside of 
his stone sarcophagus. In a matter of days, madness corrupts the 
trapped life force, changing it to chaotic evil. 

At this point, the bodies of any creatures that have died within 
100 yards of the wall within the last month rise, shamble to the 
wall, and meld into it. Even corpses that have been buried will 
dig their way to the surface and converge upon the wall. Al¬ 
though the wall retains its previous appearance, it is no longer 
stone, but a gray and rotting bulwark of limbs, ribs, hands* 
bones, and faces, twisted and fused together Bodies of any sub¬ 
sequent deaths occurring within 100 yards also rise and wander 
to the wall for assimilation. 

Most cultures, and all good-aligned characters, attempt to de¬ 
stroy these creations wherever they are found. But many of these 
assaults merely strengthen the wall with deposits of more 
corpses.

Fire Lizards 

Fire lizards resemble wingless red dragons and are sometimes called "false 
dragons.' They are gray-colored with mottled red and brown back and red¬ 
dish undereidts, Hatchlings are light gray in color and darken as they age. 

Combat: Fire lizards attack with a combination of raking claws and 
bite. They can simultaneously breathe a fiery cone 5 feet wide at the 
mouth, 10 feet wide at the end, and 15 feet long which inflicts 1-12 points 
of fire-based damage "half if saving throw vs, breath weapon Is made). 
Fire lizards are immune to fire-based attacks. 

Habitat Society: Fire lizards prefer subterranean lairs but come out eve¬ 
ry fortnight to hunt fresh game. Prey is hauled back to the lair for a lei¬ 
surely meal; the debris forms the treasure trove. Fire lizards are slow 
moving and sleep 50% of the time. Their lairs may have 1-4 eggs (10% 
chance, market value 5,000 gp eachi Hatchlings immediately leave to 
hunt on their own. Shiny objects attract fire lizards: gems and metals 
form the bulk of treasure found in their dens. 

Ecology: Fire lizards are perhaps an ancestral dragon type or offshoot 
of a common ancestor Real dragons avoid these 'False dragons," which 
live to be 50-100 years old. Fire lizard eggs are worth 5,000 gp, hatchlings 
7300 gp. 

Giant Lizards 

This lizard is relatively normal, albeit targe, and lives in marshes and 
swamps. An attack score of 20 means the giant lizard s victim is trapped 
in the mouth and suffers double damage (2-16 points}. The giant lizard 
inflicts 2-16 points of damage each round thereafter. Giant lizards are la¬ 
zy hunters and tend to attack anything edible that wanders by. While 
their great size protects them from most predators, it renders them a 
sumptuous feast to the black dragons who share their swamps. Giant liz¬ 
ards are sometimes domesticated by lizard men, who use them as 
mounts, beasts of burden, and food. Their lairs may be home to a wide 
range of lizards, from eggs to century-old adults. 

Minotaur Lizards 

This huge, aggressive lizard derives its name from its horns. While these 
horns look like those of a minotaur, the males horns are not used in 
combat—rather, they are believed to be a means of attracting a mate. The 
rmnotaur lizard attacks with sharp daws and teeth. They are adept at am¬ 
bushes; others are -5 on their surprise rail. An attack roll of 20 means the 
lizard has trapped its victim within its jaws andean automatically inflict 3-18 
points of damage each round thereafter until the victim escapes or dies. The 
victim is unable to attack the following round Minotaur lizards are found in 
tropical hilts and mountains near copper and red dragons.

Subterranean Lizards 

This aggressive lizard is able to run across walls or ceilings with the help 
of its suction cup-tipped feet An attack roll of 20 means the lizard has 
damped its jaws on its victim and does double damage E4-24 points). The 
victim automatically suffers an additional 2-12 points of damage each 
round thereafter. These lizards never leave their caves voluntarily. Some 
species are albino; these shun light and attack at -1 in daylight or its 
equivalent. Other species have tongues up to 20 feet long, Any man-sized 
or smaller prey seized by the tongue will be drawn into the mouth and 
bitten the next round unless a bertd bars roll is made.

Lizard men are savage, semi-aquatic, reptilian humanoids that 
jive through scavenging, raiding, and, in less hostile areas, by 
fishing and gathering. 

Adult lizard men stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weighing 200 to 250 
pounds. Skin tones range from dark green to gray to brown, and 
their scales give them a flecked appearance. Their tails average 3 
to 4 feet long and are not prehensile. Males are nearly impossible 
to distinguish from females without close Inspection, Lizard man 
garb is limited to strings of bones and other barbaric ornament. 
Lizard men speak their own language. 

Combat: In combat, lizard men fight as unorganized individ¬ 
uals. If they have equality or an advantage over their opponents, 
they tend toward frontal assaults and massed rushes. When out¬ 
numbered, overmatched, or on their home ground, however, 
they become wily and ferocious opponents. Snares, sudden am¬ 
bushes, and spoiling raids are favored tactics in these situations. 
While individually savage in melee, lizard men tend to be dis¬ 
tracted bv food (such a&amp; slain opponents) and by simple trea¬ 
sures which may allow some of their quarry to escape. They 
occasionally take prisoners as slaves, for food, or to sacrifice in 
obscure tribal rites. 

For every 10 lizard men encountered , there will be one patrol lead¬ 
er with maximum hit points f 17 hp) and a 50% chance for a shaman 
with 3 Hit Dice and the abilities of a 3rd-Ievel priest. If one or more 
tribes are encountered, each tribe will also have a war leader oi 6 Hit 
Dice, two subleaders with 4 Hit Dice, and a shaman of either 4 or 5 
Hit Dice (50% chance of each). Any group of two or more tribes has 
a 50% chance for an additional shaman of 7 Hit Dice, Furthermore, 
each such group has a cumulative 10% chance per tribe to be led by 
a lizard king. If a lizard king is present, a shaman of 7 Hit Dice will 
always be present, and all patrol leaders from each tribe (i.e, r 10% 
of the male warriors) will be combined into a single fanatical body¬ 
guard for the lizard king. 


227 


Habilat/Sariety: Lizard men are typically found in swamps, 
marshes, and similar places, often (35%) dwelling totally under¬ 
water in air-filled caves. A tribe rarely numbers more than 150 
individuals, including females and hatchlings. It is not uncom¬ 
mon for several tribes in an area to forge an informal alliance 
against outsiders, including other lizard man tribes. 

Lizard men are omnivorous, but are likely to prefer human 
flesh to other foods, In this regard they have been known to am¬ 
bush humans, gather up the corpses and capture the survivors, 
and take the lot back to their lair for a rude and horrid feast. 

Ecology: Lizard men have few natural enemies. They prey on 
human, demihuman, or humanoid settlements if these are near¬ 
by, Lizard man eggs are bitter and inedible, as is their flesh, but 
their skin is sometimes worked as scale armor (Armor Gass 6). 
Lizard men produce no art, artifacts, or trade goods. 

Advanced Lizard Men 

About 1 tribe in 10 has evolved to a higher state. These lizard 
men dwell in crude huts, use shields (thus Armor Class 4) and 
hurl barbed darts (30 yard range, i-4 points damage) or javelins 
(1-6 points damage) before closing with the enemy. These lizard 
men use clubs (treat as morning stars, 2-6 points damage), and 
the leaders may use captured swords or other weaponry. The 
chance of these advanced lizard men having a lizard king is dou¬ 
bled, Le, r 20% cumulative chance per tribe. 

Lizard King 

A lizard king is a lizard man of above average height and Intelli¬ 
gence, leading one or more loosely organized tribes of lizard men. 
The lizard king is most often armed with a great trident, w r hich it 
wields with great skill and ferocity. In the hands of the lizard king, 
the weapon inflicts 5-20 (3d6 + 2) points of damage, If the attack roll 
is 5 or more greater than the score needed to hit, the lizard king in¬ 
flicts double damage (with a minimum of 15 points), 

A lizard king usually demands two humans each week. If no 
humans are available, demihumans and other humanoids will be 
sought. If none are available, two of the lizard king's bodyguards 
will be killed and eaten instead.

The locathah are a humanoid race of aquatic nomads that roams 

warm coastal waters. 


A typical locathah stands 5 to 6 leet tall and weighs 150 to 200 
pounds. The skirt is covered in fine but tough scales. The scales 
vary in color from a ivory yellow on the stomach and neck to a 

pale yellow on the rest of the body. The fins of their ears and 
spine are ocher. The ear fins enhance hearing while the large eyes 
are designed to enhance underwater vision. The only way to dis¬ 
tinguish males from females is a vertical ocher stripe marking the 
egg sac. On the surface, locathah have a typically fish-like smell. 
They speak their own language; 10% also speak merman, koalin- 

th, or other aquatic languages. 


Combat: The intelligent locathah have developed tactics that 
enable them to beat their deadlier rivals. They always operate in 
teams, the larger the better. Furthermore, when away from their 
homes they ride giant eels that act as both mounts and allies. 

A typical locathah force is armed as follows; 

Lance 

20% 

Crossbow 

30% 

Trident 

30% 

Short sword 

20% 


Since a locathah lacks claws or teeth, it cannot do damage if it is 
disarmed. If that happens, it will either grapple a foe (if armed 
locathah are present), look for weapons, or flee, locathah only 
battle to the death if cornered or if their home is threatened, 

Habitat Society: Locathah have developed a society similar to 
that of surface humans* They have a well-developed hunter- 
gatherer society and a strong sense of territory, Locathah make 
their lairs in rocks carved into castle-like strongholds. These 
aquatic castles are very similar to their surface counterparts. 
Openings are protected by stout doors, shutters, or coral bars. 
Often 4d4 moray eels are used as guardbeasts. There is a 50% 
chance that Portuguese man-o-war jellyfish may be used as traps. 
A herd of giant eels is kept at the edge of each stronghold. 

Locathah have a communal society organized in tribes of 20 to 
several hundred. Each band of forty locathah has a leader (18 hit 
points, treat as a 4th-level fighteri and four assistants (14 hit 



points, treat as 3rd-level fighters). Clans of more than 120 loca¬ 
thah are led by a female chieftain (22 hit points, treat as a 5th- 
level fighter) accompanied by 12 guards (12-14 hit points, treat as 
3rd-level fighters). 

Clan chieftains are prolific egg layers. Eggs are gathered into 
well-guarded nurseries where they hatch after five to six months. 
Hatchlings are raised communally but each is assigned a "par¬ 
ent, a nonwarrior adult that takes personal responsibility for 
that hatchling. 

Locathah shamans are priests of up to the 3rd level. 

Ecology: Locathah are omnivorous. They have both aquatic 
farmers and hunter-gatherers that provide a varied diet for their 
clan brethren. The locathahs stone-age technology is limited to 
manufacturing weapons, tools, and ornaments from available 
materials. More advanced or magical items are scavenged from 
sunken wrecks, invaders, and drowning victims. Although they 
defend their territories against hostile invaders, locathah cooper¬ 
ate with nonhostile visitors, especially traders. Locathan coral 
carvings and jewelry are highly valued by art collectors and are 
traded for forged metals, ceramics, and durable magical items. 
Locathah can be hired to assist travelers in their realm. They also 
collect tolls from fishermen using locathah territorial waters, 

Locathah never voluntarily leave the water. They are almost 
helpless on land. They are limited to slow crawls because they 
are unused to supporting their own weight. The use of magic to 
fly or levitate will negate this helplessness. They risk swift suffo¬ 
cation as their gills dry out; after ten turns, a surfaced locathah 
suffers 1 point of damage each round. If the locathah immerses 
itself in water, the damage is halted. 

Locathah always try to recover captive locathah or their 
bodies. If such are detected aboard a ship, other locathah might 
first demand the return of their kin or simply sink the boat by 
carving into its bottom.

The lurker is a carnivorous scavenger found only in subterranean 
settings, It resembles a large manta ray; its grayish belly is tex¬ 
tured like stone. The lurker typically attaches itself to a ceiling, 
where it is very difficult to detect (only 10% chance) unless actu¬ 
ally prodded. 

Combat; Lurkers are slow-moving creatures that must wait for 
their prey to come into range. Lurkers wait on the ceiling, then 
drop and wrap themselves around their prey. Lurkers cause a -4 
penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. The constriction causes ld6 
points of damage per round and suffocation within Id4 + 1 
rounds, regardless of the damage suffered by the victim. This 
damage is automatic each round unless the victim breaks free or 
the lurker dies. Lurker* do not stop attacking until dead. Prey 
can only fight with short weapons that were in hand when the 
lurker attacked, 

Habitat.Society: Lurkers are solitary creatures. The females 
lays eggs in a glutinous dutch near the ceiling. The hatchlings fall 
to the ground and feed on vermin untit they become large enough 
to fly. Young resemble rectangular patches of moss. 

Ecology; Lurkers are opportunistic feeders that make do with 
whatever wanders bv. The lurker flies by means of gases gener¬ 
ated into sacs. These gases may be used in the preparation of a 
potion of levitation. Lurker eggs or hatchlings may be sold as 
living defenses for those who want them. Lurker, trapper, and 
miner eggs can all be sold for 900 gp. hatchlings for 1,100 gp. 

Trapper 

The subterranean trapper is found only in caves and other dark 
places. It can alter its shape and color to resemble the local floor 
and to form a protuberance in the center that resembles a box, A 
trapper is difficult to detect (95%) once it has settled into a dis¬ 
guise. When prey wanders into the trapper's center, the creature s 
edges rise up and wrap around the victim. The victim suffers 
damage per round equal to 4 points plus his Armor Class (a vie* 
tim with AC 2 suffers 6 points of damage per round). The con¬ 
striction prevents breathing; victims smother in six rounds 
regardless of the damage suffered. A trapper does not release a 
victim unless the trapper is reduced to 1 hit point or killed. 

Trappers are immune to heat- or cold-based attacks. Trappers 
remain wrapped in a ball for IdS hours while digesting a victim. 
The remains of their victims are excreted below and form the 


trappers treasure troves. A typical trapper can cover about 400 
square feet, while large ones can cover up to 600 square feet. 

Eggs are laid in a pebble-like mass. Hatchlings resemble flat 
rocks. Trapper skin may be used to make nonmagical +1 leather 
armor. 

Forest Trapper (Miner) 

The forest trapper, or miner, resembles a tailless manta ray mot¬ 
tled brown or green-brown. Its frontal and dorsal ridges are hard 
bone. 

It preys primarily on small forest animals but traps larger crea¬ 
tures by burrowing beneath paths or roads, then extending the 
ld20+5 poisonous, twig-like barbs on its back through the surface. 
Passers-by have a 25% chance (75% if surprised) of unknowingly 
stepping on one. If not surprised, druids or rangers have a S% 
chance per level of spotting and identifying the barbs. Victims must 
roll successful saving throws vs. poison or be paralyzed for 2d20 
turns. A miner wiU not surface until all surface movement stops. 
Then it attacks in the same manner as a subterranean trapper, 
Miners travel slowly on the surface by rippling like a snake. 
Burrowing is faster but travel is limited to soil, sand, and gravel. 
Because a miner is always underground unless attacking, it is 
rarely attacked. The miner's toxin is located in sacs at the base of 
the barbs. The toxic barbs can be used in a blowgun or as a hand 
weapon by small creatures, provided the grip is wrapped. 

Eggs are laid in a clutch several feet below the surface. The 
young feed on burrowing animals for their first year.

Lycanthrope, General 


Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves to re¬ 
semble normal animals or monsters. The term ‘lycanthrope'' is 
actually a misnomer, coming from the roots lycos (wolf), and at i- 
thropos (manl A more correct term is "therianthrope,' from f/ie- 
rios (animal I and autfiropos, However. since werewolves are the 
most common therianthropes, the term lycanthrope has gained 
much more popularity and more common usage. 

To further confuse the issue, there are creatures like the 
wolfwere and jackalwere, animals which can assume human 
form. These creatures Cantherions" for lack of a better term) 
pass on their condition genetically (that is. by having offspring), 
not by biting and infecting other creatures. Other differences be¬ 
tween the tivo classes of creature include their vulnerabilities: an- 
therions can be struck by cold iron, lycanthropes by silver, 
Antherions hate lycanthropes, and always attack their counter¬ 
parts (wolfweres attack werewolves, etc.), likewise, most lycan¬ 
thropes feel enmity for antherions, and attack on sight as well. 

In addition, there are many subspecies of some lycanthropes, 
beyond the differences in animal type. For instance, there are 
three distinct subspecies of werewolf, differing in their secondary 
form: one has fangs, a furred body a tail, wolf-like legs, and lu¬ 
pine features (but without the snout); another has a very wolf- 
hke face and body with human hands, and is easily mistaken for 
a wolf when down on all fours; and the third secondary form is 
that of a huge wolf, as big as a bear. 

The condition of being a lycanthrope, often referred to as a 
curse, is called lycanthropy. A distinction must be made between 
true lycanthropes and infected lycanthropes. True lycanthropes 
are those to whom lycanthropy is a genetic trait: they breed with 
other lycanthropes and produce baby lycanthropes. Only true 
lycanthropes can infect others with lycanthropy. Infected lycan¬ 
thropes are those w-hose lycanthropy results from being wound¬ 
ed by a true lycanthrope. 

There are also creatures known by some as induced lycan¬ 
thropes.' whose shape changes are effected by magical items; 
these creatures cannot infect others with lycanthropy though the 
magical items can be transferred to new owners. Some of the 
items are cursed, so that once they are worn, they cannot be re¬ 
moved without the application of a remove curse spell Induced 
lycanthropes include swanmays and anyone using a c/onk of the 
manta ray. 

Finally, there are ‘cursed lycanthropes" created by a certain 
spell curse of lycanthropy (see boxed text). 

True lycanthropes and induced lycanthropes seldom hate their 
"curse" They see themselves as being like any other creature, 
with the same right to survival Those bitten and infected, or 
those affected by the curse of lycanthropy spell are generally un¬ 
happy with their fate. These unfortunates seek cures and occa¬ 
sionally try to hunt down the lycanthrope who infected them (or 
the wizard who cursed them). 

Description: Most lycanthropes have three forms; some have on¬ 
ly two. See the individual descriptions for more details. The first 
form is always the natural humanoid form, which over time be¬ 
comes more and more reminiscent of the lycanthropes animal 
form. The second form is a hybrid, combining both animal and 
humanoid features; the size of this hybrid tends to lie between the 
humanoid size and the size of the creature replicated. The third 
form of the lycanthrope is externally identical to that of a normal 
creature of the replicated species: the only visual clue is that the 
eyes may glow in the dark, A slain lycanthrope always reverts to 
its natural humanoid form within one round of being killed. 


Curse of Lycanthropy (Necromancy Alteration) 

6th-levd Wizard spell 

Range: Touch Casting Time: 6 

Components: V, S r M Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Duration: Special Saving Throw: Negates 

This spell causes a temporary case of lycanthropy in the victim 
touched by the caster. A normal attack roll is required for the wiz¬ 
ard to touch the victim, who must then roll a saving throw vs. 
spell Failure indicates that the victim is affected by lycanthropy. 
Every month, the victim's condition manifests with the full moon; 
after each attack, the victim can make another saving throw vs. 
spell to see if the spell's effects wear oft. 

Almost any type of standard lycanthropy can be induced with 
this spell By using the blood of a normal animal as a spell compo¬ 
nent, the wizard can cause the victim to assume that were- form. 

Lycanthropy manifests the night of the full moon, as well as the 
night immediately before, and the night immediately after, the 
full moon. During those nights, the character gains no benefits 
from sleep or normal healing, and loses all memory of events 
which happen while in animal form, In all respects, the character 
gains the abilities, immunities, defenses, and bloodlust of an in¬ 
fected lycanthrope; it cannot transmit lycanthropy. When the 
three-night attack is over the victim can make another saving 
throw, wiLh a -3 penalty, to throw 1 off the spells effects. 

A remove curse allows the character to roll a saving throw vs. 
polymorph; success means the curse is broken, A wish also dis¬ 
pels the curse. No other spells can remove the curse. 


Contracting lycanthropy: Although the forms of attack vary with 
each species, all true lycanthropes can transmit their dreadful af¬ 
fliction. Any humanoid creature injured by a lycanthrope but 
not actually killed (and presumably eaten) has a chance to con¬ 
tract lycanthropy. This chance equals 1% per point of damage 
caused by the lycanthrope. Some lycanthropes transmit their af¬ 
fliction only through their bite, others through any natural at¬ 
tack and some even through the weapons they use. For ease of 
bookkeeping, if a character suffers 24 points of damage (from all 
attacks) from a true werewolf, the character has a 24% chance to 
become an infected werewolf. 

If the character eats belladonna within an hour of the attack, 
there is a 25% chance this will cure the affliction; it definitely 
incapacitates the character lor ld4 days. Note that only a sprig of 
belladonna need be eaten, and it must be reasonably fresh 
(picked within the last week). If too much is eaten, the character 
may still be cured, but is incapacitated for 2d4 days. 

The only other way to lift the affliction is to cast a remove 
curse on the character, on the night of a full moon, or the night 
immediately preceding or following the full moon. After remove 
curse is cast, if the character makes a successful saving throw vs, 
polymorph, the curse is broken. Otherwise the changes take 
place and the spell has no effect. Cure disease and other healing 
spells and abilities have no effect against lycanthropy. 

Only infected lycanthropes can be cured. To a true lycan- 
thmpe, lycanthropy is as natural as breathing, and the condition 
cannot be altered. True lycanthropes have complete control over 
their physical states; lhey are not affected by darkness, phases of 
the moon, or any of the other situations w T hich traditionally af¬ 
fect infected lycanthropes. 

Combat: In human form, the lycanthrope uses weapons to at¬ 
tack. They tend to use natural attack abilities in other forms. 


230 





lycanthrope, General 


In lycanthrope form, the monster can be struck only by silver 
or magical weapons. Wounds from any other weapon heal too 
quickly to cause actual damage. Damage from spells, acid, fire, 
and other special effects apply normally. Because of their vulner¬ 
ability to silver, some lycanthropes have a psychological aver¬ 
sion to the metal and refuse to handle it; in some cases, the 
psychosomatic effect is so great that touching silver actually 
bums the lycanthrope, 

Habitat/Society; True lycanthropes can change shape at will, re¬ 
gardless of the time of day or phase of the moon. Infected iycan- 
thropes are usually humanoid during the day, When darkness 
falls on the night of a full moon, or on the night immediately 
preceding or immediately following a full moon, the infected ly¬ 
canthrope unwillingly changes shape and is overcome by blood- 
lust. During this time, an infected PC is beyond the players 
control; the DM takes over the character. 

The character's Strength increases temporarily to 19, Armor 
Class, number of attacks, movement rate, and immunities, be¬ 
come identical to those of the type of lycanthrope that bit the 
character The transformed character wants only to hunt and 
kill, and usually selects either personal friends or enemies as vic¬ 
tims. The werecreature makes no distinction between friends and 
enemies; all that matters is the Strength of the emotion binding 
them, 

When the character returns to normal form, 10% to 60% 
(td6 x 10) of any wounds suffered while in animal form heal in¬ 
stantly The character also has hazy haunting memories of per¬ 
forming terrible acts. 

Each type of lycanthrope has its own language as well as its 
humanoid language; some may be able to speak the languages 
used by the animals they imitate, 

True lycanthropes tend to avoid human society unless attack¬ 
ing or on an errand. Lycanthropes travel alone or In packs. The 
packs are usually of similar lycanthropes, but may also include 
normal animals or monsters whom the lycanthropes resemble. 
Some lycanthropes have the ability to summon such creatures. 

Ecology: Lycanthropes fit a variety of roles, depending on the 
type of creatures they become, scavengers act as scavengers, 
predators as predators. See individual descriptions for more de¬ 
tails. 

Designing New Types of Lycanthrope 

Described here is a process for creating variant lycanthropes, ei¬ 
ther as true lycanthropes, one-shot opponents, or for the results 
of a curse of lycanthropy 

Animal Type: Virtually any predator between the size of a small 
dog and a large bear can be the basis for a type of lycanthrope. 
Most {but not all) true lycanthropes are mammals; most (but not 
all) are carnivores. An animal type used by the DM to create a 
race of true lycanthropes should be a carnivorous mammal with 
animal Intelligence (1), or rarely, a reptile, bird, or even Bsh with 
animal Intelligence There has never been a reliable report of a 
were-amphibian of any type. 

Induced lycanthropes, by spell or item, can be created using a 
wide variety of animal types, and even monstrous creatures. 

Appearance: In humanoid form, the lycanthrope has subtle indi¬ 
cations of the curse, ranging from hair color like that of the ani¬ 
mal to general facial type, to voice and actions. In animal form, 
the lycanthrope resembles a large version of the normal animal 
(but not so large as to be immediately noticeable). On close in¬ 


spection, the animal form's eyes show a faint spark of unnatural 
intelligence, and often glow red in the dark. 

The lycanthrope may also have a third form, part human and 
part animal. This form is usually humanoid in general shape, and 
the body has the same covering as the animal (usually fur. some¬ 
times scales or feathers). Facial features and body shape change 
somewhat, gaining more characteristics of the animal (fangs, 
whiskers, daws, animal leg structure, etc,), 

Statistics and Attributes: To determine the new lycanthrope s sta¬ 
tistics, extrapolate from those of the base animal and from exist¬ 
ing lycanthrope types, If the base animal is more powerful than a 
wolf, the new lycanthrope should have more Hit Dice than a 
werewolf; if the base animal is similar to a giant rat, the new 
werecreature should have about the same Hit Dice as a wererat. 
In almost every case, the new lycanthrope should have at least 1- 
2 Hit Dice more than the base animal. 

The lycanthrope gets the same attack forms as the base animal 
type, such as daws, bite, tail slap, head butt, or whatever. The 
damage should be very similar to that caused by the base animal. 
Many lycanthropes associate with animals of their base type, and 
the werebeast should be able to dominate such a group. 

Armor Class depends on the base animaVs natural toughness, 
speed, and dexterity. The lycanthrope should have a slightly bet¬ 
ter AC than the base animal, perhaps by 1 or 2 places. 

Movement rate should be the same as that of the base animal, 
as should diet and habitat. Morale should be about one category 
better than that of the base animak 

The creature's alignment tends to be an extrapolated version of 
the base animal's alignment. Since most base animals are neutral, 
the DM must look at the animal's tendencies. If the animal is a 
vicious predator and a strong fighter, the Ivcanthropic version is 
probably evil; it tries to stay out of the way of other creatures, it 
may be good or neutral. If the animal is very independent, the 
lycanthrope should be chaotic; if the animal is very methodical 
and has regular habits, the lycanthrope is probably lawful. 

Vulnerability; True lycanthropes share a vulnerability to silver 
weapons, possibly because of the metal's mystical relationship 
with the moon, or the inherent qualities or powers of the metal 
itself. Extremely rare variants might have no such vulnerability, 
but instead may have developed a weakness for another precious 
metal (gold and copper being the most likely), or perhaps for 
bronze, obsidian, or even wood. 

Special Abilities: In addition to their abilities of shapeshifting, 
calling normal animals to their aid, and so forth, some lycan¬ 
thropes have other special powers. These should not be rolled 
randomly for a new lycanthrope type, but chosen to fit with the 
attitude and style of the base animal. A few samples are listed 
below, 

• Thief skills, level 1-6 

• Charm person by gaze or voice 

• Regeneration (except for damage from silver weapons) 

• Wizard spells, casting level J-o 

• Cause fear 

• Psionirist abilities, level 1-6 

• Cast sleep, once per day 

• Poison

The seawolves are humans who can assume a form combining as¬ 
pects of a sea] and a wolf. Their packs roam the seas in search of ships 
to attack . 

The monstrous form of the lesser seawolf has the 6 to 7 foot long 
body of a seal. The head and shoulders are those of a wolf. In human 
form the lesser sea wolves stand 3 to 6 feet talh All are thickly mus¬ 
cled and have tiny ears and long hair that covers their head and 
shoulders like a mane. The lesser seawolf has a hybrid form of a wolf- 
man, a humanoid shape that retains the seawolfs teeth, claws, and 
fur: statistics for this form are given in parentheses above. 

Combat; Lesser seawolves approach a ship in seawolf form, then 
change into the hybrid form and climb aboard. There they use their 
teeth and claws to kill their opponents, If the ship looks too heavily 
defended, the seawolves may gnaw holes in the hull in order to sink 
the ship. 

Unlike most other lycanthropes, lesser seawolves have no special 
protection against normal weapons. Dead seawolves revert to their 
human form in a single round. 

Habitat/Society: Most seawolves were formerly fishermen or sail¬ 
ors; as such, they also tend to be male and human. They travel in 
packs with those of their own kind. Their fierce hatred of their form¬ 
er coworkers drives them to seek to kill them or pass on the lyean- 
thropic curse. Victims who acquire the disease become seawolves in 
2*5 days. Once night falls, the new seawolf slips into the water and 
goes off in search of a pack. 

Seawolves are nomads constantly roaming the cooler sections of 
the seas. They neither build lairs nor keep treasure. During the day, 
they sleep on beaches or in caves or appropriated houses. If surprised 
on a beach, they pretend to be shipwreck victims, then kill the in¬ 
truders and take their clothing. If at sea. the seawolves are still able to 
sleep during the day by floating on their backs: in this case they may 
be mistaken fora duster of drowning victims. If a ship moves dose to 
investigate, the sea wolves wait for the best opportunity to attack and 
take over the ship. 

Seawolves breathe air. They can remain submerged for 17-24 
Ud§+ 16) minutes. Failure to surface after that time causes them to 
suffer 1-6 points of damage each round until they drown. 

Female seawolves give birth to single cubs. These may appear to be 



human infants during the day or baby seals at night. Seawolves lack 
parental feelings and abandon the cubs Although the cubs are able 
to swim and hunt from birth, they have difficulty keeping up with 
adults and often drown during the day if they are at sea. Only 5% of 
cubs reach adulthood. The offspring of a seawolf and a human are 
good swimmers who feel mysteriously drawn to the sea, but few 
(25%) become seawolves upon reaching adolescence. 

Seawolves may ally themselves with other evil aquatic lycan- 
thropes. They hate selkies, whom they consider allies of the human¬ 
oids. Lesser seawolves attack selkies on sight. 

Their diet includes a variety of foods, such as shellfish, fish, sea¬ 
birds, sea mammals, and anyone they can sink their teeth into. Occa¬ 
sionally packs may wander into a town and take over a tavern for a 
round of drinking and wenching. 

Seawolf personalities are a twisted version of their original, human 
personalities. It is as if the seawolf persona is a savage, magnified 
version of all the original person s bad traits. Seawolves periodically 
return to their original home port. This may be a subconscious long¬ 
ing for their old life or a means to renew their hatred of those still 
humanoid. If a seawolf spots his old self's mate or child, he may at¬ 
tempt to make contact. 

Ecology: Seawolves are the sworn enemies ot any humanoid who 
makes his living in the sea. They live to destroy shipping, spread ter¬ 
ror. and spread their curse further. 

Greater Seawolves 

The monstrous form of the greater seawolf has a 12 to 15 foot long 
body, but is otherwise Identical to the lesser seawolf . In human form, 
greater seawolves stand 6 to 7 feet tall, 

Combat; Greater seawolves assume their human forms to get dose 
to their opponents. The typical plan is to bite or strangle one or two 
deckhands, take their weapons, and begin a general assault. 

In seawolf form, greater seawolves can be harmed only by silver, 
cold iron, or magical weapons of +1 or better, Steel weapons have 
no effect. Dead seawolves revert to their human form in one round.

Like the other species of lycanthrope found in Raven I oft P two va¬ 
rieties of werebat exist—natural (or true) and infected. True 
werebats are those creatures who have been born to werebat par¬ 
ents. The parents may be either true or infected werebats them¬ 
selves but the offspring of any two werebats is a true werebat. In 
those rare cases when a child is born with one werebat and one 
human parent, there is a 50% chance that it will be a true werebat 
and a 25% chance that it will be an infected werebat. 

True werebats have three Forms: normal human, vampire bat, 
or hybrid. In the first form, it is marked by bat-like features and 
traits (an aversion to bright lights, keen night vision, a taste for 
blood or raw meat, etc.), In its vampire bat form, it looks just 
like a common vampire bat. By far the most feared of its forms, 
however, is that of the hybrid. In this form, it retains its human¬ 
oid shape but takes on the added features of a bat. The arms ex¬ 
tend to become willowy and leather wings form under them, the 
teeth sharpen into deadly fangs* and the snout protrudes from 
the face. The nails stretch into deadly claws and the eyes spawn 
an inner glow when light hits them. 

Infected werebats have only two of the three forms listed 
above. Most (75%) have a human and hybrid form* while the 
rest have only a human and true bat form. 

Combat: The type of attacks employed by a werebat depend 
upon its form. In human form, it will depend upon weapons to 
inflict damage, for its bare hands inflict but ld2 points per at¬ 
tack. li at a\\ possible, the creature will avoid combat in this 
form. 

In bat form, they attack just as if they were bats. Each round, 
they may attack once and inflict but a single point of damage 
with any successful strike. The bitten victim, of course, stands a 
chance of contracting lycanthropy (see below), even from this 
meager wound. Opponents of a werebat in this form will find 
that it is unusually resilient, for it has its full human-form hit 
points. 

In hybrid form, the werebat does not have the manual dexteri¬ 
ty to employ weapons effectively. However, its deadly sharp 
claws and needle-like teeth make it far from helpless. In each 
round it may strike twice with its daws (inflicting ld4 points of 
damage each), If both of these attacks hits, it may follow with a 
vicious bite that does 2d4 points of damage. Werebats can fly in 
their hybrid form and often use this ability to their advantage in 
combat. 



Anyone who takes damage from a werebat s natural attacks 
stands a chance of contracting the disease of lycanthropy and be¬ 
coming an infected werebat. Every point of damage done Indi¬ 
cates a flat 2% chance per point that the victim will become 
infected. The procedures for curing an infected lycanthrope are 
given in Chapter 5 of the Ravenloft Boxed Set. 

Werebats can be harmed only by silver or +1 or belter magical 
weapons. Any wound inflicted by another type of weapon knits 
as quickly as it is inflicted, hinting al Ihe creatures true nature. 

Habitat/Society: Werebats favor caves in lightly wooded, tem¬ 
perate regions as their homes. From here, they can fly out and 
seek prey from which they can draw the blood necessary to sat¬ 
isfy their thirst. 

Werebat caves are commonly home to only one family of 
werebats (two parents and 1-4 young). The young remain in true 
bat form until they reach 3 years of age, A this time, they mature 
into adults and, within a single year, become fully grown. This 
time of transformation brings out a great hunger in the creature, 
which forces it to spend most of its time hunting and feeding. 
Human villages near a werebat cave will certainly lose many citi¬ 
zens to the feasting of the ravenous creature at this time. 

In addition to the werebat family, each cave will contain 20- 
200 (20diO) common bats and 1-10 giant bats. AH of these lesser 
are under the command of the adult werebats and will act as their 
sentinels and companions. 

Ecology: Although werebats favor humans and demihumans as 
prey they have been known to feed on the blood of other mam¬ 
mals (like cattle and horses) when preferred prey is not available, 
Interestingly such animals seem to be immune to the lycanthro¬ 
py that these dark creatures spread. 

While werebats do look upon humans and demihumans as ani¬ 
mals to be devoured, they are not cruel or evil in their attacks. 
They simply regard such beings as having a lower place in the 
food chain. Werebats will, typically refer to themselves as 'pred¬ 
ators of the nights

Werebear? are humans who can transform themselves into large 
brown bears. They are the best known good-aligned lycan- 
thropes. The ursine form most often resembles a brown bear. 
Some have blond, reddish, black, or ivory fur (the latter is com¬ 
mon in frozen regions). 

In human form they are large, stout, well-muscled, and hairy. 
Their brown hair is thick; males usually wear beards, Some have 
reddish, blond, ivory or black hair; this matches the color of the 
ursine form. They dress in simple cloth and leather garments that 
are easily removed, repaired, or replaced, 

Combat: In human form, the werebear uses available weapons, 
preferring axes, spears, and knives, since these have practical ap¬ 
plications suitable for woodland life. If attacked in daylight, the 
werebear usually remains human unless death is likely. The 
shapechange renders the werebear helpless for a round. In ursine 
form, the werebear attacks with tw p o swiping daws and a bite. If 
both claws hit, during the next round the werebear can hug for an 
additional 2-16 points of damage. This subsequent damage con¬ 
tinues automatically each round thereafter. 

Like those of other lycanthropes, the werebears defenses func¬ 
tion only in the bear form. Weapons used against the werebear 
must be either silver or magical weapons of +1 or better. Were- 
bears can summon 1-6 brown bears within 2-12 turns, provided 
such animals are within one mile. Werebears heal at three times 
the normal human rate and can cure disease in another creature 
in 1-4 weeks if they so desire. 

If a werebear dies, he reverts to his human form in one round. 

HabitafSociety: Werebears are normally solitary creatures. As 
humans, they build cabins far from settled areas, preferably in a 
deep forest near well-stocked waters, Werebears do not marry 
although they may have preferred mates they meet on a very ir¬ 
regular basis. Females bear 1-2 children in human form. Such 
children are very stout and grow quickly. Within eight years they 
gain adolescence and the ability to change into werebears. Short¬ 
ly after, the mother drives the children out and seeks a mate to 
start the cycle anew'. The newly independent young are discreetly 



guided and assisted by older werebears. Despite their apparent 
isolationism and rugged individualism, werebears have a sense of 
community. They never attack each other and aid any werebear 
threatened by another lycanthrope species, 

Werebears are closest to fores towelling classes like rangers, 
druids, and wildlife-oriented priests. They rarely enter villages 
and never enter cities except in dire emergencies or to help other 
good-aligned people, especially those threatened by evil lycan¬ 
thropes. Werebears hate wererats and werewolves. 

The average werebear claims a territory 1 to 4 square miles in 
size. Fishing areas are open to all werebears. A werebear feels a 
dose bond to its home region, acting as a game warden to protect 
its territory and the animals therein from the ravages of in¬ 
truders, 

Werebears do not travel a great deal. Only the rare individual 
(usually young) can be coaxed into (Dining a band of adventur¬ 
ers. Werebears may join an adventuring group as guides, provid¬ 
ed the money is right and the job is agreeable. 

Treasure is usually limited to small, valuable commodities like 
gold, platinum, gems, and jewelry. Werebears rarely carry any 
treasure and instead hide it near their homes. They also collect 
scrolls, potions, and other magical items, often as fees or rewards 
for past services, Werebears destroy any magical items that spe- 
dfically affect lycanthropes or bears, since such items might be 
used against themselves. 

Ecology: Werebears are omnivorous, preferring fish, small 
mammals, and a honey-rich mead. This mead is extremely intox* 
icating to normal humans. Werebears have few natural enemies. 
Their closest enemies are the werewolves who share their prefer* 
red wilderness regions.

Wereboars are humans who are able to transform themselves in¬ 
to a form combining human and boar features. Their tempers are 
as ugly as their features. 

In human form wereboars tend to be stocky muscular people 
of average height. Their hair is short and stiff. They dress in sim¬ 
ple garments that are easy to remove, repair, or replace. 

The boar form stands slightly taller than the human form, but 
the hunchbacked posture thrusts the head forward. The head is 
identical to a boars head, complete with short tusks. The torsos 
diameter is doubled, the neck shortened, and the feet become 
hoof-like. Stiff, black hair like wire bristles covers the skin. 

Combat: The wereboar combines his hands and tusks For dead¬ 
ly effect. The wereboar seizes a target and pulls it toward his 
head. He stabs his tusks into the victim, then pulls his victim to 
one side white swinging his head in the other direction, which 
tears the wound further. He then tosses the victim aside and at¬ 
tacks someone else. A wereboar will gladly wade into the center 
of a group of opponents and then fight his way out. 

In human form the wereboar attacks with whatever weapon he 
has, Wereboars prefer bludgeoning or chopping weapons, such 
as axes and maces, rather than stabbing or missile weapons such 
as swords, spears, or hows. 

Ln either form the wereboar is immune to damage from non- 
magicai and nonsilver weapons, Such wounds are little more 
than scratches that quickly heal. 

Habitat Society: Wereboars are ill-tempered, easily angered, 
and almost as prone to attack their few friends as they are to at¬ 
tack an enemy. As humans they are rude, crude, and vulgar. 
However, they are invaluable allies in a fight. A wereboar does 
not give his friendship easily, but when he does it is a special 
bond he will not break. The problem is, due to the wereboars 
peculiar personality, it is difficult to tell whether he is being 
friendly or hostile. 

Wereboars prefer dense woodlands, ideally far from towns and 
cities. Like werebears, they live in caves or build cabins for their 
homes. Their homes tend to be ill-kept and slovenly. Wereboars 
don't repair things, they replace them. 



Despite their personalities, wereboars have close-knit families. 
Females give birth to litters of ld4 + 2 offspring. Newborns are 
very small by human standards but are strong and able to crawl 
hours afterbirth. The offspring mature quickly. When they reach 
adolescence at eight years, they gain the ability to become were¬ 
boars themselves. A wereboar father appears to be distant and 
aloof, but a staunch protector who will attack any foe who 
threatens his family no matter how uneven the odds. Females are 
aggressive when defending their young ( +2 bonus to attack roll). 
Neither males nor females check morale when defending their 
young. 

The diet is a mixture of small game, vegetables, and fungi. 
Their favorite food is the subterranean fungus called truffles; 
even in human form they can detect the truffles growing several 
feet underground. Wereboars aren't very good gardeners. A typi¬ 
cal garden is a cleared field strewn with a variety of seeds and 
bulbs in the hope that something edible will grow. Wereboar cui¬ 
sine is equally haphazard; it can be summed up as burned meat 
and stews. 

Wereboars avoid normal hogs and boars. They are suspicious 
of strangers. Wereboars assume everyone is hostile. In human 
form they may wait for the first attack, but when in boar form 
they usually (75% chance) chase the intruders away and attack 
any who defend themselves. 

Ecology: Wereboars produce little of value, whether trade 
goods or services. Their main desire is simply to stay away from 
everyone else. In the wild, they defend their territories against 
any intruders. Wereboars fit into orcish society as well as they do 
into human society, and might sometimes assist or ally them¬ 
selves with orcish forces. Wereboars can tolerate half-ores.

A foxwoman is an elven-appeariny woman who is able to trans¬ 
form herself into a silver fox form or a silver-furred humanoid 
(vixen) form with a fox's head. They are extremely self-centered. 

The female elven form of the foxwoman is extremely beautiful. 
She has silver or silver-streaked hair, including a widows peak. 
She dresses attractively in loose garments. A pouch holds valu¬ 
ables and spell components. 

The vixen form is a hybrid of elven and fox-like features. The 
body and limbs are those of the elven form but covered with sil¬ 
very fur. The head and tail are fox-like. The vixen may wear el¬ 
ven clothing* The vixen can run very quickly (18). 

The silver fox form appears to be a normal, large fox* It moves 
extremely fast (24), can pass tairirouf trace, and is 90% undetect¬ 
able in undergrowth if it passes out of view for a moment. 

Com bat: The silver fox s bite inflicts 1 -2 points of damage but is 
otherwise harmless. The vixens more savage bite causes 2d6 
points of damage. Human or elven women who are bitten by a 
vixen for 50% or more of their hit points become foxwomen 
within three days unless both a cure disease and a remote curse 
spell are cast upon the victim by a priest of at least 12th level. 

In elven form, the foxwoman relies on weapons. She gains a 
+ 1 bonus with bow or sword. Her best weapon is her incredible 
beauty. Any human, humanoid, or demihuman males whose 
Wisdoms are 13 or less are effectively caught by a charm spell. 
Those whose Wisdoms are 14 or greater are not charmed but still 
find the foxwoman extremely attractive. In elven form, the fax- 
woman has magic use as a wizard of level ld4. She is 90% resist¬ 
ant to sleep and charm spells. 

In any form, the foxwoman is able to see by Lnfravision (60- 
foot range). They can only be harmed by silver or +1 or better 
magical weapons. Scars from nonfatal wounds vanish within a 
month. 



vain, and hedonistic. Foxwomen serve their vanity by enslaving 
humanoid males. Those males become servants and companions* 
Werefoxes do not keep dwarves, gnomes, or half lings; such 
males are slain quietly as soon as the opportunity arises. 

Each foxwoman is always accompanied by Ld4 + I charmed 
males. At least one of the males is a fighter (70%) or ranger 
(30%) of level ld4 + 1. There is a 50% chance that any one of the 
other males is also a fighter of level ld4. There is a 10% chance 
that one of the remaining males is a cleric (10%), druid (45%), 
mage (10%), thief (25%) ( or some other class (10%) of level ld4. 
Of her elven or half-elven companions, 25% are multi-class char¬ 
acters* All males who do not fit into any of the above categories 
are 0-level fighters and elves or halbelves of 1 Hit Die, The males 
may use such magical items as they possessed prior to being 
charmed into the foxwoman's service, 

Foxwomen are barren. They must kidnap or adopt their chil¬ 
dren. There is a 10% chance that a foxwoman has a "daughter: 1 
The foxwoman has stolen an elven girl, infected her with lycan- 
thropy, and is raising her as a foxwoman. Such a child is be 
ld8 + 5 years old* If she is 12-13, she is treated the same as a nor¬ 
mal foxwoman: otherwise she is a noncombatanL 

Non-elven women who are afflicted with iycanthropy undergo 
a slow transformation that alters their normal form. Over a peri¬ 
od of one to two years, such women turn into elven women; only 
their faces and odd marks (tattoos, birthmarks) provide faint 
proof of their old identities. 


Habitat Society: Foxwomen dwell in lonely woodlands far 
from humanoid communities* Their homes may be hidden cot¬ 
tages or comfortably furnished cave complexes: in either case 
their homes are filled with typical human comforts. Foxwomen 
are solitary in regard to their own kind. They are self-serving. 


Ecology; Foxwomen are unique among the lycanthropes. They 
have no major goals or desires aside from pampering themselves 
and feeding their vanity. They have little contact with other fox¬ 
women (whom they see as rivals), real foxes (irrelevant beasts), 
or other lycanthropes (crude, unattractive, and uncharmable).

Wererats, also called ratmen, are humans who can transform 
themselves into three forms—human, human-sized ratman. and 
giant rat. They are sly and evil, and usually inhabit tunnel com¬ 
plexes beneath cities. 

The wererats human form tends to be a thin, wiry individual 
of shorter than average height. His eyes constantly dart around, 
and his nose and mouth may twitch if he is excited. Males often 
have thin, ragged moustaches. 

The ratman form is somewhat shorter than the human form. 
The head, torso, and tail are identical to those of a rat, but the 
limbs remain human. 

The third form is that of a giant rat 2 feet from nose to rump. 
This form is identical to that of the giant rat (q.vj, This is the 
preferred form for travel and spying on potential victims. 

Were rats are often followed by 1-6 mice or rats that are instinc¬ 
tively drawn to them but are not controlled by them. 

Combat: In aU three forms, wererats rely on weapons for their 
attacks, preferring shortswords and daggers. Anyone who is in¬ 
jured by a true wererat has a 1 % chance per point of damage of 
becoming a wererat. In their ratman and giant rat forms, were¬ 
rats can be hurt only by silver or magical weapons. 

Wererats prefer to attack from ambush, A favorite tactic is to 
assume human shape and lure unsuspecting victims into a trap. 
This is the only time wererats are voluntarily alone. Victims are 
then robbed, held for ransom, or eaten. 

Each wererat is able to summon and control 2-12 giant rats. 



sewers and escape their attention. Unfortunately for the wererat, 
the sewer s stains and smells do not vanish when it assumes hu¬ 
man form. This effectively limits wererats to the less savory sec¬ 
tions of town as well as reducing the number of humans who 
might unknowingly mate with a wererat, 

Wererats see cities as their hunting grounds. They delight in 
matching their superior intellects and meager physical skills 
against the more powerful and numerous humans, Bui they are 
no fools; they will not attack unless they are sure they can win. If 
a battle is going against them, wererats will scatter, transform to 
rat form, and head for the sanctuary of the sewers. They won't 
even defend their own fairs. Their attitude is that since they had 
stolen most of their belongings in the first place, they can always 
replace them. 

Wererats are greedy and collect anything they think might 
have worth. The resulting trove usually has more junk than trea¬ 
sure, but a thorough search may reveal a wide variety of valu¬ 
ables. 

Wererats frequent sleazy taverns, both for the cheap alcohol 
and to follow drunks Into the streets to drag them away lor the 
next day's meal. 


Habitat Society: Wererats live in packs, regardless of form, 
never being alone if they can help it. Solitary wererats are either 
sole survivors or engaged in mischief. They do not form interper¬ 
sonal bonds like love or marriage. In fact, wererats rarely mate 
with their own kind. Offspring of a wererat and a human woman 
are human, although they are small, like their fathers. Offspring 
of a female wererat resemble giant rats with human-like paws. 
These ratlings grow to maturity in two years and gain the ability 
to transform themselves into human children with an apparent 
age about three times that of the ratling's actual age. 

Wererats prefer subterranean lairs hidden among the sewers 
and catacombs beneath cities. Nothing can pass through the 


Ecology: Wererats are parasites. They recognize that they are 
physically weaker than most species that dominate the surface. 
They have found and exploited the one niche where they have a 
chance to dominate, the world beneath the cities. They feed on 
humans and steal their riches. Humans unknowingly protect the 
wererats from both surface dwelling creatures and those who 
mighl burrow up from far below. Besides, the humans pay for 
the upkeep of the wererat s sewer realm. 

Psychologically, wererats remind humans that no matter how 
strongly defended they think they are, monsters can still get in. 
Mothers describe wererats as bogeymen to scare unruly children.

We re ravens are a race of wise and good-aligned shapechangers 
who seem to have migrated to Ravenloft from another realm 
(probably Greyhawk) centuries ago. While they are no longer 
round on their plane of origin, they have managed to survive in 
Ravenloft 

Natural wereravens have three forms, that of a normal human, 
a huge raven, and a hybrid of the two. Infected wereravens can 
assume only two of the above forms. While all infected 
wereravens can take the human form, roughly half are able to 
turn into hybrids while the others can transform into huge rav¬ 
ens. 

The hybrid form of these creatures looks much like that of a 
we rebat. The arms grow long and thin, sprouting feathers and 
transforming into wings. The mouth hardens and projects into a 
straight, pecking beak, and the eyes turn jet black, A coat of 
feathers replaces the normal body hair of the human form. 

Combat: Wereravens are deadly opponents in close combat, al¬ 
though they seldom engage in it. Because they can be hit only by 
silver weapons or those with a + 2 or better magical bonus, these 
creatures do not fear most armed parties. 

When in human form, a wereraven retains its natural immuni¬ 
ties to certain weapons, but has no real attack of its own. If 
forced to fight unarmed, it inflicts a mere 1-2 points of damage. 
For this reason, wereravens in human form often employ weap¬ 
ons, doing damage appropriate to the arms they wield. 

In raven form, the wereraven attacks as if it were a common 
example of that creature. Thus, it inflicts but 1-2 points of dam¬ 
age but has a 1 in 10 chance of scoring an eye peck with each 
successful attack. Any eye peck will cause the target to lose the 
use of one eye until a heal or regeneration spell can be cast on the 
victim. Half-blinded persons (those who have lost 1 eye) suffer a 
-2 on all attack rolls. A second eye peck results in total blind¬ 
ness until the above cure can be affected. 

In hybrid form the wereraven's arms have grown into wings, 
making them almost useless in combat. However, the muscles in 
their mouths, beaks strengthen, giving them a savage bite. Each 
attack made with the creatures beak inflicts 2d6 points of 
damage. 

Anyone bitten or pecked by the wereraven has a 2% chance 
per point of damage inflicted of becoming an infected wereraven. 
Infected lycanthropes are discussed in the Rfrvenloft Boxed Set. 



Wereravens are strong flyers and often use this ability to their 
advantage in combat. 

Habitat/Society: A wereraven family will be found only at the 
heart of a dense forest. Here, they live in the hollowed out body 
of a great tree. Entrance to their lair is possible only from above 
(if one does not wish to cut or break through the trunk itself). 
Curiously, the wereravens are able to keep the tree in which they 
nest from dying even after they have hollowed it out, so it is diffi¬ 
cult to distinguish from the normal trees around it. 

Wereravens recognize that they are bastions of good in a land 
dominated by evil. They have managed to survive by avoiding 
large populations or overt acts of good that would draw the at¬ 
tention of the reigning lords to them. Thus, a wereraven flock 
will generally have no more than 2-8 adults in it. Of course, such 
groups have young with them (1-4 per 2 adults), but these are 
seldom encountered for they remain in a true raven state until 
they are old enough to fend for themselves. In addition, a typical 
wereraven lair will draw 10-100 flOdlO) common ravens to nest 
in the trees about it These wise birds will serve the wereravens, 
doing their bidding and striving to protect them from harm, 

Wereravens are not opposed to helping out the cause of good 
in Ravenloft, but they do so reluctantly. This is not because they 
do not wish to do good, but because they fear the wrath of the 
Dark Powers, It is said that the wereravens have come to the aid 
of endangered Vistani dans on several occasions and that close 
ties exist between these two races, but neither will admit this 
openly. 

Ecology: Wereravens are omnivores who prefer to maintain a 
vegetarian diet. They enjoy berries and nuts, but will eat carrion 
or kill for fresh meat from time to time in order to maintain good 
health.

Weretigers are humans, usually female, that have the ability to 
transform into tigerlike forms. They have a strong affinity for all 
felines. 

The human form tends to be sleekly muscular, taHer than aver¬ 
age, and very agile. The voices of weretigers are husky and they 
tend to roll their r's. 

The weretiger form is a hybrid between a human and a tiger. It 
is about 25% larger than the human form, and is covered by 
tiger-striped hide. A 3-foot tail extends from the spine. The legs 
are more feline than human; this form walks on its toes. The head 
is also a mixture of features. The ears, nose, muzzle, and teeth are 
tigerlike, but the eyes and overall shape are human. If the human 
form's hair is long, it is still present. The fingernails grow into 
claws, Despite the changes, the hybrid form can pass for human 
at a distance if properly disguised. 

The third form is that of a fully grown tiger without any trace 
of human features. 

Weretigers speak the languages of all feline breeds, so normal 
felines, including the great cats, have a 75% chance of being 
friendly toward a weretiger. Even feline monsters have a 25% 
chance of being automatically friendly. However, weretigers are 
rarely found in the company of real tigers, being only 5% likely 
to be accompanied by them. 

Combat: In either tiger form, the weretiger attacks with a varie¬ 
ty of punches, raking daws, and bites. The weretigers punches 
are so strong that they cause 1-4 points of damage. Otherwise the 
daws can be raked across an opponent, causing 2-5 points of 
damage. The teeth are the most dreadful weapon. They can tear 
a victim apart or crush a windpipe. Weretigers usually bite only 
in their full tiger form. 

In human form, the weretiger uses a wide variety of weapons 
with which it is adept, A weretiger is also good at unarmed com¬ 
bat; it retains its deadly punch in this form, as well as an en¬ 
hanced sense of smell and night vision. 

Ha bitaf Society: For various reasons were tigresses outnumber 
weretigers five to one. 

Weretigers travel alone or in small prides. They do not marry 
but have preferred mates, which may be either humans or tigers. 



Weretigers give birth to one or two cubs. The cubs are the hybrid 
form; they look like fuzzy human babies with tails. Cubs mature 
quickly. They can crawl within days, walk within a month, and 
hunt within a year. Their physical size matches that of a human 
child of three times the same age. At age six, they reach adoles¬ 
cence and gain the ability to transform into a fully human form. 
At age 12, they gain the ability to assume a full-tiger form; this is 
considered the mark of adulthood. 

li a male weretiger mates with either a real tigress or human 
woman, the offspring initially has the same appearance as the 
mother. Lycanthropic transformations do not begin until the hy¬ 
brid reaches adolescence. 

Weretigers are omnivorous. In the wild they roam a territory 
of 7-10 (ld4 +6) square miles. Their homes are usually near hu¬ 
man settlements. These tend to be well kept cabins with small 
herb and vegetable gardens. The only livestock will be a variety 
of cats and some poultry. 

Weretigers rarely live in confined settings such as cities or large 
towns because their lycanthropic nature would be hard to con¬ 
ceal- If found m such a setting, one or two weretigers in human 
form will be on an errand, such as a mission, a revel ora simple 
shopping trip, In any form, weretigers are very confident and not 
prone to attack unless provoked. 

Treasure varies widely acquired as payment for past services, 
plunder from past adventures, or scavenged from the remains of 
past opponents. Weretigers have an affinity for gems and often 
keep a small cache hidden somewhere near their homes. 

Ecology: Weretigers are the most adaptable of the Ivcan- 
thropes. They are equally at home in human, feline, or monster 
company.

Werewolves are the most feared of the lycanthropes, men who 
can transform into wolflike beasts. They should not be confused 
with walfweres (q.vj—wolves who turn into men. Great enmity 
exists between werewolves and wolfweres. 

The human forms of werewolves have no distinguishing traits. 
The werewolf form is equally varied. Many have a bipedal form 
that is a hybrid of human and lupine features. These creatures are 
about IToot taller and stronger than their human forms. The 
bodies are fur-covered and have short tails, wotflike legs, and 
heads that are combinations in varying degrees of human and 
lupine features, 

A second form of hybrid is more wolflike, and may be mis¬ 
taken for a large wolf when it runs on all four legs. This hybrid 
can also walk erect and has humanlike hands. 

Another type of werewolf (about 20%) looks exactly like a 
large wolf about the size of a bear. This creature has no human 
features, although the eyes may glow red in the dark. 

Combat: In their human forms, werewolves attack with a vari¬ 
ety of weapons, generally those common to their human identity 
and class. In the werewolf or wolflike forms, the creature attacks 
with its fearsome teeth, if the form has hands, the werewolf may 
grab its prey for a better bite. 

In the wolf form, the werewolf can be harmed only by silver or 
magical weapons of +1 or better. Wounds from other weapons 
heal too quickly to actually injure the werewolf. 

Werewolves attack in packs; packs including females and young 
drive the adults to hit harder. If the female is attacked, the male 
fights at +2 to hit and does full damage with each blow. If the 
young are attacked, the female attacks at +3 to hit and does full 
damage. Cubs with 60% full growth are -4 to hit, cubs with 70% are 
-3 to hit. and so on. All cubs inflict 2-5 points of damage. 

Habitat Society: Werewolf packs roam the wilderness in search 
of human or other prey. True werewolves tend to be nomadic, 
although infected werewolves often continue to live the life to 
which they were accustomed. Werewolves retreat to their dens 
during the winter months or the years when the females are rais¬ 
ing the helpless cubs. As humans, werewolves do not build 
homes, although they may take over existing dwellings, some¬ 



times the home of past victims. Caves and burrows are the dens 
most commonly used in the wild. These sparsely furnished re¬ 
treats are used mostly as a sleeping area and a place to store their 
human possessions. Many werewolf families roam the country¬ 
side in wagons, much like gypsies. In fact, this has caused many 
gypsies to be accused of being werewolves. 

Werewolves live in packs, generally related by bloodlines, 
Werewolf packs of five to eight individuals are single family 
groups consisting of a male, female, and three to six cubs, six to 
nine years old. Cubs under six years old are kept in secluded dens 
and never encountered by hostile humans. 

When pregnant, the female retreats with her mate and an older 
female who will act as midwife. In a very secluded area they pre¬ 
pare a special den that will be home for the mother and her cubs 
for the next six years. The female gives birth to a litter of 5-10 
cubs. The cubs are born in the hybrid form; they resemble fuzzy 
human babies with wolflike faces. Infant mortality h high; 2-4 
cubs of each litter never reach 60% growth. Cubs grow at the 
same rate as humans for their first five years. By the sixth year 
they attain 60% of their full growth- At this point they develop 
the ability to transform into their other forms. Each following 
year brings an increase of an additional 10% growth, Were- 
wolves are considered mature at age 10, 

If a werewolf mates with a woman, the offspring is completely 
human. The temperament reflects the father; such children are 
violent, combative, and prone to mental illness. There is a 10% 
chance each year from the onset of adolescence that such a child 
will spontaneously transform into a true w r erewolf, 

Ecology: Werewolves are a peculiar hybrid of human and lu¬ 
pine personalities. They are savage killers, yet they are devoted 
to their close-knit families. Werewolves are hostile toward lycan¬ 
thropes who oppose them, especially werebears.

Mammals are the most common of the vertebrate. Generally 
bom alive, mammals possess hair. Warm-blooded, mammals 
maintain a single body temperature, regulated by an internal 
thermostat. Most mammals are harmless to humanoids and they 
are often trained to perform a specific function, 

Ape, Carnivorous: Carnivorous apes gain a *2 to their surprise 
rolls. They eat anything they can kill. 

Baboon, Wild: Wild baboons are large, herbivorous primates 
that are characterized by long arms and legs, large dog-like muz¬ 
zles. and sharp canine teeth. 

Badger: Badgers are vicious little creatures that prefer to run 
from danger than fight* If cornered, the badger will fight, at¬ 
tempting to bite the tender throat of its opponent, 

Banderlog: Banderlogs resemble baboons with green skin and 
brown fur. They throw retch plant fruit or coconuts at enemies. 
Coconuts cause ld4 + l points damage while retch plant fruit 
splash a 5-foot radius area with nauseating fluids. Those caught 
in the splash, retch for three rounds and their Strength is reduced 
by half for the next hour + no saving throw allowed. 

Bhaergala: This predator jumps its prey from great heights. It can 
drop from as high as 60 feet, causing maximum damage plus ld6 
for ever\ r 10 feet dropped. This beast heals 2 hit points every day 
and gains a +3 to all saving throws vs. poison, hour times a day 
the bhaergala can turn spells as the ting of spell turning. 

Boar. Wild: Wild boar continue to attack until they are reduced 
to "7 hit points* The giant boar is often called an alothere. 


Chattun Chatturs, called space bandits, are small mammals that 
exhibit traits of both primates and rodents. Not very combative, 
they fight in defense of their nests, km, or friends, 

Cooshee: Known as elven dogs, they only bark to warn their eh 
vert masters of danger. They can strike bipedal opponents with 
front paws to knock man-sized or smaller creatures down, 

Dakon: Dakons are intelligent apes with a reasonable grasp of 
the common tongue. When attacking it gains a +2 bonus. 

Debbi: This desert scavenger, a baboon-hyena crossbreed, can 
cause fear by stamping its feet in a slow, rhythm and calling forth 
magical power that makes its fur crackle and spark. This fear 
lasts for two rounds, 

Goat: When a goat charges, it gains a +2 attack bonus and does 
an additional 1-2 points damage. 

Gorilla: The gorilla is non-aggressive and shy but fights fiercely 
when threatened or cornered. 

H.singoing: The hsing-sing are a recluse ape-like race believed to 
personify the principles of pacifism and harmony with nature. 
However, once a year, for 2d6+4 days, the males gather into 
raiding bands and complete the "war season.” Their bands attack 
humanoid settlements on the edge of their territory. Such attacks 
are impartial; pillaging good and evil creatures alike. To maxi¬ 
mize the advantage of surprise, the hsing-sing rarely attack the 
same settlement two years in a row. 

Hyena: Often confused as a canine the hyena taunts enemies 
with its nervous, high-pitched howl.

Mammal 


Jackal; Jackals are timid scavengers that run from the threat of 
other predators. When attacking, the jackal darts in to bite its 
victim and quickly retreats to a safe distance. If more than one 
jackal is trying to down an animal they attack in a haphazard 
fashion with little or no coordination of effort. 

Losel: An arboreal ore baboon cross, losel resemble primitive 
humans m many respects. They can throw stones up to 20 yards 
for ld4 points damage. 

Monkey Spider: Measuring 1-inch in length, monkey spiders 
fight creatures their own size, avoiding combat with larger crea¬ 
tures* If forced to battle such creatures, the monkeys jump and 
bite at an eye, The bite causes extreme pain and the victim must 
hold his eye and take no other action for a round, giving the 
monkey a chance to run away. Monkey spiders can jump 10 feet 
down or 5 feet forward and can climb anything a typical spider 
can. 

Porcupine: Porcupines are covered with long barbed quills. The 
creature is unable to throw its quills. Generally, a predator who 
chases the fleeing creature gets a mouthful of quills which causes 
the damage cited above. 

Rathe: The rot he (pronounced "Toth-AY") is a musk ox-like crea¬ 
ture with an aversion to light. It prefers to live underground near 
lichen and moss. 

Skunk: Anyone within a skunks IDxlOxlO-foot cloud of musk 
must save vs. poison or be nauseated for 1-4 rounds, losing 50% 
of Strength and Dexterity, 

Sleek: This ermine-like mammal surprises opponents on 1-5 on 
Ido, On an attack roll of 19 or 20, the sleek opens a major vein, 
causing 2d6 points of damage. Every round thereafter, the victim 
suffers Ido more points damage until the wound is wrapped with 
a tourniquet, direct pressure, or magical healing. 

Stag, Wild; Wild stags are the aggressive males of the deer herds. 
Normally docile and passive, they defend their herds against all 
but the most fearsome opponents. 

Stench Kow: Stench Kme are the cattle of the lower planes. They 
are immune to all forms of cold, fire, and poison, in close quar¬ 
ters , their breath and bodies are so foul, a save vs. poison must 
be made or the character is affected as if struck by a stinking 
cloud spell The save must be made every three rounds of expo¬ 
sure. 

Taen These vile primates live in cold mountain caves. They 
throw spears before dosing in for hand-to-hand. 

Tyrg: When in melee, tyrgs emit fierce howls that mildly stun 
their victims t +2 penalty to initiative and ^2 penalty to attack 
rolls) for the next three rounds + no saving throw allowed. These 
are tiger-dog crossbreeds that move silently 75% of the time and 
have a +2 bonus to avoid surprise. 



Warthog: The warthog is so aggressive, it continues to attack un¬ 
til it reduced to ^7 hit points. 

Weasel: Weasels, related to minks and stoats, are common preda¬ 
tors, ihough they are hunted for their pelts, or for pets. 

Wolverine; When engaged in battle, the wolverine becomes a 
most fearsome adversary giving it a +4 bonus to Us attack roll. 

Minimal Mammals; Minimals are half-sized breeds of otherwise 
normal animals. They have the same physical and behavioral 
traits of their full-sized relatives, although most are not danger¬ 
ous. Minimals generally have one-half the number ot Hit Dice 
with a corresponding drop in THACO, a +2 Armor Class penal¬ 
ty, and a “2 Morale penalty. The damage caused by a minimal is 
one-half that of the full-sized relative. 

Giant Mammals; Giant mammals are double-sized breeds of 
otherwise normal animals. They have the same physical and be¬ 
havioral traits of their full-sized relatives. These giants generally 
have double the number of Hit Dice, a corresponding rise in 
THACO, a -2 AC bonus, and a +2 Morale bonus. The damage 
caused by the attacks of a giant mammal is twice that ol the toll- 
sized relative.

Herd animats live in all dimates and terrain, from freezing tun¬ 
dra (bactrian camel) to temperate hills (wild cattle) to tropical 
plains (antelope). Though normally passive, herd animals can be 
dangerous when angered or frightened. 

Herd animals are four-legged hoofed mammals covered with 
hair—thick fur for buffalo, curly wool for sheep, and short, 
coarse hair for camels, antelope, and sheep Male cattle, buffalo, 
antelope, and sheep have sharp horns. A camel's humps (one 
hum for dromedaries, two for bactrian) enable it to go without 
food or water for up to two weeks. 

Combat: Most herd animals attack by biting. Buffalo defend 
themselves with their horns, usually attacking if approached too 
closely (6' or less); if charging from a distance of at least 4Q J , a 
buffalo does 3-18 hp of impaling damage plus 1-4 hp of trampling 
damage. Nasty-tempered camels have a 50% chance of spitting 
at persons attempting to ride them or use them for pack animals; 
the victim of a spit attack has a 25% chance of being blinded for 
1-3 rounds. Cattle, antelope, and sheep generally flee from dan- 
ger. but will attack if cornered or threatened. A male antelope or 
sheep defending his herd will charge, inflicting 1-4 hp of butting 
damage if charging from at least 40\ Male cattle are 75% likely 
to attack if intruders approach before the herd has a chance to 
escape. 

If frightened by intruders, there is a 25% that the entire herd 
will stampede. If a herd stampedes, roll 2d4 for each creature in 
the path of the stampede who does not take cover (such as by 
hiding in a tree or behind a rock pile or wall). This is the number 
of herd animals trampling the exposed creature. Trampling 
causes either 1-4 hp oi damage {camel, cattle, antelope, and 
sheep' or 1-6 hp of damage {buffalo) per herd animal trampling. 

Habitat.Society: Herd animals graze on open terrain, migrating 
to a new territory when the food supply of the old has been de¬ 
pleted Herd size varies from a family of four buffalo to a com¬ 
mercial flock of 1 000 sheep. The largest and oldest male usually 
serves as the leader, directing the movement his herd and watch¬ 
ing for predators. Herd animals do not collect treasure. 


Ecology: Herd animals eat grass, grains, and shrubbery. They 
are the favored prey of carnivores, including Hons, tigers, and 
dragons. Man often domesticates herd animals for their meat, 
milk, fur (blankets and clothing), and skin (shoes and tents). 
Dried droppings of herd animals can be burned for fuel.

Most small mammals are harmless to humans. Some have useful 
traits or abilities. Most animals have only rudimentary languages 
that humanoids cannot use except with the aid of magical spells. 
All have THACO 20, except where noted below. 

Beavers quickly chew trees and construct homes in ponds. 
Adult pelts are worth two gp. 

House cats are smalt domesticated breeds, 

Chipmunks have excellent hearing and eyesight. 

Ermines are related to weasels. The white, spotted pelt is worth 
four gp. 

Ferrets are related to weasels. If captured as cubs or raised 
domestically ferrets may be trained to perform simple tricks, 
retrieve objects, or hunt small burrowing game. 

Foxes have superb vision, hearing, and noses. Their pelts are 
worth three to five gp. 

Gophers live in large colonies burrowed into the soil of the 
plains. They have acute senses of hearing and smell. For each 
gopher encountered, another IdlO are hiding in the burrows 
nearby. 

Hedgehogs are covered with sharp but harmless quills. 

Moles have an excellent ability to detect tastes and vibrations, 
but very poor vision. 


Monkey refers to a variety of small, non-hostile species 
(rhesus, spider, tamarind, lemurs, and others). THACO 19. 

Mice infest virtually any human structure.

1/000-4,000 gp, THACO 19 (sea and giant otters). 

Pigs may bite or attempt to stun, then crush a victim by 
butting. Domestic pigs are normally harmless unless angered or 
magically controlled. Wild pigs are domestic pigs that have 
escaped to the wild. They are smaller (2 feet long) and 
non aggressive unless provoked. THACO 19, 

Rabbits are difficult to surprise or catch due to their sensitive 
eyesight, hearing, nose, and natural paranoia. 

Raccoons only attack if cornered or rabid (10% chance). The 
pelts are worth one gp. 

Squirrels have good vision and hearing.

These horrors, sometimes called tlincaUis, are part human and 
part scorpion. A manscorpion has a dark-skinned human torso, 
its abdomen is protected by bony plates, and its ribs and back¬ 
bone protrude from the body. Their hands have two thick fingers 
and a long thumb; the hands are often mistaken for scorpion-like 
daws. The creatures are hairless, and their faces are handsome 
and noble, except for the red, glowing eyes which have no pupils. 

The creature's torso sits atop a 4-foot-long, bony-plated, 
arachnoid body which is supported by six legs. Bony plate com¬ 
pletely covers the strong legs. The protruding spine continues 
along the abdomen and forms a tail 10 feet long, The lower body, 
legs, and tail are usually sand-colored, and blend easily with the 
deserL Observers rarely see anything but the muscular human 
torso until the manscorpions are close. 

The origins of these creatures is thought to lie in an ancient 
curse placed on evil humans They speak their own language, 
and 20% also speak some locally spoken tongue. 

Combat: Most manscorpions have low to average intelligence; 
they patrol their territory in squads of six warriors. A squad 
leader and a spellcaster. each with 9 HD and greater intelligence, 
are also present. The spellcaster has the abilities of a 4th-leveJ 
cleric or mage. Fully 50% of them carry obsidian-studded clubs 
(treat as a battle axe) and bolas or javelins. The rest use only their 
natural weapons. 

When directed by the squad leader, manscorpions attack in an 
organized manner. They use long-range attacks before closing for 
melee. In dose combat, they attack with weapon, daw, and tail, 
or with tail and two claws. The tail can strike anywhere nearby, 
including in front of the creature. When not being used for at¬ 
tack, the tail sweeps the area behind the manscorpion, checking 
for obstacles and assailants. Anyone struck by the tail's spur 
must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die in 2d4 
rounds. Victims suffer weakness For one round (^2 attack penal¬ 


ty), start to shake in the next round (“3 attack penalty and no 
Dexterity bonus to AC), then convulse (AC 10 and no attacks 
possible) until they die. 

Common manscorpions lose organization and their morale is 
reduced without a leader, When morale is reduced to 1 or 2 hit 
points, common manscorpions go into a stinging frenzy, making 
two tail attacks per round, but no other attacks. 

Patrols are more common near the manscorpion lair, which is 
guarded by a swarm consisting of three squads. A swarm leader 
and a spellcaster, each with 10 Hit Dice, accompany a swarm. 
The spellcaster is the equivalent of a 7th-levei priest or wizard* 
These leaders stay out of combat, directing the action and casting 
spells. Swarms are sent on patrol in times of trouble. 

For every two swarms, there is a noble and a sorcerer. They 
stay near the lair unless an army of manscorpions is marching, 
then they will lead two swarms. These leaders have 11 HD, and 
sorcerers cast spells at 9th-level ability. 

Finally every lair has a king or queen, or both, with 12 Hit 
Dice* A high cleric, also with 12 HD, aids these rulers with the 
abilities of an llth-level priest. They always remain in the lair 
and wilt only fight if directly threatened. 

Habitat/Society: Manscorpions live under the desert sands in 
burrows connected by tunnels, all situated above underground 
cities of 40-400 individuals. These often mirror great human cit¬ 
ies. with pits instead of buildings, and great chasms like inverted 
pyramids* 

Manscorpions often hold humans and dwarves as slaves, using 
them to mine and create weaponry* A manscorpions fingers are 
not very dexterous, but they are fine sculptors with hammer and 
chisel, and many sculptures decorate their cities. 

Ecology: Manscorpions eat practically any meat, including carri¬ 
on. No normal creatures prey on them.

The manticore is a true monster, with a leonine torso and legs, 
bat I ike wings, a mans head, a tail tipped with iron spikes, and an 
appetite for human flesh. 

The manticore stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 
15 feet in length. It has a 25-foot wingspan. Each section of the 
manticore closely resembles the creature it imitates. The leonine 
torso has a tawny hide, the mane is a lion's brown-black color, 
and the batlike wings are a dark brow n with sparse hair. All man- 
ticores have heads that resemble human males; the mane resem¬ 
bles a heavy beard and long hair 

Combat; The manticore first fires a volley of 1-6 tail spikes (180 
yard range as a light crossbow'). Each spike causes 1-6 points of 
damage. The manticore can fire four such volleys each day (the 
spikes regrow quickly). Next, the manticore closes with its prey 
and attacks with its front claws and sharp teeth. In an outdoor 
setting, the manticore tries to stay in the air to minimize its 
chance of being attacked. It is a clumsy flier, however, and can¬ 
not use its teeth in the air. 

Habitat Society; Manticores are found in any climate but pre¬ 
fer warm lands to cool ones. This reflects the wide climate range 
of their favorite food, humans. A manticores territory may cov¬ 
er 20 or more square miles and includes at least one human settle¬ 
ment. Such territories usually overlap with those of other 
manticores and other man-eating predators like dragons, 

Manticores mate for life. The male remains with the female 
during gestation and hunts for her. Manticores bear one or two 
cubs which grow rapidly to adulthood in five years. Cubs are 
bom with 1 Hit Die and gain an additional one each year. In their 
first year, cubs lack flying ability but they are still small enough 
for an adult to grasp in its forelegs. There is a 20% chance a she- 
manticores lair holds cubs under one year old. Cubs up to two 
years inflict one point of damage per front paw and 1-2 points 
with their bite. Cubs 3-4 years old inflict 1-2, L-2, and 1-6 points 
of damage. 



Manticore cubs can be caught and trained to assist evil hu¬ 
mans. Such training is difficult and dangerous, especially since 
domesticated adults have an 80% chance of reverting to a wild 
state, Manticores will not allow themselves to be used as mounts. 
Wild adults may voluntarily ally themselves with evil humans, 
provided such allies can provide them with a steady ample food 
supply 

Manticores normally eat their prey where they kill it. Males 
sometimes haul slain prey back to their mates or drag still-living 
prey to their lairs for the cubs to practice killing. 

Manticores collect their victims* valuables for a variety of rea¬ 
sons, including curiosity emulation of other monsters who col¬ 
lect treasure, the man-scent on the things, or because they know 
humans value the things and therefore might come looking for 
them. Their lack of real hands prevents most manticores from 
using what magical items fall into their possession. However, 
manticores that have allied with evil humans may possess magi¬ 
cal items designed specifically for their use. Examples include 
magical collars or bracelets that are, m effect, oversized magical 
rings. 

Ecology; Manticores are wide-ranging carnivores that have 
successfully survived in every region inhabited by humans, 
whether in the wilderness or underground. They are nightmarish 
opponents but invaluable allies if conditions are right. A manti¬ 
cores pelt is a mark of the most powerful hunters and warriors. 
An intact, cured manticore hide complete with wings is worth 
10,000 gp,

Medusae are female humanoids with hair of swarming snakes. 
They are hateful creatures that can petrify any creature that 
meets their gaze. 

The typical medusa has a pale-skinned, very shapely woman's 
form. It stands 5 to 6 feet tall with the snakes adding up to an¬ 
other foot. At distances farther than 30 feet, the medusa is easily 
confused with a normal woman. Its red-glowing eyes are visible 
up to 30 feet. At distances of 20 feet or closer, the medusa's true 
nature is revealed. Its face is horrible—the snakes writhe con¬ 
stantly especially if the medusa is excited. 

Medusae wear human clothing such as loose dresses or robes. 
They seldom wear armor and cannot easily wear helmets. Medu¬ 
sae may carry a knife, dagger, or short bow. Medusae speak their 
own tongue and the common one. 

Combat: The medusa tries to get dose to a victim before it re¬ 
veals its true nature. It will use Its attractive body to kre males 
nearer while staying in the shadows. Once the medusa is within 
30 feet, it strikes, trying to get its victim to look into its eyes, Any 
creature within 30 feet must make a saving throw versus petrifi¬ 
cation or turn instantly to lifeless stone. If an opponent averts his 
eyes, the medusa rushes up so that its serpentine growths can at¬ 
tack, The range of such attacks is only 1 foot, but the victim must 
save versus poison or die. 

The medusa is able to see creatures in the Ethereal and Astral 
planes, and its petrifying gaze is equally as effective against crea¬ 
tures there. It retains its petrifying gaze after death. Creatures 
looking at a freshly-dead medusa's head make a saving throw at 
+ 1. The saving throw increases +1 each day the head decays. 

If the medusa cannot easily use its normal tactics, it may resort 
to normal weapons such as knives and shortbows. 

Habitat Society: Medusae dwell in dark caves or the lower re¬ 
gions of large abandoned buildings. They arrange the lighting 
such that their homes are filled with flickering shadows. 



The presence of petrified victims is a sure indicator of the occu¬ 
pant s true nature. For this, aesthetic, and other reasons, the me¬ 
dusa usually removes most of its victims. Those that resemble 
interesting statues maybe retained; the rest are often broken into 
unrecognizable (and unrevivable) chunks. 

The one form of treasure never found in a medusa's lair is a 
mirror If a medusa sees its own reflection in a mirror, it turns to 
stone itself. Reflection in nonmetallic reflectors such as water or 
polished stone have no such effect. Medusae arc immune to the 
petrifying effect of another medusa. 

Medusae are infrequently driven to mate with humanoid 
males. The act always ends in the male's death, usually by petrifi¬ 
cation when the medusa reveals its previously hidden visage. 
Two to six eggs are laid one month later and hatch eight months 
after that. The female hatchlings appear as baby girls with stub¬ 
by green tendrils. The hatchlings are revolting to look at but can¬ 
not petrify. Medusae grow at the same rate as humans. At about 
age two the serpentine hair becomes alive and gains its poisonous 
bite. The medusa can petrify with the onset of adolescence. 

Greater Medusa (Serpentine) 

Rare medusae {10% J have serpentine bodies in place of the lower 
torso and legs. The entire body is covered with fine scales and 
measures 10 to 20 feet. The poison of these medusae is so deadly 
that saving throws are made at -1, and they are known to use 
bows and poisoned arrows. Their blood is so poisonous, in fact, 
that even after one has been killed, touching its body still re¬ 
quires a saving throw versus poison. They seldom venture far 
from their lairs, since they are immediately recognizable. Greater 
medusae have a morale bonus of +1.

Maedar 

Maedar are male counterparts to medusae, though they lack the 
petrifying gaze of the females. 

The typical maedar is a muscular, hairless humanoid male, 
usually dressed in a kilt or tunic. 

Combat: Maedar attack with powerful fists that each cause 2d4 
points of damage. One every three turns, the maedar can turn 
stone to flesh by touch. Maedar can pass through stone at their 
normal movement rate. They require one round of concentration 
before this; no other activity can be undertaken that round, 
Maedar struck by a phase door spell while passing through stone 
are killed instantly 

Maedar are immune to petrifaction and paralyzation (includ¬ 
ing related spells, such as hold and s/om). They are immune to 
the poisonous bite of a medusa's serpentine hair. In addition, 
maedar can see into and extend their stone into flesh power into 
the Astral and Ethereal planes. 

Habitat/Society: Maedar are the little-known male version of the 
medusae. They are extremely rare, however (far more rare than 
the frequency would indicate), and few medusae ever find a 
maedar spouse. Most medusae typically mate with human males. 
This cross produces two to six eggs that hatch into fledgling, 
human-like females, who mature into medusae. The cross insures 
the continuation of the medusae species. 

When a medusa finds and mates with the extremely rare 
maedar the eggs hatch into human infants, 25% male and 75% 
female. Only 2% of the males bom of these matings are actually 
maedar; the remaining males and all the females are normal hu¬ 
man infants who die at the sight of their mother. 

The typical maedar is a monogamist who mates for life; he is 
fiercely devoted to his mate and will go to any length to assist or 
avenge her. A widowed maedar will pursue his mate's killer for 
years. 

Because of the Maedar's rarity and natural redusiveness, even 
most sages are unaware of their existence. Maedar are rarely 
seen; generally they remain in the lair they share with a medusa 



mate. A maedar's magical power provides food for him and his 
mate. He smashes her petrified victims, then transforms them in¬ 
to meat. 

Ecology; Maedar may cooperate with lawful evil creatures, 
such as kobolds and ores, in exchange for security or reward, Li 
forced to aid another creature, maedar seek revenge at the first 
opportunity. 

Glyptar 

Glyptars are rock crystals animated by the spirits of maedar. 
When a maedar has foreknowledge of his death, he can transfer his 
life force into the rocks. An extremely evil maedar retains his con¬ 
sciousness as it drifts through the ground. When such a life force 
encounters gemstones, such as feldspar or amethyst, it is trapped 
within and cannot leave voluntarily. Eventually the maedar goes 
mad, (Note that once a maedar is trapped within a glyptar crystal, 
his life force cannot be trapped in a second crystal.) 

If this glyptar is removed intact from the ground, the maedar's 
spirit is now able to animate the crystal and anything inorganic 
attached to it. Thus if the glyptar is set in the eye of a stone 
statue, the maedar's life force animates It as a golem. This can 
affect a maximum of 1,000 pounds. 

Similarly, it the glyptar is set in the pommel of a sword, the 
sword can be animated to strike as though it were wielded by the 
living maedar. The weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, 
strikes as if it were wielded by a bthdevel fighter, and gains a +2 
bonus to its damage roll. Note that the glyptars sfpne to fiesh 
power enables the weapon to sink harmlessly into stone as the 
glyptar uses its power. 

The glyptar retains its other powers as well. The glyptar and 
its attachments may pass through stone at will at the normal 
movement rate. It is immune to phase door spells. Once every 
three turns the glyptar can perform a stone to flesh attack against 
a target touched by the glyptar or its setting. Glyptars remain 
immune to paralyzation and petrification attacks of all sorts.

Mermen are marine-dwelling. amphibious humanoids with the 
upper torso of a human and the lower torso of a fish. 

Mermen were once human but were transformed by unknown 
powers into their current forms. They live by herding fish, but 
during times of need they attack other sea-peoples or ocean¬ 
going vessels. They live underwater but surface to sun them¬ 
selves on large rocks. 

Adult mermen are 5 to 6 feet long (tall) and weigh between 150 
and 225 pounds. Their skin tone is fair to tan, hair color is usu¬ 
ally dark brown (occasionally fair), while their scale color ranges 
from green to silver, Females, also known as mermaids, are 6 
inches shorter than the males and weigh between 100 to 150 
pounds. Mermen adorn themselves with coral and shell decora¬ 
tions. Mermen speak their own language (with different dialects 
spoken by communities that are separated over wide distances), 
and 50% of all communities also speak locathah. 

Combat: Mermen communities are well-armed. The arms used 
by mermen are as follows; 

Trident, dagger (50%) * 

Crossbow, dagger (30%) 

Javelin, dagger (20%) 

* 20% of all trident wielders are also armed with a hook and 
grappling line (50 feet long). 

Mermen crossbows have a range of 30 yards underwater. They 
use grapples to attack ships; the grapples can be thrown up to 50 
teeL Each grapple held by 10 mermen slows a ship by 1. Once 
stopped, the ship is attacked and a hole is knocked in its hull in 
4d4 rounds, after which the ship slowly sinks, to be looted by the 
mermen. 

Merman suffer double damage from fire attacks. 



Habitat/Society: For every 20 mermen encountered, there is a 
patrol leader (2-3 HD) and 1-3 barracuda (AC 6; Move 30; HD 3; 
#AT 1; Dmg2d4). For every 40 mermen, there is a leader (4 HD). 
For every 120 mermen encountered, there is one chief (6 HD i and 
two guards (4 HD). For every ten mermen, there is a 10% chance 
of a shaman (3 HD, with the spells of a 3rd-level priest). 

Mermen have regular undersea communities, usually a reef or 
cliff honeycombed with passages. Rarely (10% of the time) they 
construct a village from sea shells and coral. An average commu¬ 
nity has between 100 and 600 males. Females and sub-adults each 
equal 100% of the males in a village. The communities are usu¬ 
ally guarded by 3d6 trained barracudas. 

Mermen society is heavily patriarchal. They prefer to be left to 
themselves and usually reject proposals of friendship or trade. 
They have strong territorial instincts and, while closely related to 
humans, they have no love for them. Males hunt and herd fish 
and protect their territory. Females raise children and tend to do¬ 
mestic affairs. Mermaids aie also known for their creativity, and 
they produce works of art for the community (shell carvings, sea¬ 
weed tapestries, and songs). 

Ecology: Mermen are omnivorous, but they prefer a diet of 
fish, lobster, crab, and shellfish. They do not cook these crea¬ 
tures, but must fillet them before eating. They can survive out of 
water for one hour before they begin to dehydrate. When dehy¬ 
drated, they lose 2 hit points per hour and will die when they 
reach 2ero; immersion in fresh or salt water immediately restores 
these lost hit points. 

Mermen have an average life expectancy of 150 years. Mermen 
have many natural enemies but particularly hate the sahuagin 
and ixitxachitl. They often dash with tritons over territory.

Mimics are magically-created creatures with a hard rock-like 
outer shell that protects their soft inner organs. Mimics can alter 
their form and their pigmentation; they use this talent to lure vic¬ 
tims into close range, where they attempt to feed on them. They 
usually appear in the form of treasure chests. There are two vari¬ 
eties. the smaller, more intelligent common mimic, and the larg¬ 
er, less intelligent killer mimic. 

Mimics are large. Common mimics occupy about 150 cubic 
feet (a 3' x 6' x 8' chest, or a large door frame). Killer mimics 
occupy about 200 cubic feet. Mimics' natural color is a speckled 
grey that resembles granite. Mimics can alter their pigmentation 
to resemble varieties of stone (such as marble!, wood grain, and 
various metals (gold, silver, copper); it takes one round to make 
the desired alteration. They cannot lose mass in this transforma- 
tion (they must remain the same size, though they may radically 
alter their dimensions). 

Common mimics have their own tongue (corruptions of the 
original language spoken by their wizard creators) and can also 
be taught to speak in common and other languages. Killer mimics 
are incapable of speech. 

Combat; A mimic can surprise its victims easily (-4 penalty to 
victims' surprise rolls). When a creature touches a mimic, it lash¬ 
es out with a pseudctpod that inflicts 3d4 points of damage. Fur¬ 
thermore. the mimic covers itself with a glue-like substance. Any 
creature or item that touches a mimic is held fast. Alcohol will 
weaken the glue in three rounds, enabling the character to break 
free, or the character may attempt to make an open doors roll to 
break free. Only one attempt may be made per character, and no 
other action, offensive or defensive, may be performed during 
the round that the attempt is being made. A mimic may neutral¬ 
ize its glue at any time that it desires; the glue dissolves five 
rounds after the mimic dies. The mimic is immune to add attacks 
and is unaffected by molds, green slime, and various puddings. 



Habitat Society; Mimics live underground, where they can 
avoid sunlight. They are solitary creatures; this is to ensure that 
each mimic has a large grazing area. They have no culture: their 
primary concerns are survival and food. Common mimics are 
quite intelligent and will gladly offer information in exchange for 
food. Killer mimics attack regardless of attempts at communica¬ 
tion. Mimics have no moral code and no interest in culture or 
religion. Wizards who use them as guardians have sometimes 
found them to be less than enthusiastic about obeying their com¬ 
mands. 

Ecology: Mimics were originally created by wizards to protect 
themselves from treasure hunters. A good meaJ (one or two hu¬ 
mans) can sustain them for weeks. They reproduce by fission and 
grow to full size in several years. Mimics pose as stonework, 
doors, statues, stairs, chests, or other common items made from 
stone, wood, and metal. Their skin is covered with optical sen¬ 
sors that are sensitive to heat and light in a QD-tool radius, even in 
pitch darkness. Any powerful light source can easily blind them, 
including direct sunlight. Along with glue, they can excrete a liq¬ 
uid that smells like rotting meat; this attracts smaller, more com¬ 
mon prey (usually rats). Mimic ichor is useful in the creation of 
polymorph self potions, and their glue and solvent sacs can be 
sold to alchemists. Other internal organs are useful in the manu¬ 
facture of perfumes. The mimics internal organs are considered 
tasty delicacies in some cultures.

The illithid. or mind flayer, is an evil and Feared creature of the Under- 
dark; its powers are formidable and it feeds on the brains of any creature 
it encounters. Using arcane powers, it enslaves or destroys its foes, which 
include such powerful creatures as drow and kuo-toa. 

Mind Flayers stand about 6 Feet fall and have hideous mauve skin that 
glistens with slime. The head resembles an octopus, with white eyes [no 
pupits are evident) and four tentacles around its mouth, a round, many- 
toothed orifice like that of a lamprey. The creature has three reddish fin¬ 
gers and a thumb on each hand. 

flliih ids have infra vision. They can communicate with any creatures 
via innate telepathy: they have no spoken language, although they often 
accompany their thoughts with hissing, and the eager lashing of trheir ten¬ 
tacles. Mind flayers dress in Flowing robes, often with high, stiff collars, 
adorned with symbols of death and despair, 

Combat A mind flayers preferred method of attack is the tnitjrf blast, pro¬ 
jected in a cane 60 feet long, 5 fee! wide at the mind (layer, and 20 feet wide at 
the opposite end. All withm the cone must make a saving throw vs. wands or 
be stunned and unable to act for 3d4 rounds. The iUithid tries to grab one or 
two stunned victim* (requiring normal attack rolls if others by to prevent 
this) and escape with them. 

The illithid keeps some victims as slaves and feeds on the brains of the 
others. When devouring the brain of a stunned victim, it inserts its tenta¬ 
cles into the victim s skull and draws out its brain, killing the victim in 
one round, A mind flayer can also use its tentacles in combat; it does so 
only when surprised or when attacking a single, unarmed victim, A ten¬ 
tacle which hits causes 2 hp damage and holds the victim. A tentacle does 
no damage while holding, and can be removed with a successful bend 
bars lifi gates roll. Once all four tentacles have attached to the Victim, 
the mind flayer has found a path to the brain and kills the victim in one 
round. If preferred, the DM can simply roil 1d4 for the number of rounds 
required to kill a struggling victim, 

A mind flayer can also use the following arcane powers, one per 
round, as a 7tb-level mage: suggestion, charm person charm monster, 
ESP levitate , astral projection, and plane shift. All saving throws against 
these powers are made al a *4. due to the creatures mental prowess 

If an encounter is going against a mind flayer it will immediately flee, 
seeking to save itself regardless of its treasure or its fellows 

Habitat Society; Mind flayers hate sunlight and avoid it when possible. 
They live in underground cities of 200 to 2,000 illithids* plus at least two 
slaves per i]]fthjd. All the slaves are under the effects of a charm person or 
charm monstar, and obey their illithid masters without question. 

The center of a community is its elder-brain, a pool of briny fluid that 
contains the brains of the city's dead mind flayers. Due to the mental 
powers of dlithids the elder-brain b still sentient, and the telepathic un¬ 
ion of its brains rules the community. The elder-brain has a telepathic 
range of 2 to 5 miles, depending emits age and size* It does not attack, but 
telepathically warns the mmd flayers of the presence of thinking crea¬ 



tures so a mind flayer within its telepathic radius can be surprised only 
by nonrintelligent creatures The range of the elder-brain determines the 
territory claimed and defended by the community though raiding parties 
are sent far beyond this limit* 

Mind fiayeTs have no family structure. Their social activities include eat¬ 
ing. communicating with the elder-bra in, and debating on the best tactics to 
conquer the Underdark. For amusement, they inflict pain on their captives 
and force slaves to fight in gladiatorial game 

Mind ttayer&amp; are arrogant, viewing all other species only as cattle to be 
fed upon. They prefer to eat the brains of thinking creatures, 

Ecolugy: Mind flayers live about 125 years They are warm-blooded am¬ 
phibians. and spend the first 10 years of life as tadpoles, swimming In the 
elder-brain pool until they either die (which most do) or grow into adult 
illithids On an irregular basis, adult illithids feed brains to the tadpoles, 
which do not molest the elder-brain, Illithids are hermaphroditic; each 
can produce one tadpole twice in its life. 

Mind flayer ichor is an effective ingredient in a potion of ESP. 

Psionic Illithids 

Psionic flayers, considered the only true illithids by some (including 
themselves), have most of the same statistics and abilities as other mind 
flayers. Instead of magic-based abilities, however, theirs are purely psi¬ 
onic. Psionic mind Flayers have a beak-like mouth and disdain the stiff* 
collared robes preferred by their cousins, 

Psionics Summary:

Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of mmo~ 
taurs and humans. They usually dwell Ln underground laby¬ 
rinths, for they are not confused in these places, which gives 
them an advantage over their prey, 

Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and 
muscular. They have the head of a bull but the body of a human 
male. Their fur is brown to black while their body coloring varies 
as would a normal human's* Clothing is minima!, usually a loin 
doth or skirt. 


Combat: Minotaurs are very strong (equivalent human 
Strength of 18). Against man-sized opponents (minimum 6 feet 
tall) they may butt for 2-8 points of damage. Against smaller op¬ 
ponents, they bite for 1-4 points of damage. If a minotaur Is 30 
feet or more from its opponent, it can lower its head and charge 
against any creature that is at least 6 feet tall. II successful, the 
charge causes double head-butt damage. In addition to these at¬ 
tacks, most minotaurs also carry weapons—a huge axe (treat as a 
halberd) or flail, with which it inflicts normal damage +2. 

Minotaurs are not particularly intelligent, but are extremely 
cunning and have excellent senses. They have a +2 bonus on 
their surprise rolls, have infra vision, and can track prey by scent 
like a ranger* with 50% accuracy. They always pursue an unfa¬ 
miliar scent. Minotaurs are immune to maze spells. They attack 
any intruder without fear, and will retreat only if the creature is 
obviously beyond their ability to defeat (+3 to morale score in 
combat). 

Habitatsodety: Minotaurs live in communities of up to eight 
members. If the community contains more than six minotaurs, 
one will be an elder minotaur with 18^50 Strength and 8 + 4 Hit 
Dice. The minotaur elder is the clan leader ; he remains in the cen¬ 
ter of the labyrinth and raises young minotaurs while others 
hunt. He is always encountered in the center of a labyrinth. 

A minotaurs labyrinth is rarely natural. Often an evil wizard 
or a tyrant will construct a labyrinth and place the minotaur fam¬ 



ily there, feeding it prisoners and slaves on a regular basis. 

Occasionally this tyrant will be killed and the minotaurs 
forced to fend for themselves; since creatures rarely enter a laby¬ 
rinth on their own accord, these minotaurs will usually be raven¬ 
ously hungry, 

Minotaurs speak their own primitive language and are 25% 
likely to speak a halting form of common. They have little cul¬ 
ture; their lives resemble animals more than humans. Their cul¬ 
ture venerates physical strength above all else and particularly 
strong human fighters have been known to earn their respect. 
They worship crude gods and have weak clerics (maximum 3rd- 
level shaman). Rumors persist of more intelligent minotaurs with 
developed societies. 

Ecology: The curse which creates minotaurs is unknown* but 
sages suspect it involves "crimes against the natural order*" Mino¬ 
taurs are always male. It is also said that the first minotaur was 
originally a great and ill-tempered human fighter; he wanted to 
be as strong as a bull and his wish was granted in the most hid¬ 
eous manner possible, Minotaurs breed with human females to 
produce offspring, which are male minotaurs. Minotaurs have a 
lifespan of 200 years, They can live without food for years at a 
lime, but are always hungry unless they are fed regularly. They 
are meat-eaters, but their curse causes them to prefer a diet of 
human flesh. Those transformed into minotaurs by curses may 
be restored to human form by a unsh, but those who were bom 
as minotaurs cannot be made human. Gnolls are their natural 
enemies; they will kill each other on sight* 

Minotaur components are sometimes used in spells and po¬ 
tions, and might be used in magical items involving strength* lo¬ 
cation* and misdirection.

The crimson death is a malevolent, vaporous creature that feeds 
on the bodily fluids of its victims. 

The body of the crimson death is a humanoid-shaped cloud of 
pale color. It is difficult to distinguish if seen against fog and 
nearly invisible to tnf ravision. During this time, the creature has 
an initiative bonus of + 4. When the creature is fed, it develops a 
crimson flush that is easily visible by normal or infra vision. The 
cloud possesses humanoid features The fingers elongate into ten¬ 
tacles when it is feeding. Because of its behavior, sages believe 
that a Crimson Death Mist is the result of the actual death of a 
vampire. 

The crimson deaths language is a barely audible series of whis¬ 
pers. It can communicate with other vaporous beings such as air 
elemental^. It communicates with humanoids only if it is their 
captive. 

Combat: The monster attacks only to feed or defend itself. It 
surrounds its victim with vaporous tentacles. Whenever it hits 
the tentacles drain bodily fluids and cause 3dlQ points of dam¬ 
age. 

The creature is normally immaterial (AC 0) and can be struck 
only by magical weapons of + 2 or better. After feeding, the crea¬ 
ture attains solidity (AC 4) for six turns. At this time the creature 
turns red, moves more slowly (FI 6), and can be struck by magi¬ 
cal weapons of +1 or better. 

When a crimson death dies, it immediately dissipates into the 
air while its undigested fluids fall to the ground in a grotesque 
shower. 

The crimson death is able to carry loads by levitating anything 
surrounded by its vaporous mass. Despite its vaporous nature 
the crimson death possesses strength equal to a normal human. It 
is able to carry a passive weight equal to an adult human. If it 
attempts to pick up a struggling victim, it must make a successful 
attack roll for each round it carries the person. Failure means the 
person drops to the ground (suffering damage appropriate to the 
height of the fall}. 

Habitat.Society: The crimson death dwells in the bogs and 
marshes where chill and damp prevail. The creature is nearly in¬ 
visible in its native habitat. 

The crimson death is a secretive creature, It prefers to feed on 
solitary beings, since these are easy lo sneak up on and have no 



allies to lend them support. If several people are present, the 
crimson death tries to pick off the guard while the others sleep; it 
then feeds on the others at its leisure. In order to conceal Its pres¬ 
ence, the crimson death disposes of corpses in its lair or a deep 
bog. 

It maintains a lair in a thicket, undercut bank, or a hollow 
space under a windfall. There the monster stores the valuables it 
collects from its victims. These can be used as bribes for human¬ 
oid allies or bait for intended victims. The lair may also contain 
the remains of past victims. 

The crimson death prefers to feed on humanoids. It normally 
requires one victim per week. If more people are available, the 
monster may feed continuously until destroyed or driven off. 

Legends tell of a connection between crimson deaths and vam¬ 
pires. One tale suggests that, when an undead vampire is de¬ 
stroyed, its spirit is transformed into a crimson death. Another 
tale suggests that, when a vampire is created, the monsters lost 
soul is reborn elsewhere as a crimson death. This legend also sug¬ 
gests that a vampire may be restored to normal lif e it it is rejoined 
by its crimson death counterpart. A third legend says that ex¬ 
tremely evil air elemental are condemned and cast out into the 
Prime Material plane in the forms of crimson deaths. 

Ecology: The crimson death is a dangerous predator that roams 
the swamps like a living ghost. A crimson death can be collected 
and imprisoned in an airtight container. This does not harm it. A 
crimson death in such a container may be mistaken for, or mis¬ 
labeled as, a bottled djtnn or magical vapor. If someone releases 
the crimson death- the starving creature immediately attacks its 
unwitting rescuer. 

Crimson deaths are aware of the advantages of alliances. They 
may agree to cooperate with evil humanoids who can provide 
them with a steady supply of victims. They make excellent allies 
for those dwelling in or near their lairs.

These gaseous monsters prey on all living creatures, enveloping 
them with their gaseous tendrils, then draining their blood far 
food. 

Vampiric mists appear as thick, billowing clouds, 5 to 8 feet in 
diameter. Color ranges from pale pink when hungry to crimson 
red when sated, Vampiric mists speak no language, but they com¬ 
municate through a limited form of telepathy. These creatures 
reek of old blood and are often smelled before seen. 

Combat: Vampiric mists automatically sense the presence ot 
any warm-blooded creature within 50 feet. Hungry mists take the 
shortest route possible to the victim, navigating by touch, flow¬ 
ing easily over water or through narrow cracks. Their path can 
be blocked by nonporous obstacles, but vampiric mists are intel¬ 
ligent and if any reasonable path exists they will find it. 

All vampiric mists have maximum hit points (8 per die) when 
full, but they are almost never encountered in this state. For each 
12 hours a mist goes unfed, it loses 1 hit point. Vampiric mists 
whose hit point totals reach 0 due to starvation die. To regain hit 
points vampiric mists must drain fresh blood from living victims 
(hence the mists name). For each 2 hit points of blood drained, 
the mist regains 1 hit point. 

A vampiric mist may attack one victim per round by reaching 
out with a gaseous tendril. Targets of a vampiric mist are treated 
as AC 10. Modify this number by the victim's Dexterity, and by 
the magical protection worn (+ 1 ( +2, etc.) but ignore magical 
shields. The touch of a vampiric mist drains ld8 points of blood. 
A hit 4 above the needed to hit number means the mist has envel¬ 
oped its victim. Enveloped victims are automatically hit each 
round until either the mist dies, finishes feeding, or retreats. At¬ 
tacks by other characters against an enveloping vampiric mist di¬ 
vide their damage evenly—half against the mist, half against the 
victim. Only the enveloped victim may attack the mist without 
harm to himself. However, because of the disorienting effect of 
rapid blood lass, enveloped victims may not use any spells or 
magical devices that require concentration. 

While blood draining is mainly used to teed, the ability can 
also be used in defense by sated vampiric mists. Extra blood is 
simply dumped upon the ground. 

Normally, a v ampiric mist is damaged only by magical weapons 
or by spells that effect air. Lightning bolt and magic missile are also 
effective. However, immediately after reaching maximum hit 
points a vampiric mist takes on substance. This substantial stage 
last ld6 turns. During this time the mists movement rate slows 



to 6, its AC drops to B, and it may be hit by normal weapons. 

Blood draining is not a form of regeneration; a mist that loses 
hit points in combat must heal those points normally. Keep track 
of a mist s current hit points and its maximum possible for that 
combat (this total starts at 24 and goes down with damage caused 
to the mist). Each time the mist is wounded, reduce both the cur¬ 
rent hit points and the maximum. If the current hit point total 
ever reaches 0. the mist dies. Hit points gained by draining blood 
are added to the current hit points, which cannot exceed the max¬ 
imum total (24 minus damage to the mist). Hit points lost due to 
starvation are subtracted trom the current hit points only. The 
current hit points may never exceed the mist s maximum hit point 
total. (After the current battle is over, the maximum hit point 
totals tor any surviving mists return to 24.) 

HabitatSodety: These dread monsters inhabit both swamps, 
where they creep along mixing in with morning and night tog, 
and subterranean caverns, where they stalk prey in absolute 
darkness. Vampiric mists attack at night or early morning, flow¬ 
ing over the ground in search of warm-blooded victims. They 
prefer lone victims, bul hungry mists sometimes raid towns at 
night , slaying livestock and draining vict ims in their sleep, before 
slipping out at dawn. 

Ecology: First thought to be immature forms of crimson death, 
it is now known that these fiends were deliberately created by a 
powerful vampire wizard. 

Vampiric mists reproduce via division, A mist is 10% likely to 
divide during its substantial stage immediately after feeding. The 
two mists created have 3 Hit Dice each, but only 4 hit points per 
die (thus they are born ravenously hungry). 

Vampiric mists prey on all warm-blooded creatures. No ani¬ 
mals hunt vampiric mist deliberately, though stirges, leeches, and 
other bloodsuckers are sometimes drawn (fatally! to their smell. 
Vampiric mists have no known life span. They live until they 
starve, are slain, or reproduce.

Molds are a variety of spore-producing iungi that form in decay¬ 
ing food or in warm, moist places. These fungi usually have a 
woolly or furry texture. While most molds are harmless, there 
are (at leasts three varieties of monstrous molds that pose a dead¬ 
ly threat to adventurers: brown, russet, and yellow mold. 

Brown Mold 

Brown mold is found in damp subterranean areas, such as ca¬ 
verns and caves. It is Jight to golden brown in color. Brown mold 
feeds by absorbing heat, even body heat; where brown mold 
grows, the temperature is below average. Direct sunlight or ul¬ 
tra violet light kills it. 

If a warm-blooded creature comes within 5 feet of a brown 
mold, the mold drains heat equal to 4d8 points of damage from 
its victim, per round, A ring of warmth provides complete pro¬ 
tection against this attack. Brown mold grows instantly from 
heat. If a torch is used in its vicinity, it doubles in size; it flaming 
oil is used, it quadruples, and fireball-type spells cause it to grow 
eight-fold. 

Brown mold is not Fed by cold light sources (e.g., %/rf, faerie 
fire). The only magic that affects it are disintegrate (which de¬ 
stroys it), plant-affecting magic, and cold spells. Ice storms or 
walls of ice cause it to go dormant for 5d6 turns. A cold wand , 
white dragon breath, or a cone of cold kills it. Brown mold does 
not affect cold-using creatures such as white dragons, winter 
wolves, ice toads, etc. 

Russet Mold 

Russet mold is golden-brown to rust red in color. It has a lumpy 
texture similar to cold porridge, it is covered by short, hair-like 
growths that stand upright and wave as if they were in a cold 
breeze. It resembles rust at distances beyond 30 feet (70% chance 
of error). It is immune to weapons and most spells; it is affected 
only by alcohol, acid, and salt, which kill it: a cure disease or a 
continual light spell also destroys it. 

Russet mold continuously emits a cloud of spores in a three- 
foot radius. All creatures in this cloud suffer 5d4 points of dam¬ 
age (per round in the cloud) and must roll a successful saving 
throw vs. poison or become infected with spore sickness Victim* 
of spore sickness are instantly paralyzed and die in 5d4 minutes 
unless a cure disease spell is cast on them. 



Anyone who dies from spore sickness undergoes a transforma¬ 
tion and begins to sprout russet mold growths; when completely 
covered in mold &lt;ld4 + 20 hours), he becomes a mold man or ve- 
gepygmy, A hold plant spell will halt the growth of the mold for 
the duration of the spelJ. while a cure disease spell destroys it 
within an hour after death- after that, a wish is necessary to de¬ 
stroy it. 

Yellow Mold 

This mold is pale yellow to golden orange in color. It touched 
roughly, it may (50% chance) emit a cioud of spores in a 10-foot 
radius. Any creature caught in this cloud must roll a successful 
saving throw vs, poison or die A cure disease spell and a resur¬ 
rection spell within 24 hours are necessary to restore life. 

Fire of any sort destroys yellow mold. A continual light spell 
renders it dormant for 2d6 turns. 

Yellow mold colonies of over 300 square feet are sometimes 
sentient (1 in 6 chance). These molds sense creatures within 60 
feet, and may project their spores that distance. Twice per day, 
they may use a suggestion on someone within that radius; in ad¬ 
dition to the saving throw r the victim must successfully roil an 
Intelligence check or lose 1 point of Intelligence permanently (it is 
devoured by the mold) ,

Mold men* sometimes derogatorify called vegepygmies or even 
moldies, are short, bipedal fungus creatures. They have sharp, 
thorn-like daws, and leaf-like tendrils form a fringe on their 
shoulders, abdomens, and limbs. A topknot of these tendrils sits 
at the apex of a vegepygmy s head. 

The coloration of mold men matches their surroundings; forest 
mold men have brown skin and green tendrils, while those found 
underground might have gray skin and black tendrils. Mold men 
are lVi feet tall, plus 1/2-foot per Hit Die, 

Although they do not have a spoken language, vegepygmies 
are capable of vocalized cries. They normally communicate by 
tapping on their chests and on trees or stones. 

Combat; Parties of mold men hunt near their lairs. In their home 
territory, mold men blend into their surroundings, so opponents 
receive a ~2 penalty to surprise rolls. 

Mold men will attack any form of animal Me for food. Though 
capable of using their natural camouflage for ambush, they sel¬ 
dom use other tricks or traps, preferring direct assault. 

Half of the mold men in a group have I HD. while 25% have 2 
HD, The rest are 3 or 4 HD (equal chances). For every 50 mold 
men, there is a subchief with 5 HD and ld4 +1 bodyguards with 3 
HD each. Each tribe of mold men is led by a chief with 6 HD and 
2d4 bodyguards with 4 HD each. 

Half of the mold men encountered carry spears, while the oth¬ 
ers use dubs or go without weapons (equal chances). 

Chiefs aho attack with spores; victims must make a saving 
throw vs. poison or be paralyzed, dying in 5d4 minutes unless 
treated by a cure disease spell. Victims who die in this manner are 
reborn ld4 + 20 hours later as mold men with 4 HD. These indi¬ 
viduals generally become the chiefs bodyguards. 



Attacks from piercing weapons cause only i point of damage 
to mold men. They are immune to electrical attacks, as well as all 
charm spells except those which affect plants. Mold men always 
receive saving throws vs. enchantments, even if one is not nor¬ 
mally allowed. 

About half of all of their hunting parties are accompanied by a 
pack of thornies as well. Mold men settlements always hold 1-4 
packs of thornies (see thorny, under Plant, Dangerous). 

Habitat/Society: Mold men form primitive, settled tribes. Their 
lairs are usually found in warm underground areas, though some 
tribes have lairs in the underbrush of deep, dark forests and jun¬ 
gles. Tribes are very territorial. 

Mold men co-exist well with plant and fungus life. They often 
use shriekers to guard their lairs, and mold men native to the lair 
can pass by those shriekers unnoticed. Russet mold is usually 
found in the vicinity of a mold man lair as weJL 

New mold men are created by russet mold, by their leaders' 
spore attacks, or by budding. The latter occurs only if food is 
plentiful. Russet molds produce 5 HD mold men. while leaders 
create 4 HD mold men, and normal budding produces I HD 
mold men. 

Mold men have been known to associate with my con ids, 
which view them as rustic cousins. 

Ecology: Mold men live by scavenging and hunting. They will 
eat meat in any condition, from fresh to carrion. In rimes of great 
need, they have been known to eat other mold men. or even my- 
conids, though they seldom attack members of their own or an 
allied tribe.

Mongrel men are a mixture of the blood of many species: h u¬ 
mans, ores, gnolte, ogres, dwarves, hobgoblins, elves, bugbears, 
bullywugs, and many others. Their appearance varies greatly, 
combining the worst features of their parent stocks. They are 
usually dad in dirty rags: they are ashamed of their appearance 
and try keep their bodies concealed, especially among strangers. 
They have no distinct tongue of their own. but speak a debased 
common, mixed with grunts, whistles, growls, and gestures. 
Their names often mimic animal noises. 

Combat: Mongrelmen have three special abilities that help 
them to survive: mimicry pickpocketing, and camouflage. 

Mimicry enables them lo imitate the sounds made by any mon¬ 
ster or creature they have encountered except for special attack 
forms (groaning spirits' death wail, for instance), which they can¬ 
not imitate. 

Pickpocketing enables them to acquire items that they could 
not otherwise obtain (they have a 70% chance of successL 

Camouflage enables them to hide themselves and their items 
with great skill. The base chance of being unnoticed is 80%, and 
it requires one turn for camouflage to be performed. Each addi¬ 
tional turn spent preparing the camouflage increases the chance 
by 1 %, to a maximum of 95% (after 16 turns). Successfully cam¬ 
ouflaged persons or items are not noticed unless they are moved 
or touched (or move themselves, in the case of creatures). Cam¬ 
ouflaged buildings are usually unnoticeable or unrecognizable at 
ranges greater than 50 feet (this varies with size and type of struc¬ 
ture), 

Mongrelmen normally fight with dubs and swords, but 5% of 
the members of any group encountered are armed with blowguns 
and poison or paralyzing darts. 

Habitat Society: For every 10 mongrelmen encountered, there 
is at least one with 2 Hit Dice; lor every 30, there is one with 3 Hit 
Dice: and for every 40, there is one with 4 Hit Dice. In a com¬ 



munity where they are not held as thralls, there are usually a 
leader (AC 4, Move 12, HD 5, Dmg ldl2, +1 bonus to attack 
roll) and five bodyguards (HD 4). 

Because of their appearance, mongrelmen are seldom welcome 
in any lawful or good society, and are usually enslaved or abused 
by evil or chaotic groups. Thus mongrelmen are found as either 
slaves or serfs, working long hours for evil humans or human¬ 
oids in a dismal community, or as refugees living in abandoned 
ruins. Enslaved mongrelmen are not willing to rebeL but wait pa¬ 
tiently for their masters to be destroyed by outside forces. They 
prefer to live an orderly day-to-day existence. 

A mongrelman prides itself in the ability to survive: they con¬ 
sider the title "The Survivor" to be more esteemed than "The 
Great." For them, patience is a greater virtue than being good at 
the arts of war A mongrelman performs acts at violence only in 
self-defense or (in the case of slaves) on the orders of their mas¬ 
ters; free mongrelmen do not hesitate to kill anyone they believe 
threatens their community. They prefer to avoid contact with 
other creatures except in times of great need, when they try to 
steal what they require (food, took, etc.). 

Free mongrelmen raise domestic game and grow fruits and veg¬ 
etables, They have a long tradition of art, music, and literature. 
Their songs are a bizarre cacophony of animal songs mixed with 
mournful dirges and wails: a few sages consider them to be beau¬ 
tiful, but most disagree. 

Ecology: Mongrelmen are omnivorous, but their teeth are most 
efficient at eating meat. The life span of a free mongrelman is 
between 25 and 35 years; the average slave lives only 15 to 20 
years, Their infant mortality rate is very high. Their major ene¬ 
mies are tribes of wandering humanoids that hunt them for sport.

Of all the creatures that inhabit the deep, only the fcraken exceeds 
the morkoth in malice and cruelty. Also known as the ‘wraith o! 
the deep", the morkoth lurks in tunnels hoping to lure its victims 
into a trap from which they cannot escape. 

The descriptions given by those who have encountered 
morkoths contain considerable variation, so no one is certain 
what they really look like. They are usually said to resemble an 
intelligent fish with an octopus's beak. They are most frequently 
described as being between 5 to 6 feet long, inky black in color, 
with faint luminescent silver patches. They may have tins for 
arms and legs that vaguely resemble those of humans, and a 
number of fins tor navigation and propulsion in the depths, 
Morkoths have infravision with a 90-foot range. They speak 
their own language. 


Combat: A morkoth attacks by snapping with its squid-like 
beak, which inflicts IdlO points of damage. A morkoth lives at 
the center of six spiraling tunnels, each of which leads to a central 
chamber. These tunnels are narrow (only one size M creature 
may enter at a time, and no size U. As a victim passes over a 
tunnel, he is drawn in by a hypnotic pattern, which leads him 
toward the central chamber. As the victim is drawn into the cen¬ 
tral chamber he approaches the morkoth without realizing it and 
must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty or 
be charmed. A charmed victim is devoured at the morkoths lei¬ 
sure, If the morkoth doesn't charm the victim before he comes 
within 60 feet, the hypnotic effect of the tunnels is broken. 

A morkoth is highly resistant to magic. It reflects any spell that 
is cast at it back to the caster, including spells with an area of 
effect. If a dispel magic is simultaneously cast with a spell, there 
is a 50% chance the morkoth will be unable to reflect it, though it 
is entitled to a saving throw vs. the dispel, 

Habitat/Society: Morkoths are normally solitary creatures. 
They sometimes make alliances with kraken, offering their help 
in exchange for an occasional slave. If approached by evil sea 
humanoids for assistance, morkoths may strike a bargain but of¬ 
ten betray their ' allies ' at the most opportune moment, 



Morkoths rarely leave their tunnels. The tunnels are originally 
natural, but are slowly carved over the course of centuries by the 
morkoths so that the central chamber grows larger. Morkoths 
sometimes build their tunnels near hot air vents, so the water in 
morkoth lairs may be warmer than normal. 

Morkoths realize that other intelligent creatures like treasure, 
so they collect belongings from the creatures they kill to use in 
bargaining with other creatures. They place no value on gold or 
gems or even magical items. Morkoths enjoy deception above all 
else. They do not enslave their victims, if only because their ap¬ 
petites are so fierce that slaves would not survive long. 

Ecology; According to the most popular theories, morkoths are 
a species of fish with human and squid influences. Sages are un¬ 
sure if this species occurred by chance or design, Morkoths are 
carnivorous and will eat nearly any sea creature. Their usual diet 
is deep-water creatures such as sharks, octopi, kuo-toans, and 
sahuagin, The life spans of male morkoths are about 80 to 100 
years, while females die alter egg-laying. 

Once every ten years, a morkoth leaves its tunnels and wan¬ 
ders the seas searching for a mate, leaving a distinctive odor trail 
that is easy for morkoths to identify and follow, After mating, 
the male morkoth returns to Its tunnels and the female lays a 
clutch of about 25 eggs, which she buries in the ocean floor, She 
then dies. The eggs hatch in two months, and the immature 
morkoths struggle to survive, instinctively searching for vacant 
tunnels. Most hatchlings die on this journey, 

After six months, a young morkoth is mature enough to sur¬ 
vive (it now has 2 hp/HD, for 14 hit points). It grows into a full- 
sized, exceptionally intelligent morkoth adult by its fifth year.

Muckdwellers are a species of small intelligent bipedal amphib¬ 
ians that lurks in swamps, marshes, or still, mud-bottomed wa¬ 
ters, They have been known to serve lizard men and kuo-toa. 

Muckdwellers are only 1-foot tall and resemble upright gila 
monsters with large, partially webbed rear feet. Their Forepaws 
are prehensile, but very small and weak. Their backs are colored 
a mottled gray and brown, and their underbellies are yellow. 
They have short tails that are used for swimming and keeping 
their balance on land. They speak their own hissing language and 
possibly 150% chance) the lizard man tongue. 


Combat: Muckdwellers use ambush techniques. Packs of 
muckdwellers wait for a victim: when one arrives, several squirt 
water (at up to a ten-yard rangel into the victim's eyes, which 
temporarily blinds it (a successful saving throw vs, wands ne¬ 
gates this, but surprised creatures get no saving throw). A blind¬ 
ed victim cannot act in that round, loses all Dexterity bonuses, 
and all attacks against the victim gain a +2 bonus to the attack 
roll* Furthermore, if the muckdwellers lure the victim into knee- 
deep muddy waters, the victim loses all Dexterity bonuses and 
fights with a T penalty to its attack roll, due to unsteady ground. 
If the water is waist-high, the penalty increases to -2; if the water 
is chest-high, the penalty is -3. A ring of free action or equivalent 
magic negates these penalties. These disadvantages do not apply 
to the amphibious muckdwellers. Usually, a muckdweller fights 
only if it is cornered or if it is certain it can score an easy kill. 


HabitatSociety: The lair of these creatures is underwater, but 
they always have a muddy above-water area for resting, sunning 
Lhemselves, and eating. There are 5d4 muckdwellers in each lair. 
They keep shiny-things (gold, gems, etc.) in hoards in their 
above ground lairs. If 16 or more monsters are encountered in 
this lair, they have double the given type Q treasure, 
Muckdwellers are an intelligent species, but: they have very lit¬ 
tle culture. They have a very primitive nature worship that em¬ 


phasizes the supremacy of water over land. They like shiny 
things because they gleam like the sea. Due to the weakness of 
their hands, they do not use or produce tools and use their back 
paws for burrowing and their teeth for cutting. They occasional¬ 
ly build tiny rafts of cut reeds and mud to float on the surface of 
the water, and propel themselves quickly with their hind legs 
(movement 18). They infrequently build crude shelters of reeds, 
twigs, and mud. These shelters are designed to protect them from 
predators, not to shelter them, as weather doesn't bother them 
very much. 

Because of the size difference between muckdwellers and lizard 
men, muckdwellers consider lizard men to be a superior species 
and occasionally serve them. Muckdwellers believe in the "sur¬ 
vival of the fittest" and have no room for love, mercy, or compas¬ 
sion. Scoring the deathbite on a much larger creature gives the 
individual elite status in the community, while being killed by a 
bigger creature is a mark of shame, for it demonstrates poor 
hunting ability. 

Ecology: Omnivorous muckdwellers will eal plants, insects, 
and aquatic animals, but fresh, warm-blooded meat is their pre¬ 
ferred diet. 

Muckdwellers are amphibians that spend their larval stage in 
the water but their adult stage on land, Their average life span is 
9 to 12 years. It takes three years to grow to full-size. Muck¬ 
dwellers in temperate climates hibernate during the winter 
months. Their natural enemies are snakes and certain giant car¬ 
nivorous fishes. A muckdweller community has a hunting range 
of about two miles' radius.

Mudmen are formed in pools of mud where enchanted rivers 
(even mildly enchanted ones, such as a stream eroding a magical 
structure) collect and evaporate and concentrate the dweomer. 
Because they are creatures of magic, mudmen are sometimes 
called dtoeomerlings* Mudmen are unintelligent life forces with 
but one goal—to protect their pools against intruders. 

When aroused into a physical form, mudmen take on the ap¬ 
pearance of animated mud in a stocky humanoid shape, about 4 
feet tall Their coloration varies between a dirty brown and tar 
black. They have four thick fingers on each hand. Their legs stay 
submerged within the pool, and are not usually visible. Their 
eyes are pools of jet black shadow. 

Mudmen speak no languages and are incapable of communi¬ 
cating with any living creature. 

Combat: In their dormant state, mudmen wait beneath the sur¬ 
face of the pool spread on Lhe bottom, feeding on the dweomer 
In this state they are immune to all weapons, even magical ones. 
Spells that normally harm a mudmen will still affect it, although 
damage is divided evenly among all the mudmen in the pool (the 
entire group counts as one creature for these effects, and frac¬ 
tions are rounded down). When a creature enters the pool the 
mudmen immediately sense its presence and take but a single 
round to draw their substance together and rise to the surface, 
ready to attack on the following round. Once fully formed and 
standing, a mudmen can be harmed by magical weapons. 

Mudmen attack by hurling mud at their opponents, who axe 
considered AC 10 (modified by Dexterity) for the purpose of de¬ 
termining hits. Mud hardens on impact and slows the creature's 
movement rate by 1 if it hits. While hurling mud, a mudman will 
also advance on its victim at its full movement rate. Once within 
10 feet, it will hurl itself (literally) at the victim. A sucessful hit 
means the death of the mudman. but slows the victim's move¬ 
ment by 4. A miss means the mudman must spend the next round 
re-forming in order to attack again. 

Once a victim’s movement is brought to 0, he becomes immo¬ 
bilized and suffocates, suffering 1-8 points of damage per round 
until the mouth or nose is clear. The victim will die of suffocation 



in five consecutive rounds unless rescued. Hardened mud can be 
cleared from a character's nose and mouth in one round. Move¬ 
ment can be restored at a rate of 1 per five rounds. 

If the creature flees the pool, the mudmen will not pursue, as 
their senses do not extend beyond the pool. Instead, they sink 
into the depths, return to their dormant state, and wait until the 
next time someone enters the pool 

Mudmen are affected by all spells that cause damage to living 
creatures (e.g., cause light wounds, magic missile , fireball flame 
strike ), Dispel magic and dig act as fireballs cast at the same level 
as the mage. 

Transmute mud to rock kills al] mudmen within its area of ef¬ 
fect, with no saving throw allowed. 

Mudmen are immune to all poisons, natural and magical, and 
are unaffected by spells that affect the mind (e.g., hold r charm r 
and sleep). 

Habitat,'Society: Mudmen have two states: rest and activity, 
the latter of which solely involves killing intruders. A mudman s 
pool varies in size between 20 and 200 feet in diameter. Such 
pools are often found near waterfalls. 

Ecology: Mudmen are not natural creatures and not part of the 
ecosystem. They try to kill all natural creatures that encounter 
them and have no natural enemies. Over a long period of time 
they absorb flesh, wood, and bone, extracting whatever 
dweomer they can get from it. so they rarely possess any 
treasure—only if they were attacked within the last month by 
someone who was bearing treasure. Though no uses have been 
recorded for a mudman s mud, it is logical that mages would not 
ignore its magical properties.

Mummies are corpses native to dry desert areas, where the dead 
are entombed by a process known as mummification, When their 
tombs are disturbed, the corpses become animated into a weird 
unlife state, whose unholy hatred of life causes them to attack 
living things without mercy, 

Mummies are usually (but not always) clothed in rotting strips 
of Jinen. They stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and are supematu- 
rally strong. 

Combat; Mummies are horrific enemies, A single blow from 
ones arm inflicts 1T2 points of damage, and worse, its scabrous 
touch infects the victim with a rotting disease which is fatal in 1-6 
months. For each month the rot progresses, the victim perma¬ 
nently loses 2 points of Charisma, The disease can be cured only 
with a cure disease spell, Cure wounds spells have no effect on a 
person inflicted with mummy rot and his wounds heal at 10% of 
the norma] rate. A regenerate spell will restore damage but will 
not otherwise affect the course of the disease. 

The mere sight of a mummy causes such terror in any creature 
that a saving throw versus spell must be made or the victim be¬ 
comes paralyzed with fright for 1 to 4 rounds. Numbers will bol¬ 
ster courage: for each six creatures present, the saving throw is 
improved by +1. Humans save against mummies af an addition¬ 
al + 2. 

Mummies can be harmed only by magical weapons, which in¬ 
flict only half damage (all fractions round down). Sleep, charm, 
hold, and cold-based spells have no effect. Poison and paralysis 
do not harm them. A resurrection spell will turn Lhe creature into 
a normal human (a fighter at 7th level ability) with the memories 
o! its former life: or will have no effect if the mummy is older 
than the maximum age the priest can resurrect. A ndsfr will also 
restore a mummy to human form but a remove curse will not. 

Mummies are vulnerable to fire, even nonmagical varieties. A 
blow with a torch inflicts 1-3 points of damage. A flask of burn¬ 
ing oil inflicts T8 points of damage on the first round it hits and 
2-16 on the second round. Magical fires are +1 damage/die. Vi¬ 
als of holy water inflict 2-8 points of damage per direct hit. 

Any creature killed by a mummy rots immediately and cannot 
be raised from death unless both a cure disease and a raise dead 
spell are cast within six rounds. 



Habitat/Society: Mummies are the product of an embalming 
process used on wealthy and important personages. Most mum¬ 
mies are corpses without magical properties, On occasion, per¬ 
haps due to powerful evil magic or perhaps because the 
individual was so greedy in life that he refuses to give up his trea¬ 
sure, the spirit of the mummified person will not die. but taps 
into energy from the Positive Material plane and is transformed 
into an undead horror Most mummies remain dormant until 
their treasure is taken, but then they become aroused and kill 
without mercy, 

A mummy lives in its ancient burial chamber, usually in the 
heart of a crypt or pyramid. The tomb is a complex series of 
chambers filled with relics (mostly nonmagical]. These relics in¬ 
clude models of the mummy's possessions, favorite items and 
treasures, the bodies of dead pets, and foodstuffs to feed the spir¬ 
it after death. Particularly evil people will have slaves or family 
members slain when they die so the slaves can be buried with 
them. Because of their magical properties, mummies exist on 
both Prime and Positive Material planes. 

Ecology: To create a mummy a corpse should be soaked in a 
preserving solution (typically carbonate of soda) for several 
weeks and covered with spices and resins. Body organs, such as 
the heart, brain, and liver, are typically removed and sealed in 
jars. Sometimes gems are wrapped in the cloth (if the treasure 
listing for the mummy indicates it possesses gems, a few may be 
placed in the wrappings). Mummies are not part of the natural 
ecosystem and have no natural enemies. 

Mummy dust is a component for rotting and disease magical 
items.

Also known as Arthkfepofs Children . greater mummies are a 
powerful form of undead created when a high-level lawful evil 
priest of certain religions is mummified and charged with the 
guarding of a burial place. It can survive for centuries as the 
steadfast protector of its lair, killing all who would defile its holy 
resting place. 

Greater mummies look just like their more common cousins 
save that they are almost always adorned with (un)holy symbols 
and wear the vestments of their religious order They give off an 
odor that is said to be reminiscent of a spice cupboard because of 
the herbs used in the embalming process that created them. 

Greater mummies are keenly intelligent and are able to com¬ 
municate |ust as they did in life. Further, they have an inherent 
ability to telepathically command all normal mummies created 
by them. They have the ability to control other mummies, pro¬ 
vided that they are not under the domination of another mum¬ 
my, but this is possible only when verbal orders can be given. 

Combat: Greater mummies radiate an aura of fear that causes all 
creatures who see them to make a fear check. A modifier is ap¬ 
plied to this fear check based on the age of the monster, as indi¬ 
cated on the Age &amp; Abilities table at the end of this section. The 
effects of failure on those who miss their checks are doubled be¬ 
cause of the enormous power and presence of this creature. The 
mummy's aura can be defeated by a remove fear, cloak of brav¬ 
ery, or similar spell. 

In combat, greater mummies have the option of attacking with 
their own physical powers or with the great magic granted to 
them by the gods they served in life. In the former case, they may 
strike but once per round, inflicting 3d6 points of damage per 
attack. 

Anyone struck by the mummy's attack suffers the required 
damage and becomes infected with a horrible rotting disease that 
is even more sinister than that of normal mummies for it mani¬ 
fests itself in a matter of days, not months. The older the mum¬ 
my, the faster this disease manifests itself (see the Age &amp; Ability 
table aL the end of this entry for exact details). The disease causes 
the person to die within a short time unless proper medical care 
can be obtained. Twenty four hours after the infecting blow 
lands, the character loses 1 point from his Strength and Constitu¬ 
tion due to the effects of the virus on his body. Further they lose 
2 points of Charisma as their skin begins to flake and whither like 
old parchment. No normal healing is possible while the disease 



is spreading through the body, and the shaking and convulsions 
that accompany it make spell casting or memorization impos¬ 
sible for the character. Only one form of magical healing has any 
effect—a regenerate spell will cure the disease and restore lost hit 
points, but not ability scores. All others healing spells are wast¬ 
ed, A series of cure disease spells (one for each day that has 
passed since the rotting was contracted) will temporarily halt the 
infection until a complete cure can be affected. Regaining lost 
ability score points is not possible through any means short of a 
ioish&lt; 

The body of a person who dies from mummy rot begins to 
crumble into dust as soon as death occurs. The only way to resur¬ 
rect a character who dies in this way is to cast both a cure disease 
and a raise dead spell on the body within 6 turns Cl hour) of 
death. If this is not done r the body (and the spirit within it) are 
lost forever, 

Greater mummies can be turned by those who have the cour¬ 
age and conviction to attempt this feat: however, the older the 
mummy, the harder it is to overcome in this fashion. Once again, 
the details are provided on the Age &amp; Abilities Table, They are 
immune to damage from holy water, but contact with a holy 
symbol from a non-evil faith inflicts Ld6 points of damage on 

them. Contact with a holy symbol of their own faith actually re¬ 
stores Td6 hit points. 

Perhaps the most horrible aspect of these creatures, however, 
is their spell casting ability. All greater mummies were priests in 
their past lives and now retain the spell casting abilities they had 

then. They will cast spells as if they were of 16th through 20th 
level (see below) and will have the same spheres available to 
them that they did in life. Greater mummies receive the same bo¬ 
nus spells for high Wisdom scores that player characters do. 
Dungeon Masters are advised to select spells for each greater 
mummy in an adventure before the adventure starts, For those 
using Legends 6 Lore in their games, greater mummies are most 
often priests of Osiris. Set, and Nephythys. For those using The 
Complete Priests Handbook, they are usually associated with 


262 










Mummy; Greater 


the worship of duces tors, darkness, death, disease, evil, guardi¬ 
anship, and revenge. (If neither of these works is being used in 
the campaign, simply assign the mummy powers as if it were a 
standard high-level deric.) 

Greater mummies can be harmed only by magical weapons, 
with older ones being harder to hit than younger ones. Even if a 
weapon can affect them, however, it wilt inflict only half damage 
because of the magical nature of the creature s body. 

Spells are also less effective against greater mummies than t hey 
are against other creatures. Those that rely on cold to inflict 
damage are useless against the mummy, while those that depend 
on fire inflict normal damage. Unlike normal mummies, these 
foul creatures are immune to non-magical fire. The enchanting 
process that creates them, however leaves them vulnerable to at¬ 
tacks involving electricity; all spells of that nature inflict half 
again their normal damage. In addition, older mummies develop 
a magic resistance that makes even those spells unreliable. 

Greater mummies, like vampires, become more powerful with 
the passing of time in Ravenloft. The following table lists the ap¬ 
plicable changes to the listed statistics (which are for a newly ere- 
ated monster) brought on by the passing of time:

Notes: 

To Hit indicates the magical plus that must be associated with a 
weapon before it will inflict damage to the mummy, 

AC is the .Armor Class of the monster* 

HD are the number oi hit dice that the mummy has. Greater 
mummies are turned as if they had one more Hit Die than they 
actually do. so a 250 year old (10 + 3) is turned as if it had 11 Hit 
Dice. Any mummy 500 years old or older is turned as a "special" 
undead. 

THAC0 as listed for the various Hit Dice levels of the mummy 
to allow for easy reference during play* 

Alignment As the mummy growrs older, it becomes darker and 
more evil. In cases where two alignments are listed, there is a 
75% chance that the mummy will be of the first alignment and a 
25% chance thaL it will be of the second. Thus, a 300 year old 
mummy is 75% likely to be chaotic evil. 

Wisdom is the creature's Wisdom score. When employing their 
spells, greater mummies receive all of the bonus spells normally 


associated with a high Wisdom. Further, as they pass into the 
higher ratings (19 and beyond) they gain an immunity to certain 
magical spells as listed in the Player s Handbook. 

Magic is the creature's natural magic resistance. As can be seen 
from the table, old mummies can be very deadly indeed. 

Disease is the length of time it takes for a person infected with 
the mummy's rotting disease to die. 

Level! indicates the creature's level as a priest. Older mummies 
have access to far greater magics than younger ones and are thus 
more dangerous than younger ones. 

XP lists the number of experience points awarded to a party for 
battling and defeating a greater mummy of a given age. 

Mummies indicates the number of normal mummies that the 
creature will have serving it when encountered. 

Fear indicates the penalty to those making fear checks due to 
the evil influence of the greater mummy's foul aura, 

Habitat/Sodety: Greater mummies are powerful undead crea¬ 
tures that are usually created from the mummified remains of 
powerful, evil priests. This being the case, the greater mummy 
now draws its mystical abilities from evil powers and darkness. 
In rare cases, however, the mummified priests served non-evil 
god in Ide and are still granted the powers they had in life from 
those gods, 

Greater mummies often dwell in large temple complexes or 
tombs where they guard the bodies of the dead from the distur¬ 
bances of grave robbers. Unlike normal mummies, however, 
they have been known to leave their tombs and strike out into the 
world—bringing a dreadful shroud of evil down upon every land 
they touch. 

When a greater mummy wishes to create normal mummies as 
servants, it does so by mummifying persons infected with its rot- 
ting disease. This magical process requires 12-18 hours (10 +2d4) 
and cannot be disturbed without ruining the enchantment. Per¬ 
sons to be mummified are normally held or charmed so that they 
cannot resist the mummification process, Once the process is 
completed, victims are helpless to escape the bandages that bind 
them. If nothing happens to free them, they will die of the mum¬ 
my rot just as they would have elsewhere. Upon their death, 
however, a strange transformation takes place. Rather than 
crumbling away into dust, these poor souls rise again as normal 
mummies. Obviously, this process is too time consuming to be 
used in actual combat, but the greater mummy will often attack a 
potential target in hopes of capturing and transforming it into a 
mummy. All mummies created by a greater mummy are under its 
telepathic command. 

Ecology: The first of these creatures is known to have been pro¬ 
duced by Anhktepot. the Lord of Harakir, in the years before he 
became undead himself, It is believed that most, if not all, of the 
greater mummies he created in his life were either destroyed or 
drawn into Raven loft with him when he was granted a domain* 
A number of these creatures are believed to serve Anhktepot in 
his domain, acting as his agents in other lands he wishes to learn 
what is transpiring in other portions of Ravenlof t. 

The process by which a greater mummy is created remains a 
mystery to all but Anhktepot, It is rumored that this process in¬ 
volves a great sacrifice to gain the favor of the gods and an oath 
of eternal loyalty to the Lord of Har'akir. If the latter is true, then 
it may lend credence to the claim of many sages that Anhktepot 
can command every greater mummy in existence to do his bid¬ 
ding. It this is indeed the case, it makes the power of this dark 
fiend far greater than is generally supposed.

Myconids, or fungus men, are a race of intelligent fungi that live 
in the remote reaches of the Underdark. They are cautious crea¬ 
tures that deplore violence; myconids have no desire to conquer 
anybody and would prefer to be left alone, 

Myconids resemble walking toadstools in human form. Their 
Flesh is bloated and spongy and varies in color from purple to 
gray. Their wide feet have vestigial toes and their pudgy hands 
have two stubby fingers and a thumb on either side. Myconids' 
Hit Dice determine their social status and abilities* They have no 
spoken language. 

Combat: Fungus men fight by dubbing with their clasped 
hands, causing ld4 points of damage per Hit Die. Thus a 1-Hit 
Die myconid inflicts ld4 points of damage, a 2-Hit Die myconid 
causes 2d4 points of damage, etc*, up to the 6-Hit Dice king that 
inflicts 6d4 points of damage on a hit. 

Myconids also have the ability to spew forth clouds of special 
spores. The number and kind of spores increase as they grow. As 
each myconid advances to another size leveL it gains the ability 
to spray another type of spores, and the number of times per day 
that each spore type can be emitted also increases* A myconid 
can emit each of its spore types a number of times per day equal 
to its Hit Dice. For example, a 3-HD myconid (6 feet tall) can 
spray three types of spores, and it may use each type three times 
per day. These spore types include the following: 

Distress ? This spore type is used to alert other myconids to 
danger or a need for aid. The cloud expands at a rate of 40 feet 
per round, expanding to its maximum of 120 feet in three rounds. 
This ability ls gained at the 1-Hit Die level. 

Reproducer: These spores are only emitted at the proper time 
for growing new myconids so the population can be rigidly con¬ 
trolled. They are also automatically ejected by a dying myconid. 
This ability is gained at the 2-Hit Dice level. 

Rapport: These spores are primarily used in the melding proc¬ 
ess. However, they can be used by the myconids to communicate 
with other species, since the fungus men do not talk, A small 


cloud of spores is aimed at one person; if the person fails a saving 
throw vs, poison (it can choose to fail), it can go into telepathic 
rapport, speaking mind-to-mind with the myconid as if it were 
normal speech* The range of this effect is 40 feet. The duration is 
a number of turns equal to the Hit Dice of the myconid, This 
ability is gained at the 3-Hit Dice level. 

Pacifier: This type of spore cloud may be spewed at a single 
creature. If the creature fails its saving throw vs. poison, it be¬ 
comes totally passive, unable to do anything. The affected crea¬ 
ture only observes; it is unable to perform any action even if 
attacked. The range of this effect is 40 feet. The duration of this 
effect is a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the myconid* 
This ability is gained at the 4-Hit Dice level. 

Ha//urinfiton This type of spore is usually used in the meldmg 
ritual, but a myconid can project them at an attacker. The spore 
cloud may be shot at one creature, and if that creature fails its 
saving throw vs* poison, it suffers violent hallucinations for a 
number of turns equal to the Hit Dice of the myconid* Halluci¬ 
nating creatures react as follows (roll ld20): 

D20 Roll Reaction 

I- 10 Cower and whimper 

II- 15 Stare into nothingness 

16-1$ Flee shrieking in a random direction 

19-20 Try to kill the closest creature 

The range of this effect is 40 feet. This ability is gained at the 5- 
Hit Dice level. 

Animator: This ability is gained at the 6-Hit Dice level, the 
level only the king may achieve. The king uses these spores to 
infect a dead animal or creature. A purple fungus quickly covers 
the corpse, taking over the dead body systems and putting it to 
work, animating the corpse to resemble a zombie (AC 10, Move 
9, HD 1, hp 4, 0AT 2 r Dmg bony claws for 1-3/1-3L It is not 
undead and cannot be turned by priests. It always strikes last in a 
round* The body continues to rot and the fungus gradually re¬ 
places the missing parts, becoming specialized to take over their

Myconid (Fungus Man) 


Functions. Eventually, however, the decay proceeds too far. and 
the body stops functioning, able to rest at last. Animation takes 
place Id4 days after infection, and the corpse is animated for 
ld4+l weeks before it decays, Animated creatures will follow 
simple orders given by the animator (with rapport spores) to the 
best of thetr ability Orders take priority over self-preservation. 

A myconid has a deathly fear of sunlight and will not willingly 
travel to the surface world. The exact effects of sunlight on a my¬ 
conid are unknown, but they must be highly detrimental for the 
fungus men to fear sunlight as they do. 

Habitat Society: Myconid society is based on "circles," ex¬ 
tremely tight social groups that are linked by group work and 
melding sessions, Myconid circles usually consist of 20 members: 
four ot each size from 1-5 Hit Dice ri.e., four I-HD, four 2-HD, 
etc.). Each community consists of ldlO circles, 

Each circles day is rigidly structured: eight hours of rest, fol¬ 
lowed by eight hours of farming the fungus crops, followed by 
eight hours of melding. For the myconids, melding is entertain¬ 
ment, worship, and social interaction combined. Hie fungus men 
gather in a tight circle and the elder myconid release rapport and 
hallucinatory spores. The entire group then merges into a collec¬ 
tive telepathic hallucination for eight hours, Myconids consider 
this melding to- be the reason for their existence. Only distress 
spores will bring a circle out of its mdd before the eight hours 
have elapsed. 

The myconid king is always the largest member of the colony 
and is the only member at the 6-Hit Dice level. It is also the only 
myconid that is not the member of a circle, The other myconids 
regard separation from the circles with horror and pity the lonely 
king. The leadership role is thought of as an unpleasant duty al¬ 
most a condemnation. However, when the old king dies, the 
strongest 3-Hit Dice myconid always assumes the role of the new 
king. The king must remain outside of circles to retain objectivity 
and to pay close attention to the duties of leadership. The king 
animates guardians for the colony so the myconids need not 
commit violence. It coordinates the work schedule and pays at¬ 
tention to affairs outside the colony that could affect the fungus 
men. The king also practices fungal alchemy brewing special po¬ 
tions that may be useful in times of trouble. 

In general, myconids are a peaceful race, desiring only to work 
and meld in peace. There are no recorded instances of disharmo¬ 
ny or any sort of violence or disagreement between myconids. If 
forced into combat, they avoid killing if at all possible: violence 
adversely affects their melding, 

Accord has never been reached between fungoid and human¬ 
oid. Each views the other as a disgusting threat; humanoids see 
myconids as ugly monsters, Myconids view humanoids as a vio¬ 
lent, insane species out to conquer anything in their path, destroy 
anything they can t conquer, then go back down the path to 
make sure there isn't anything they forgot to destroy or conquer. 
Myconids find it difficult to believe that humanoids are not going 
to immediately use violence against them, and so they are very 
reluctant to deal with them. Given population pressures in the 
underworld in which the myconids live, further conflicts seem 
inevitable. If the myconids are approached in peace, it is possible 
that they will communicate, though they will be suspicious. 

Myconids live in Underdark regions, which are large cavern¬ 
ous underground areas that range in size form a large cavern 
complex to an entire secret continent beneath the ground. My¬ 
conids try Lo find isolated spots away from civilized areas. These 
communities will usually be near water, for they like dampness. 
Work details sometimes patrol the Underdark. looking for signs 
of battles and unburied dead, which they bring to the king to 
animate; these are the only myconids that will be found outside 


of their lair. A myconid community is arranged around mounds 
of moss-covered stones, on which the circle members sit when 
they meld, and on which they sleep. There will also be a large 
garden area; the myconids feed on water and small Fungi, and the 
king uses the garden ingredients to make his potions. Dead my¬ 
conid kings are buried with honor beneath the mounds, while 
dead myconids are buried near the gardens. 

Ecology: Myconids are an unusual species of fungi. They' grow 
fungi, which later decay, and the myconids feed from these soil 
nutrients. 

A myconid has a life span of 24 years. It requires four years to 
grow to each Hit Die, thus a 1-Hit Die myconid is four years old, 
a 2-Hit Die myconid is eight years old, etc., to a maximum of 5 
Hit Dice at 20 years of age. It requires a special regimen for a 
myconid to reach 6 Hit Dice (king). 

A myconid king has the ability to brew magical potions from 
fungi. In addition to standard magical potions, a myconid king 
can brew the following: 

Potion of Fungus Growth: This is used in times of populat ion 
shortage, when myconid circles need their young members to 
grow quickly. This potion increases a myconid s Hit Dice by 1, It 
can only be used on a myconid once in its lifetime: repeated doses 
have no effect. 

Potion of Fungus Healing This potion only works on fungi. It 
heals ld6 +1 lost hit points. 

Potion of Decay: This poison affects a humanoid creature as if 
it were a dead creature infected with purple fungi spores. The 
victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die, re¬ 
placed within ld4 +1 days by a fungal intelligence friendly to the 
myconids, which lasts for ld4 +1 weeks before permanently de¬ 
caying. A cure disease spell will prevent the victim's death if cast 
within three minutes of the infection. The combination of a cure 
disease spell and a raise dead spell will bring back victims of the 
fungus disease after 43 hours. This potion is rarely used by the 
fungus men. 

Powders of Hallucination: This is used when hallucinatory 
spores are in short supply due to the death oi 4- and 5-Hit Die 
members of the circles. It is also used as a defensive measure 
when myconids are certain they are going to be attacked; a pow¬ 
der is bundled and placed on a spider-silk film inside the entrance 
to their circle. Creatures of size M will break the powder free, 
affecting all creatures in a 20-foot radius as hallucinatory spores. 

Potion of Anointment: This is the special regimen that enables 
a 5-Hit Die fungus to grow to 6 Hit Dice and become king. 
Growth is immediate and painful. It affects a myconid only once. 
It is poisonous to humans {successful saving throw vs, poison or 
die). 

There is always one potion of anointment in the community. If 
other potions are Indicated, consult the following table: 

01-10 Another potion of anointment 
11 -20 Fo Non of fungi grow t h 

21-30 Potion of fungus healing 

31-40 Powder of hallucination 

41-45 Potion of decay 

46-00 Roll on standard potion table 

Alchemists have found a number of uses for myconid spores, 
typically in poisons and potions of delusion. Other than their po¬ 
tions, myconids produce little of value to humanoid creatures.

Possessing high intelligence and magical abilities* naga are snake- 
like creatures with human heads. They prefer warmer climates 
and tend not to wander far from their lairs. 

The cold-blooded naga have glittering scales and grow to an 
adult length of 10 to 20 feet. Their fidless eyes are bright and 
wide, almost luminescent, and their spines are armored with 
sharp triangular extensions that grow in a line from the napes of 
their necks to the tips of their tails. Wise and patient, these crea¬ 
tures can stay still for hours but move swiftly when alarmed. 
They favor resting in a semi-aware state that conserves their en¬ 
ergy and makes them very hard to surprise. Occasionally, naga 
fashion a pouch to carry items under their chins. Both land types 
have a distinctive smell that pervades their lair and nearby areas. 

Naga can usually speak four or more languages. 

Combat: Naga often set traps to snare trespassers. Magical 
spells are always attempted first, since naga have few melee 
skills* Once their magic is expended, naga rely on their poisonous 
bites—only the largest of these creatures can actually constrict 
victims like a giant snake, 

Habitat Society: Naga live solitary lives* hunting or foraging 
over an area usually only a quarter mile square. They favor 
dwelling in a deep hole* but sometimes are found curled up in 
ruins or in a darkened room. While the sexes are impossible to 
tell apart, there is a 10% chance that an encounter includes one 
or more mates. These matings are temporary, as a pregnant naga 
quickly leaves the male to hide her eggs in a secluded spot. Young 
naga resemble giant snakes until they reach adulthood; then their 
human-like head emerges after a long and painful molting. 

Ecology: While naga do not produce trade goods, their lives 
span many human generations and they keep a detailed oral his¬ 
tory, so they are good sources of information. They are often 
protectors of treasures or artifacts for centuries. Their hides can 
be fashioned into scale mail + 2, and their eyes and teeth have 
been sold for use in arcane spells. 


Guardian Naga 

Surrounded with a flowery sweet scent, the guardian naga is 
marked by green-gold scales* silvery spines, and flashing golden 
eyes. It is so called because its lawful good nature makes it a per¬ 
fect sentinel over a Uke-ahgned being's treasure or some evil. This 
naga always warns off trespassers, and often buries those defeat¬ 
ed in battle. The guardian naga can spit poison at an individual 
attacker at up to 30-foot range, and the poison kills all who fail 
their saving throws vs. poison. In addition to a poisonous bite 
and constriction, these naga have the ability to use priest spells as 
6thdevel priests* 

Spirit Naga 

These black-and-crimson-bandcd naga have a most human-like 
head, with stringy hair and deep brown eyes, and they smell of 
rotting flesh, which happens to be their preferred food! Hiding in 
deserted ruins or caverns, these evil and cunning spirit naga seek to 
cause harm to any creature Lhat passes through their domains. 
They set traps and frequently attack without warning. While they 
are not big enough to constrict their prey they have a poisonous 
bite, a gaze that charms (as a charm spell) all those who look into 
their eyes and fail a saving throw vs, paralyzation* and can use 
wizard spells at 5th-level ability and priest spells at 4tlvlevel abili¬ 
ty. 

Water Naga 

The beautiful water naga are emerald green to turquoise in redo 
ulated patterns with chocolate brown and pale jade green or dark 
grey and olive, and their spines have red spikes that raise like 
hackles when they are angry. Their eyes are pale green to amber. 
These naga are found in clear, fresh water, Curious but neutral in 
attitude* water naga seldom attack unless threatened. In addition 
to their poisonous bite that inflicts ld4 points of damage, these 
naga have 5th-!evel wizard spelt abilities. They never know spells 
that deal with fire.

Dark nagas are fey creatures who have human-like faces (with 
fanged mouths* on leathery, snake-like bodies* They usually 
work with other evil beings for mutual gain or survival. Dark 
nagas tend to be black, purplish-black, or very dark blue in hue, 
and their crested heads and smooth, almost invisible scales make 
them look like gigantic eels more than snakes. 

Combat: Dark nagas have natural ESP powers {00' rangeL and 
use this ability constantly. 

Dark nagas have a {non-poisonous) bite and a poisonous tail¬ 
sting; the barbed stinger does physical damage, and any struck being 
must save vs. poison or take 1-2 bp additional damage and fall into a 
drugged sleep (onset time 1 round, sleep lasts 2d4 rounds). 

The most feared ability of dark nagas is their power to wield 
magic. A dark naga casts spells as a 6th-level wizard (4,2,2), and 
employs only verbal spells. It may learn these spells from drag¬ 
ons. Phaerimm, or other creatures who can cast spells with but a 
word or thought (aci-of-will spells, as opposed to spell-like natu¬ 
ral powers* can easily be altered into verbal-release magics . , 
but the devising of a verbal-only version of a spell that normally 
has somatic and material components is not nearly so simple a 
matter)* It may devise new spells, or verbal^only spell versions, 
itself by means of experimentation, Either means of acquiring 
new magics is slow and expensive, and this can often force dark 
nagas into servitude to a stronger evil creature or anyone who 
hires them, or into the life of an adventurer. 

Dark nagas are immune to the effects of all known (normal 
and magical 1 acids, venoms, and poisons. Some have been 
known to swallow poisons and act as a courier, spitting up the 
dangerous liquid when they deliver it to its destination. They can 
spit poison that they are so carrying up to 10’ distant at any op¬ 
ponent; this requires a successful attack roll, and takes the place 
of their bite, though a naga can elect to bite and then release the 
poison as it does so. combining the damage. 

In battle, a dark naga may use its sting and either a spell or a 
bite in the same round, If space permits, the naga can direct its 
sting and bite against the same foe. but it is quite intelligent 
enough to direct attacks at multiple opponents, even attacking 
foes in front of and behind it, simultaneously, if caught between 
them in a narrow passage. 

Dark nagas cannot be mind-read; their ESP ability somehow 
renders them immune to the ESP-like probes of others. They are 
subject but resistant to charm, sleep* hold and similar 



enchantment/charm spells, receiving a +2 bonus to all saving 
throws against this school of magic* 

Habitat Society: Dark nagas lair in rocky places, such as caverns 
or ruins; they like to have a home where they can hide things 
(such as treasures and spellbooks), that has more than one entry 
or exit, and at least one place narrow enough that they can block 
it with their body, and singlehandedly fight off intruders, Dark 
nagas are fond of traps, and will devise these (or hire other crea¬ 
tures to Install them) whenever possible. 

Dark nagas tend to be loners, but can form stable family 
groups of two or three; they are bisexual, and give birth to a 
squirming mass of isi^ny wormlike young which they promptly 
abandon to fend for themselves. Intelligent enough to know they 
can prevail against few creatures in the Realms alone, dark nagas 
work with other evil creatures, such as ores, hobgoblins, drow, 
phaerimm, beholders, and the like. They like to fill a "com¬ 
mander and magical strike force” role, perhaps in a sergeant-like 
intermediary rank, under a more powerful ruler—but they are 
wise enough to adopt the faith, beliefs, and rules of whatever 
group they join, 

Ecology: Dark nagas do not willingly eat other dark nagas, but 
they will eat just about anything else, both alive and dead. They 
eat a few lichens and the occasional green plant , but their main 
diet is meat. They especially prize hot, still-fresh blood. 

Dark nagas spend their lives outwardly working with, or serv¬ 
ing, others. Whenever possible, however, they also pursue pri¬ 
vate goals, which may be as whimsical and odd as some human 
goals ("cover this desert valley with trees" for instance), but al¬ 
ways include increasing their personal power by acquiring new 
spells and magical items. Dark nagas are quick to plunder fallen 
foe, swallowing items, scrolls, and spellbooks to spiL forth 
later—for all dark nagas have a bag-like internal organ that they 
can use to carry things. This organ has thick, rubbery air-sac 
walls to protect the naga against sharp points and the like, but it 
also protects the cargo against digestive juices, and has the unu¬ 
sual side-effect of shielding magic from all detection spells.

The neogi appear as a cross between a wolf spider and a moray 
eel The short, furry, eight-limbed body is topped by a lithe, 
bare, fleshy neck with a serpentine head, its mouth filled with 
needle-sharp teeth. The ends of its limbs are tipped with small 
claws. The fur of the neogi is a light tan, but dyed a variety of 
colors to signify power, rank, accomplishments, and warnings to 
other neogi, The older a neogi grows, the more colorful its hide 
becomes. 

The neogi are ruthless slayers and plunderers, and think noth¬ 
ing of eating their enemies, servants, or fallen comrades. They 
are a hateful, xenophobic race* 

Neogi can communicate in their own language and in Com¬ 
mon, Many speak 1-4 other languages to help facilitate their 
slaves taking orders correctly. 

Combat: The neogi have a number of defenses, the first, and 
most obvious being their enslavement of umber hulks (see entry). 
Each neogi has a personal umber hulk slave who is a combination 
bodyguard, manservant, and useful set of hands* Second, the 
bite of the neogi is poisonous. Those bitten and failing a saving 
throw vs, poison are affected as by a slow spell for IdS rounds. 
Multiple bites will extend this period by an additional ld8 rounds 
per bite. Lastly 1 in 10 neogi has some magical ability equal to 
human spell use of levels 1-8. 

Habitat'Society: The hated neogi are only found in very remote 
locations, deep beneath the earth, or among the farthest stars. 
Their lives revolve around their communities and their slaves. 

Neogi area slaving race with an inborn sense of property: all is 
either owned or owner, slave or neogi. Even neogi are slaves to 
other neogi, but slave-neogi may have their own slaves. The 
neogi tattoo their norvneogi slaves with symbols of ownership, 
usually on the left shoulder in the front and back. 

Captive umber hulks are trained from birth to follow their 
“small lords," caring for their every need. Any neogi can com¬ 
mand another umber hulk (the effect of this command is akin to 
the effect of the charm monster spell). 

The neogi world view of own or be owned" has resulted in a 
paranoid outlook that borders on xenophobia, and their relent¬ 
less attacks on other races result in their being universally hated. 



The only "normal" race with ties to neogi are the mind flayers, 
who make a profit on the neogi slave trade. 

Ecology: As a neogi grows older and his mind fades, his orders 
become confused and his slaves become disobedient. His fellow 
neogi may choose to poison the older one at once. The different 
poisons moving through its body overload the old neogi s sys¬ 
tem, and it begins its change into a Great Old Master, 

The neogi making the transformation swells to 20 feet in height 
and a similar girth. Its legs and arms become useless, and its intel¬ 
ligence fades; it now lives only to eat, Uve flesh is preferred, but 
the dead will sustain it* A Great Old Master inflicts ld!2 points 
of damage per round to any creature it is fed. 

After 2 months of eating, the skin of the Great Old Master 
bursts and a new crop of mature neogi spill forth. These are un¬ 
marked and barely sentient at birth, and for the next week the 
brood area resounds with combat as the young neogi kill each 
other for food. Of the 20-40 neogi that eat their way out, only 
about 3-6 survive. These are considered slaves of the community, 
until such a time as they claim an umber hulk as their personal 
slave* 

If a Great Old Master is attacked and its flesh pierced, it re¬ 
leases 2d4 neogi to defend itself. These are taken from the future 
brood, and are not replaced. Blunt weapons will not pierce the 
skin and therefore do not bring forth young. Edged or piercing 
weapons, or magical spells that pierce or bum, will produce this 
defensive reaction. 

Reaver 

These rogue neogi have rebelled and are seeking to escape the 
other neogi and their poisons that will transform Lhem into Great 
Old Masters* Rogue neogi are little better than their fellows, and 
are. if anything, more desperate, due to being pursued by their 
former fellows, all eager to start the process of producing more 
neogi.

Nightmares are the evil steeds of the lower planes, often serving 
as mounts for baatezu, tanar'ri, night hags, liches, and powerful 
undead lords. 

They look like large, powerful horses with a jet black coat. 
Nightmares have glowing red eyes, flaming orange nostrils, and 
hooves that bum like embers. Their flowing manes and great 
tails are ragged and wild. 

Nightmares can understand commands from evil riders. They 
communicate among themselves by empathy 

Combat: Nightmares are hateful of material life. They will often 
attack any non-lower planar creature they encounter (and will 
sometimes attack the lower planar creatures, too). They have vi¬ 
cious fangs that inflict 2-8 points of damage on a successful bite. 
Their burning hooves each inflict 4-10 (ld6 + 4) points of damage 
per attack and will set any combustibles on fire. 

During combat, the excitement and fervor of the fight will 
cause nightmares to emit a smoking, hot cloud of noxious va¬ 
pors, It blinds and chokes all those within 10 feet of the evil steed. 
Victims must make a saving throw vs, paralyzation or beat a “2 
penalty on their attack and damage dice. 

Although they have no wings, nightmares are able to magi¬ 
cally propel themselves through the air at an impressive rate. 
They may fly through the Astral and Ethereal planes at will. 

Habitat Society: Nightmares are the servitor steeds of many 
lower planar creatures. They are intelligent, however, and can¬ 
not be treated as casually as a simple horse. They will willingly 
and gleefully serve as a mount for any mission involving evil. 
However, for the unwary rider, a nightmare's own ambitions can 
prove to be insurmountable. These hateful steeds will often do 
what they want rather than follow the wishes of their "master*" In 
many ways, nightmares pose the same problems as magical 
weapons with large egos. 

Anyone on the lower planes who is not a native thereof can 
attract the attention of a nightmare to secure it as a mount. The 
process involves several spells, as well as an offering for the crea¬ 
ture's service. The summoning requires a mage or specialist wiz¬ 
ard of at least 5th level. The following spells must all be cast by 
the same spell-user. First, the mage must cast a mount spell. This 
conjuration is used to attract the attention of the nightmare. 
Next, a monster summoning III spell must be cast to bind the 



nightmare into service. When that is complete, a of fog spell 
is cast. If all of this is done properly the nightmare will come 
galloping through the fog, nostrils flaring and eyes gleaming, 
ready to perform in the service of evil* Lastly, an offering is re¬ 
quired, This may be given by anyone, not just the spell caster. 
The offering must be oat-like flakes made from platinum that the 
nightmare will eat. The flakes must be of at least 200 gp value. 
Whoever feeds the oats to the nightmare will be its master for 72 
hours, 

Creatures of the lower planes do not perform these steps to 
summon a nightmare. It is unknown what dark agreement they 
make for a nightmares service, 

Once per decade, on the plane of Hades, there is a dark and 
sinister time called Gloom Meet* At this time the various lower 
planar denizens will meet and decide how they will spread their 
will for the next decade. The nightmares play a special role in 
doom Meet , for they spread the word that the meeting is about 
to begin. As the Gfoorci Meet approaches, there is a higher con¬ 
centration of nightmares and their frequency changes from very 
rare to uncommon. This is the first indication that Gloo^n Meet is 
to occur, and lasts for approximately two weeks. Immediately 
prior to the meeting, the nightmares ride the planes in a terrifying 
charge that notifies all that the Gloom Meet has started. 

Ecology: Nightmares are the wild steeds of the planes. It is their 
place in the lower planes to act as mounts for missions of evil and 
dread. They have no biological link to true horses, A nightmare 
is merely a foul minion of evil, without need of food or air, that 
through some unknown pact has taken the form of a huge, terri¬ 
ble steed. Nightmares are listed as carnivores, based solely on 
their habit of eating fallen foes whenever possible* However, 
there is nothing to indicate that the nightmares derive any of 
their sustenance from the flesh of animals—they more likely gain 
all their strength through their service to evil.

So beautiful that a glimpse can blind or even kill a man, the 
nymphs are the embodiment of loveliness, a triumph of nature. 

A nymph s beauty is beyond words—an ever-young woman 
with sleek figure and long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect 
teeth, full lips and gentle eyes. A nymph s scent is delightful, and 
her long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroi¬ 
dered with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence. A nymph's 
demeanor is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty. 
Nymphs speak their own musical language and the common 
tongue. 

Combat: Neutral in their alliances and cares, nymphs do not 
fight, but flee if confronted by an intruder or danger. Nymphs are 
able to cast dimension door once per day and can employ druidi- 
cal priest spells at 7th ability level, giving a nymph four 1st, two 
2nd, two 3rd, and one 4th level spell once per day. Looking at a 
nymph will cause permanent blindness unless the onlookers save 
versus spell. If the nymph is nude or disrobes, an onlooker will 
die unless a saving throw versus spell is successful. 

Habitat.Sodety: These beautiful females inhabit only the love¬ 
liest of wilderness places, clear lakes and streams, glacier palaces, 
ocean grottoes, and crystalline caverns. Nymphs prefer a solitary 
existence, but very occasionally a few will gather together in a 
place of spectacular charm, though these rendezvous seldom last 
for more than a few months. Animals of all types flock to a 
nymph to be petted and caressed, forgetting their natural enemies 
to gather around the lovely creature. 

There is a 10% chance that a nymph will be friendly if ap¬ 
proached by a good creature without the latter first glimpsing the 
nymph, by calling or other prior notice. On the other hand, if a 



nymph sees a human male with L8 Charisma and good alignment 
before he sees her, it is 90% probable that the nymph will be fa¬ 
vorably inclined toward the man. It is still necessary to make 
saving throws upon sighting the nymph, 

Nymphs hate ugliness and evil and sometimes will help to de¬ 
feat it. Any treasure they possess has usually been given to them 
by some lovesick man. 

Ecology: Like a druid, a nymph believes in the sanctity of na¬ 
ture and her environment and will try to keep her lair safe and 
pure. She will heal wounded animals and mend broken trees and 
plants. Sometimes she will even help a human in distress (5% 
chance). Since nymphs live for many generations, they can pro¬ 
vide a wealth of information on the history of an area and often 
know secret places, hide-outs, and entrances long forgotten. If a 
man is kissed by a nymph, all painful and troubling memories are 
forgotten for the rest of the day—this may be a boon to some and 
a curse to others, A lock of nymph’s hair can be used to create a 
powerful sleeping potion or, if enchanted and woven into a cloth 
and sewn into a garment, will magically add one point to the 
wearer s Charisma. The tears of a nymph can be used as an ingre¬ 
dient in a philter of love . if a woman bathes in a nymph's pool, 
her Charisma is increased by two points until she bathes again.

The dreaded cuttlefish" are the scourge of ocean-going sailors 
and fishermen. Malicious and cunning, giant octopi have been 
known to attack ships, sinking smaller craft and stealing crew 
members from the larger ships. 

Giant octopi change their color to blend into their surround¬ 
ings, and the range of colors and patterns available to them is 
extensive, from green to deep black, blue speckles and red 
stripes. Tentacles are often disguised as seaweed. Once camou- 
Liaged, there is only a 10% chance to detect them, and usually it 
is their eyes that give them away. Normal coloration is grey to 
brown, and their vicious beaks are a deep yellow with a bright 
orange mouth and tongue. 

Combat: An octopus will readily attack swimmers or small ves¬ 
sels in order to eat the crew. Several have been known to cooper¬ 
ate m order to overwhelm a larger ship, and any craft seized by 
these monsters loses way and comes to a full stop in three turns. 

A giant octopus generally attacks with six of its eight tentacles, 
using two to anchor itself. Each striking tentacle causes ld4 
points of damage, but unless the member is loosened or severed, 
it constricts for 2d4 points of damage every round after striking. 
If a victim is dragged dose enough to the beak, the monster can 
bite for 2d6 points of damage. 

Any victim under 8 feet tall or long can be struck by only one 
tentade at a time, and the chance that both upper limbs are 
pinned on a successful strike is 25%, while the chance that both 
upper limbs are free is also 25%, When both upper limbs are 
held, the victim has no attack; if only one limb is held the victim 
attacks with a -3 penalty to its attack roll; if both limbs are Free 
{i.e. r the tentacle is wrapped around the victims body) then the 
victim attacks with a -1 penalty to its attack roll, Tentades grip 
with a Strength of 18/20, Any creature with a Strength equal to 
or greater than IS 20 can grasp the tentade and negate its con¬ 
striction. This does not free the victim, and the octopus will im¬ 
mediately seek to drag the victim to its mouth to eat it, To break 
free, a tentade must be severed; this requires 8 points of damage. 
(These hit points are in addition to those the octopus gains from 
its S Hit Dice.) 



Once three or more tentades are severed, it is 90% probable 
that the octopus will retreat, ejecting a cloud of black ink 40 feet 
high by 60 feet wide by 60 feet long. This ink doud completely 
obscures the vision of any creature within it. The wounded octo¬ 
pus then camouflages itself in its lair or a nearby hiding place, It 
takes the monster two to three months to grow back severed ten¬ 
tades, 

Habitat/Sodety; While octopi cooperate to attack a food 
source, they live a solitary existence, preferring to shelter in 
warm water of medial to shallow depth. Lairs are made in 
wrecked ships and undersea caves; any treasure found there is 
just an incidental leftover from previous meals. Consummate 
hunters, these monsters have great patience and cover a very 
small area, waiting for their food to come to them. Mating sea¬ 
son comes every spring. Like most marine animals,.octopi leave 
their eggs in a reef to fend for themselves. 

Ecology: When prey is scarce, or if it has been wounded, an 
octopus turns to scavenging, eating everything from small crus¬ 
taceans to seaweeds. Survival is paramount with this monster. It 
prefers to hunt at night, and often a man missing during the late 
night watch has been grabbed by a giant octopus, pulled quickly 
over the side, and eaten. 

Giant octopi s leathery hide is tough and waterproof, and it is 
worked into fine rain ponchos by sailors lucky enough to catch 
and kill one. Another byproduct of these monsters is their ink — 
they are most often hunted for this commodity. Giant octopus 
ink can be used to pen magical scrolls.

Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, 
raids, and theft. ill-tempered and nasty these monsters are often 
found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of ore tribes, evil cler¬ 
ics. or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls. 

Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. 
Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black- 
brown, and {rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often 
oi a different color—or at least darker than their hides. Their 
eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or 
black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark 
green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dress¬ 
ing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their 
weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres 
to speak ore, troll, stone giant, and gnoll. as well as their own 
guttural language, A typical ogre's life span is 90 years. 

Combats In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individ¬ 
uals, but groups of 11 or more will have a leader, and groups of 
16 or more usually include two leaders and a chieftain. Ogres 
wielding weapons gel a Strength bonus of +2 to hit; leaders have 
+ 3, chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only 2-6 
points of damage and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per 
die. Young ogres fight as goblins. 

Habitat Society: Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep 
caverns to mountain tops, Tribes have 16-20 males, 2-12 females, 
and 2-fi young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level, and have 
access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, protection, 
and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging 
and they will eat anything. Their fondness for eif, dwarf, and 
haiding flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these 
will be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that 
an ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners are al¬ 
ways kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%), Extremely avaricious, 
ogres squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their 
own kind.

Ogre Chieftain 

if 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two pa¬ 
trol leaders and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster 
with 34-37 hit points and Armor Class 4, He inflicts 8-16 (2d6 + 6) 
points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon. Chieftains are 
usually the biggest and smartest ogres in their tribes. 



272 


Ogre Leader 

When more than II ogres are encountered, a leader will be 
present. He is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Ar- 













Etiology: Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, 
gems, and jewelry as well as human flesh. They are evil-natured 
creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and 
favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts 
nor labor 

Ogre Mage 

The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin 
with ivory horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with 
green, green with blue) and is darker in shade; the main excep¬ 
tion to this coloration js found in ogre magi with pale brown skin 
and yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes with white 
pupils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller 
and more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental 
clothing and armor. 

Combat: Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic: 
fly (for 12 turns), become invisible, cause darkness in a 10-foot 
radius, po/ymorp/i to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet 
to 12 feet tall), and regenerate one hit point per round (lost mem¬ 
bers must be reattached to regenerate). Once per day they can do 
the following: charm person , sleep, assume gaseous form, and 
create a cone of cold 60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20 
feet, which inflicts $-64 (8dS) points of damage (save vs. spell for 
half damage), Oriental ogres attack with magic first and resort to 
physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on morale. 

In battle, ogre magi prefer the naganata (75%) or scimitar and 
whip (25%). Those found in oriental settings might (25%) pos¬ 
sess ki power or have mastered a martial arts form. As ogre magi 
are intelligent, they wiU not fight if faced with overwhelming 
odds, but will flee to gather their forces or hide. 

Habitat Sodefy: These monsters live in fortified dwellings or 
caves and foray to capture slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi 
priests of up to 7th level have been reported. Tribes are small, 
with 2-5 females and 1-3 children that will not fight, but rather 
seek to escape in gaseous form . These monsters are extremely 
protective of their young and will battle with savage abandon to 
save one's life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these creatures 
will pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge 
and will never forget the insult of the kidnaping. 

If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of 
great strength (+2 on each Hit Die, attacking and saving as a 9 
Hit Dice monster). Treasure is divided by this chief and his trove 
is always the richest The tribe will have their own dan symbol 
typical to the oriental lands, and this symbol will be stitched on 
its war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses. 
The chief will often have the tribes symbol tattooed on his fore¬ 
head or back. 

Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special lan¬ 
guage, and the speech of normal ogres. 

Ecology: Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This 
monster's lair is usually a powerful structure that can be expanded 
into a mighty fortress if it can be nd of its original owners, 

Merrow (Aquatic Ogre) 

Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are 
greenish and scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are 
long and thick, their shoulders are sloping, and they have huge 
mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have black teeth and nails 
and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair resembles 
slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the 
more powerful males. 

Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have 
their entire bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a 



sign of status. Merrow speak their own dialect and the language 
of other ogres. 

Combat: Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide, 
becoming effectively invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on 
terrain. They attack from cover, so others are -5 on their surprise 
roll, Merrow typically attack with a large piercing spear (inflict¬ 
ing 2-12 points of damage) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit, 
followed by melee with talons and teeth. 

Habitat'Society: A typical merrow tribe consists of: 

1 chief, AC3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage 

2 patrol leaders, AC3, 5 + 5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage 
2-24 standard merrow 

2-24 females, AC5, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-6 damage 
1-12 young, AC6, 2 + 2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-4 damage 
1 shaman of 3rd level ability 

Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep), 
often with scrags (see Troll). They can live out of water for about 
two hours, so they often forage on land, Merrow usually control 
an area with a radius of 10-25 miles, hunting and foraging 
throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of 
treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal 
villages of man. Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often over¬ 
look dull magical items in search of glittering prizes. The goals of 
a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry mon¬ 
sters seek to completely control their ' kingdoms/' often leading 
to attacks on intruding ships. 

Ecology; Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no 
skills but plundering and murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes 
and seas where they have influence are avoided by sailors and 
fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who en¬ 
ter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their vora¬ 
cious appetites.

Half-Ogre 

When adventuring companies journey into the wilderness they 
often run into ogres: big, ugly humanoids. Occasionally an ogre 
party will include one or two individuals that are a little shorter, 
but significantly smarter, wielding a weapon with more skill than 
might have been expected. They have a better understanding ot 
their opponents, and they grunt commands that anticipate the 
adventurers' moves, In this way half-breeds, the issue of ogres 
and humans, earn the respect of their kind. 

Half-ogres range from 7 to 8 feet in height and weigh from 315 
to 425 pounds* Skin and hair color are variable, but tend toward 
brown, gray black, dull yellow (skin only), or any of the above 
with a slight gray-green tint. Teeth and nails are always orange. 
Most half-ogres have human-like eyes, though about one in five 
have the white pupils common to ogres. Their odor is noticeable, 
but it is not as overpowering as that of a full-blooded ogre. The 
half-ogre traditionally wears heavy skins and furs, bringing his 
Armor Class up to that of his ogre brethren, but rare individuals 
have the ability to make a shirt of chain-mail, for an AC of 3. 
Half-ogres speak common (more clearly and unimpeded than 
ogres), ogrish. orcish, troll, and one other, usually human, lan¬ 
guage* They live about 110 years. 

Half-ogres posses intravision out to 60 feet. Their sense of 
smell Is better than an ogre's, but it falls short of a human's. 

Combat: Half-ogres of any sort suffer “2 penalties to their at¬ 
tack rolls against dwarves and “4 against gnomes, since those 
smaller races are so skilled at battling bigger folk. 

Half-ogres in combat are often tound with lull-blooded ogres* 
If so, the half-ogre will most likely be leading the ogre party. The 
ogres fight more wisely when led by a half-ogre that concentrates 
assaults on characters it recognizes as spelicasters, and teaming 
up against skilled lighters. Ambushes are bet ter-planned and 
more carefully baited. 

To earn command privileges, particularly when ogre leaders 
are present, a half-ogre must show himself quick to battle and 
fierce in combat. Half-ogres’ usual weapon of choice is a huge 
sword (use the statistics for a two-handed bastard sword, save 
that hall-ogres can employ it one-handed, with a large shield in 
the other), or a war spear capable of causing 2d4 points of dam¬ 
age. A half-ogre inflicts an additional 2 points of damage, due to 
his mass. 



Half-ogres sometimes gather together to form their own tribes. 
In Lhis case, they will be encountered in bands of 2dl0 and will 
expend as much energy choosing and preparing an ambush as on 
the combat itself. 

For every five half-ogres in an encounter, there is an additional 
veteran with 5+3 Hit Dice, For every 10 half-ogres, there is a 
kader with 6 Hit Dice. If more than 15 half-ogres are encoun¬ 
tered, they will have a shaman, a fighter/priest with 5 + 3 Hit 
Dice and the spells of a 4thTevel priest, and two acolyte sha¬ 
mans, with 4+6 Hit Dice and the spells of a 2nd-level priest. 

Half-ogres are inclined to Intimidate others. A broad, fang- 
tilled smile and perhaps a slamming fist* often encourages an 
NPC to suddenly remember appointments, or perhaps faint dead 
away. Kobolds will dutch their spears and cringe in unison when 
7'6" of solid muscle smashes their door to splinters and storms in; 
even larger monsters have serious reservations about attacking 
hall-ogres. They will also terrify local human populations into 
leaving a half-ogre and his companions alone. 

Habitat'Society: Halt-ogres have no society of their own. If they 
live with ogres, they are the quick-thinking members of the tribe, 
ever on their toes to prove themselves worthy* If a half-ogre is 
reared in a human community, he learns to live with suspicion 
and fear, and often turns to a military or solitary occupation. 

Occasionally, half-ogres join with half-ores, orogs, ogrillons, 
and other humanoids. These communities are small (5-200 resi¬ 
dents! and usually isolated, but can appear in virtually any ter¬ 
rain. Half-ogres fill a middle niche—more powerful than 
half-ores or orogs, but smarter than ogrillons. trolls, and other 
humanoids. As a whole, these communities are chaotic evil, with 
neutral tendencies stemming from the level of cooperation neces¬ 
sary in a "half-caste" situation. They prefer others of their own 
kind, and are tolerant of ores and ogres. Enough of them have 
human blood that they regard humans with neutrality. Indeed, 
chaotic evil humans often find their most enthusiastic followers 
in such a hybrid tribe, They also tolerate monstrous humanoids 


274 








Ogre, Half 


such as trolls and giants, but ail other races art treated with un¬ 
disguised hostility. 

Hybrid settlements raid civilized territories for prisoners and 
loot, A settlement may be found holding prisoners, It is also 
likely tor treasure to be found in a hybrid camp. Half-ogres are 
usually cheated out of most of Lheir rightful treasure shares by 
the more cunning orogs and half-ores. 

Ecology; Sages have expressed much concern over the years, 
wondering why ogres can interbreed with humans but not with 
elves or halflmgs. When the actual answer was discovered, the 
sages' concerns proved unfounded. The explanation had nothing 
to do with any supposed common origin of humans and ogres, 
but rather in a unusual characteristic that ogres share with ores: 
rapidly adaptive biology. Just as ores and ogres can adapt quick¬ 
ly to any terrain, from forests to the highest mountains, their ge¬ 
netic construction allows them breed with any humanoid race. 

This ability to breed easily is frequently passed on to their 
progeny. Half-ogres can also breed successfully with most other 
humanoid races. If this process continues for many generations, 
the result is a horrible hybrid known as a mongrefmnn. Many 
mongreimen have strong strains of ore and ogre in their blood¬ 
lines, which may account for their chaotic evil attitudes. 

The half-ogre shares the ogres place in the ecosystem: that of a 
plague upon demihumans and humans, lusting for treasure and 
making neither crafts nor good labor. The beginnings of half- 
ogre poetry have been around for many years, but it is exception¬ 
ally ugly and disturbing, 

Half-Ogres as NPCs or PCs 

Half-ogres may be NPCs or even PCs, with DM r s consent. If so, 
they have statistics determined in the following fashion. Strength 
is Id-6 +13, with a roll of 6 being treated as 18(00) strength. Char¬ 
acters with a Strength roll of 5 (18 strength) should roll normally 
for extraordinary strength, Dexterity is 3d4. Constitution is Idb 
+ 13, with a roll of 6 being treated as an IS. Intelligence is 3d4. 
Wisdom is 2d6. Charisma is 2d4, doubled for effective Charisma 
with respect to ogres, half-ogres, ores, orogs, and other human¬ 
oids. Half-ogres reared outside of the tribes do not gain the lan¬ 
guages mentioned earlier. Player character half-ogres may not be 
exclusively priests, but may practice any other class allowed half- 
ogres. Starting Hit Dice are doubled at 1st level, progressing nor¬ 
mally at 2nd level and above. 


As NPCs, shaman half-ogres are fighter /priests. Also possible 
are half-ogres that function solely as priests, rising to 8th level, 
and rarely seen fighter/thieves (3+9 Hit Dice with the skills of 
1st* or 2nd-level thieves). Half-ogre thieves are always self- 
taught, and accept the following racial adjustments: Pick Pockets 
-20%, Open Locks +5%, Find ' Remove Traps +0%, Move Si* 
lently *5%, Hide in Shadows +5%, Detect Noise +0%, Climb 
Walls -30%, Read Languages -25% . 

Ogrillon 

The ogrillon is a fiercer species of the half-ogre, being the fruit of 
a union between ogres and ores. The ogrillon displays the general 
tendencies of its larger cousin with some exceptions. It is even 
more brutish and violent, and it normally learns to speak only 
ogrish and a handful of words in common. 

The ogrillon is the size of an ore, and closely resembles one. 
One in every ten is born with features and coloration very similar 
to those of ogres: purple eyes with white pupils, black teeth, yel¬ 
lowish skin with dull, dark green hair. The skin of an ogrillon of 
either type is covered with small horn plates, giving it a superior 
Armor Class and enabling it to fight without weapons. An ogrib 
Ion disdains armor and most other material items, retaining only 
a handful of gold pieces as treasured belongings. It is uncertain 
why they would keep gold, except perhaps as good luck charms. 

They love mayhem. In combat they disdain weapons and 
plunge in with both fists. Due to their great strength and horn- 
re info reed fists, each punch delivers ld6 + 1 points of damage. An 
ogrillon out of combat is restless and troubled, but it will be seen 
chuckling merrily to itself during a good fight. 

Because of their single-mindedness, ogrillons are often ap¬ 
proached by ores when they need good fighters against some ene¬ 
my. Ogrillons are happy to join and fight, sometimes for the love 
of combat and destruction, but often for more lucky gold pieces. 
In combat, there is only a 10% chance that a typical ogrillon can 
be distinguished from an ore. Ogrillons that resemble ogres, of 
course, dearly stand out, 

Ogrillons are the issue of a female ore mated with a male ogre. 
Thankfully, U is sterile. The union of a male ore and a female 
ogre yields an orog, a better class of humanoid monster detailed 
in the "Ore" entry.

There are many different varieties of ooze, slime, and jelly. More 
are being discovered all ihe time, as warped wizards seek to cre¬ 
ate life or fashion efficient dungeon scavengers. The unifying fea¬ 
ture of these creatures is a dissolving touch that consumes flesh as 
well as weapons and armor. 

Olive Slime 

Olive slime is a strain of monstrous plant life, closely related to 
green slime, that grows while clinging to ceilings. More danger¬ 
ous than green slime, olive slime favors moist, subterranean re¬ 
gions. It feeds on whatever animal, vegetable, or metallic 
substances happen to cross its path. The vibrations of a creature 
beneath it are sufficient to cause it to release its tendrils and drop, 
Olive slime ignores armor for purposes of determining hit proba¬ 
bility. It also negates Dexterity bonuses unless its target is aware 
of the presence of the slime and takes steps to avoid the stuff. 
Contact with olive slime causes a numbing poison to ooze from 
the creature. The slime then spreads itself over the body of its 
victim, sending out parasitic tendrils to feed upon the body fluids 
of the host. For humans and demihumans, the point of attach¬ 
ment is usually along the spinal area. The feeding process soon 
begins to affect the brain of the host as it changes the host's body. 
An unobservant victim must roil a saving throw vs. poison, fail¬ 
ure indicating that the victim has not noticed that the olive slime 
has dropped upon him. Any group of characters in the vicinity 
will have a 50% chance of noticing the slime s attachment with a 
casual glance, This percentage may be adjusted only by magical 
items. A thorough search by wary individuals reveals the olive 
slime without difficulty. 

Within 2d4 hours, the hosts main concern becomes how T to 
feed, protect, and sustain the growth of the olive slime. Natu¬ 
rally. this includes keeping the slime's presence a secret from any 
companions. If an affected character's companions become suspi¬ 
cious, or if they demonstrate any desire to destroy olive slime, 
the affected character will escape at the first opportunity. The 
host's food intake must double or the character wastes away 
(10% of the character s hit points per day rounding up, and no 
natural healing can take place while a character is wasting away. 
After ld6 + 6 days, the host suddenly and painfully metamor¬ 
phoses into a vegetable creature. The olive slime gradually re¬ 
places skin and muscle tissue, and it forms a symbiotic brain link. 


The new creature has no interest in its former form or fellows. It 
exists as a new species more akin to plants than any other life 
form. Feeding then becomes photosynthetic, paralytic, or, most 
likely, both. When slain, an olive slime creature dissolves into a 
new patch of olive slime. 

Olive slime is harmed only by add, freezing cold, fire, or by a 
cure disease spell. Spells that affect plants will work on olive 
slime, although entangle will have no practical effect, Green 
slime and olive slime are complete opposites—when they en¬ 
counter each other, the attack of one neutralizes the other. 

If an affected character has been transformed into an olive 
slime creature, there is very little short of a limited wish that can 
return him to normal. 

Olive Slime Creature 

Olive slime creatures, popularly known as "slime zombies" are 
the end result of the metamorphosis upon the host. The newly 
formed vegetable creature is linked symbioiicaily with the olive 
slime patch that created it. The symbiotic bond is a secure link 
within 200 miles, but not from one plane of existence to another. 
The olive slime can call its zombies to defend it from attack, and 
they will immediately and mindlessly obey. 

Regardless of their former existence, and despite their general 
form, slime creatures are only differentiated by size:

Slime creatures have a telepathic bond, effective at a range of 
200 yards, and gather together for mutual assistance while feed¬ 
ing or for defense. Their former identities can be discovered only 
upon close examination. 

Habitat varies from well-populated subterranean places to 
damp forests, swamps, and fens. Slime creatures are equally at 


276 








Ooze/Slime/Jelly 


home on land or in warm, shallow water. Slime zombies seek out 
animal hosts for their slime; they attack man-sized creatures on 
sight. When they attack, olive slime zombies have a 10% chance, 
per successful hit, to infect an opponent with slime. If they suc¬ 
ceed in doing so, they either change targets or flee combat before 
killing their target—they certainly do not want to kill the new 
host. 

Olive slime zombies are harmed by acid, freezing cold, fire and 
magic missile spells. Spells that affect plants will also affect them, 
although the effects of entangle are minimal at best. No other 
attacks, by weapons, lightning, or spells that affect the mind will 
kill a slime creature. An olive slime zombie, however, can suffer 
only as much physical damage as it has hit points, before its skel¬ 
eton collapses and it becomes nothing more than a puddle of ol¬ 
ive slime. When green slime is applied to an olive slime zombie, it 
neutralizes the olive slime, delivering 2d4 points of damage per 
round until the body is reduced to a (non-animate) skeleton. 

The vegetable intelligence of slime zombies is no greater than 
that of common animals, but does enable them to learn from ex¬ 
perience, This innate intelligence extends to the use of simple 
traps, and they will lie in wait at the bottom of hidden shafts. 

Mustard Jelly 

Mustard jelly originated when a young wizard attempted to 
polymorph herself into an ocher jelly. Her spell failed, and she 
became a mustard jelly The stuff has multiplied rapidly in the 
years since her accident, and it is now a serious threat in many 
areas, 

The monstrous amoeboid mustard jelly is far more dangerous 
than the ocher jelly. Mustard jelly is translucent, and very hard to 
see until it attacks. The only clue to its presence is a faint odor, 
similar to blooming mustard plants. Once it does attack, it may 
be seen as yellowish brown in color. 

Normally, mustard jelly attacks by forming an acidic pseudo¬ 
pod of its own substance and thrusting. The jelly monster se¬ 
cretes a vapor over a 10-fool radius. Those near the jelly must 
roll a saving throw vs. poison each round. Those who fail the 
saving throw became lethargic and move at half-normal speed, 
due to the effects of the vapor. The toxic effects last for two 
rounds and they are cumulative. 

This large creature can divide itself at will into two smaller, 
faster halves (movement rate 18), Each is capable of attacking, 
but has only half the hit points the creature had before dividing, 
A mustard jelly can, for example, flow into a room, divide itself 
into independent halves to attack, and then reform into a toms in 
order to surround a pillar its prey has climbed. Unlike the ocher 
jelly, mustard jelly cannot move through tiny spaces, nor can it 
move along ceilings, although it will eat through wooden doors. 
It cannot climb walls either, and so most of its bulk must remain 
on the floor, stretching up only 4 or 5 feet. 

Although intelligent, mustard jelly is not known to value trea- 
sure of any sort, except as a lure for greedy adventurers. Of 
course, it is possible that some treasure might remain after a vic¬ 
tim has been devoured. 

Mustard jelly is impervious to normal weapons (and can eat 
wooden ones) and electrical attacks. A magic missile spell will 
only cause it to grow; mustard jelly gains hit points equal in num¬ 
ber to the damage rolled. Cold causes only half damage, and oth¬ 
er attacks have normal effects. 



Slunjelly 

This relative of the gelatinous cube was designed by some 
forgotten mage to resemble a section of ordinary stone wall. 
They are usually about 10 feet square by 2 l /z to 5 feet thick, and 
somewhat translucent. If a bright light is shone on one side of the 
stunjelly, it will be seen on the other. Illumination equal to a con¬ 
tinuous light spell will reveal whatever treasure a stunjelly might 
be carrying, StunjeUies make no noise when they move, but they 
do produce a faint odor of vinegar. 

The stunjelly has many features in common with the gelati¬ 
nous cube. Like the cube, the stunjelly paralyzes creatures who 
venture too close! Adventurers walking near a stunjelly may be 
attacked by an anaesthetic pseudopod; those struck must roll a 
saving throw vs. paralyzation, Those who succeed suffer no ill 
effects. Those who fail are paralyzed for 5d4 rounds, during 
which time the stunjelly tries to surround the victim and digest 
him. Like the gelatinous cube, it is immune to electrical attacks, 
mind-influencing spells, paralyzation, and polymorph spells. 
Unlike the gelatinous cube, stunjelly is affected normally by cold 
attacks. 

Stunjellies reproduce by fission, as one extremely thick jelly 
splits into two smaller ones. This process is accompanied by a 
horrible, rending sound, audible throughout the vicinity. 

A stunjelly might mindlessly carry undigested metals around 
with it for days. These would include treasure types J, K, L, M, 
N, and Q, as well as potions, daggers, or similar objects. 

Stunjellies are tolerated in many dungeons as traps for unwary 
intruders, or as janitorial monsters sweeping the passages of di¬ 
gestible litter. For this duty, they are preferred over other breeds 
of slime and ooze, since they cannot slither through doors into 
areas where they would be unwelcome.

The oozes, slimes and jellies of the underworld are hideous, 
amorphous creatures that are the bane of all that lives, dissolving 
the weapons, armor, and flesh of their victims. 

Ochre Jelly 

This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through dark* 
ened corridors, through cracks and under doors, searching for 
flesh or cellulose to devour. Their form allows them to travel on 
walls and ceilings and drop on unsuspecting prey. 

Combat: The ochre jelly attacks by attempting to envelop its 
prey. Its secretions dissolve flesh, inflicting 3-12 (dlQ + 2) points of 
damage per round of exposure. While a lightning holt will divide 
the creature into one or more smaller jellies, each doing one-half 
normal damage, tire- and cold-based attacks have normal effects, 

Habita^Sodety: An asexual creature, the ochre jelly is a soli¬ 
tary beast that Is occasionally found with its own divided off¬ 
spring. It lives only to eat and reproduce. 

Ecology^ Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion and trash, 
this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean ar¬ 
eas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to orga¬ 
nize and is usually not appreriated by the inhabitants because of 
its danger 

Gray Ooze 

A slimy horror that looks like wet stone or a sedimentary rock 
formation, the gray ooze is rarely thicker than six or eight inches, 
but sometimes grows to a length of 12 feet, It cannot climb walls 
or ceilings, so it slides* drips, and oozes along cavern floors, 

Combat: The gray ooze strikes like a snake, and can corrode 
metal at an alarming rate (chain mail in one round, plate mail in 
two, and magical armor in one round per each plus to Armor 
Class). Spells have no effect on this monster, nor do fire- or cold- 
based attacks. Lightning and blows from weapons cause full 


damage. Note that weapons striking a gray ooze may corrode 
and break. 

Habitat/Society; After a large meal, a gray ooze reproduces by 
"budding:" growing a small pod that is left behind in a corridor 
or cavern. This pod takes two to three days to mature and then 
the little gray ooze absorbs its leathery shell and begins slithering 
about, searching for a meal. Sometimes more than one of these 
monsters are found together, but this is just a random event be¬ 
cause they are not intelligent,

Ecology; The gray ooze is a dungeon scavenger. It is rumored 
that metalworkers of extraordinary skill keep very small oozes in 
stone jars to etch and score iheir metal work, but this is a delicate 
and dangerous practice. 

Crystal Ooze 

This creature is a variety of gray ooze which has adapted to liv¬ 
ing in water. It is 7S% invisible when immersed in its natural ele¬ 
ment, It is translucent, mostly glassy clear, with an occasional 
milky white swirl in its substance. 

Combat; Crystal ooze strikes like a snake, then attempts to 
flow over a victim and exude its paralyzing poison, Unlike its 
cousin, the gray ooze, this creature does not corrode metal, but 
its poisons attack wood, doth, and flesh. Unless a victim success¬ 
fully saves vs. poison, he becomes paralyzed and will be con* 
sutried by the crystal ooze in a short time. When prey is reduced 
to -20 hit points, it is totally consumed. Crystal ooze cannot be 
harmed by acid, cold, heat, or fire attacks, but electricity and 
magic missiles inflict full damage. Blows from weapons Inflict 
only 1 point of damage per hit. A wooden weapon must save vs, 
acid or it will dissolve and break. 

Habitat Society; Crystal oozes live in any dim or dark body of 
water, though they can exist out of water for several hours. They 
reproduce by budding, like the gray ooze, but the crystal pods 
usually take seven to 10 days to hatch. Crystal oozes will eat 
their offspring, but occasionally if the body of water is large 
enough and food is not scarce, a few of them might be found 
living in the same water. 

Ecology; Crystal oozes are scavengers that leave metal and 
stone objects in their wake, so incidental treasure can often be 
found around and in their lairs, 

Gelatinous Cube 

So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, Lhese cubes 
travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash 
along the way. Their sides glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail, 
but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls or cling to ceilings. Very 
large cubes grow tall to gamer mosses and the like from ceilings. 

Combat; A gelatinous cube attacks by touching its victim with 
Its anesthetizing slime, A victim who fails to save vs. paralyza- 
tion is paralyzed (anesthetized) for 5-20 (5d4) rounds. The cube 
then surrounds its prey and secretes digestive fluids to absorb the 
food. All damage is caused by these digestive acids. Because ge¬ 
latinous cubes are difficult to see, others are -3 on their surprise 
roll. Electricity, fear, holds, paralyzation, polymorph^ and sleep- 
based attacks have no effect on this monster, but fire and blows 
from weapons have normal effects. If a cube fails its saving 
throw against a cold-based attack, the cube will be slowed 50% 
and inflicts only 1-4 points of damage. 

Habitat Society: Possessing no intelligence, gelatinous cubes 
live only for eating. They prefer well- traveled dungeons where 
there is always food to scavenge, These creatures reproduce by 
budding, leaving dear, rubbery cubes in dark comers or on 
heaps of trash. Young are not protected and are sometimes reab¬ 
sorbed by the parent. Treasure is sometimes swept up by a gelati¬ 
nous cube as the creature travels along a cavern floor; any 
metals, gems, or jewelry are carried in the monsters body until 
they can be ejected as indigestible. Items found inside a cube in¬ 
clude treasure types ], K, L, M. N, Q, as well as an occasional 
potion, dagger, or similar object. 



Ecology: The gelatinous cube is sometimes encouraged to stay 
in a certain area for its scavenging abilities, and is preferred over 
other jellies and oozes since its square shape does not allow it to 
slither under doors and into areas in which it is not desired. 

Green Slime 

A hideous growth, green slime is bright green, sticky and wet. It 
grows in dark subterranean places on walls, ceilings and Floors. 

Combat: This slime cannot attack but is sensitive to vibrations 
and often drops from the ceiling onto a passing victim. Green 
slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee rounds turns 
the creature into green slime (no resurrection possible). Green 
slime eats through one inch of wood in an hour, but can dissolve 
metal quickly, going through plate armor in three melee rounds. 
The horrid growth can be scraped off quickly cut away, frozen, 
or burned. A cure disease spell kills green slime, but other at¬ 
tacks, including weapons and spells, have no effect. 

Habitat Society: Green slime hates light and feeds on animal, 
vegetable, and metallic substances in dark caverns. Since it can¬ 
not move, this slime grows only when food comes to it. Sunlight 
dries it out and eventually kills it. Occasional huge slimes or col¬ 
onies of dozens have been reported. 

Ecology: Green slime is an infestation that all creatures avoid; 
it is burned out of caverns or mines if found. Once it has infected 
an area, it has a tendency to grow back, even after being frozen 
or burned away because dormant spores can germinate years 
later.

Slithering trackers are transparent, plasma-draining jellies found 
in many dungeons and other dark places. 

They are not invisible per se, hut are instead made of a trans¬ 
parent jelly-like material. Thus they are almost impossible to de¬ 
tect normally (only a 5% chance of happening to notice one). 



Combat: The unique nature of slithering trackers gives them 
the distinct advantage of being able to slip through cracks and 
holes as small as a rat hole. They move completely silently across 
a!! surfaces, simply oozing slowly over all bumps and turns. 
They prefer to attack sleeping, solitary or unconscious creatures, 
as their main weakness lies in the extended duration of their at¬ 
tack form. They secrete a paralyzing substance that immobilizes 
the victim on contact for 12 hours if a saving throw vs. paraiyza¬ 
tion fails. The slithering tracker then covers the entire body of its 
victim and slowly draws all of the plasma from the creature (kill¬ 
ing the victim in the process, of course). It can drain a man-sized 
creature in one hour. 

Habitat Society: Slithering trackers are solitary beasts. Since 
they possess no attack form capable of harming other trackers, 
territoriality is a question of first-come, first-serve. Being the 
most intelligent of all slimes and jellies, it would seem natural 
that slithering trackers would establish themselves as the leaders 
of the rest. But jellies and slimes lack both the means of commun¬ 
ication and the intelligence to band together. They remain on the 
lower end of the monster food chain, serving as scavengers that 
kill the weak and stupid, leaving the larger creatures for major 
predators in the dungeons they inhabit. 

In fact, slithering trackers often hide themselves in the lairs of 
large monsters, which are known to kill far more than they can 
eat at a sitting. The tracker waits until the beast goes to sleep or 
departs and then it sucks dry the morsels left over. Many times 
the victims are merely unconscious instead of dead—at least until 
the tracker gets to them. And on more than one occasion. 


monster-slaying players have left a hoard guarded by a comrade, 
while they go for help, only to return to find their friend mysteri¬ 
ously dehydrated, with all of the treasure still in the Iain 

Ecology: There are two theories regarding the origin of slither¬ 
ing trackers. The first and most likely one is that slithering track* 
ers are just advanced forms of the other jellies, fortunate enough 
to have developed a transparent plasma body and a modicum of 
intelligence. Like most jellies, they reproduce a sexually when the 
time and quantity of food allow for it. 

The second, more dubious theory, is that slithering trackers 
were created, not bom. Their high intelligence seems to lead 
many knowledgeable sages to believe that the creation of a slith¬ 
ering tracker is a hideous process, involving the transformation 
of a living human being. Certain legends seem to support this 
assertion, as there are many accounts of dark wizards removing 
the bones of their enemies, turning them into hulking masses of 
jelly-like flesh. While it is certain that no respectable wizard 
(good or neutrally aligned) would resort to creating such horrors, 
it is just as certain that there are many practitioners of the darker 
arts who have performed much worse experiments* 

It is possible that somewhere deep in the bowels of some long- 
deserted wizard's dungeon, there lies an ancient diary, with a de¬ 
tailed account of the terrifying curse of the tracker. 

There are tales of abnormally large slithering trackers that live 
in the deep recesses of the Underdark. Such monsters are often 
said to lurk around the edges of great underground civilizations* 
growing to vast size on the abundance of prey.

Ores are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band 
together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding. Ores be¬ 
lieve that in order to survive they must expand their territory, 
and so they are constantly involved in wars against many ene¬ 
mies: humans, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other ore tribes. 

Ores vary widely in appearance, as they frequently crossbreed 
with other species. In general, they resemble primitive humans 
with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Ores have a slight¬ 
ly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of 
a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those 
of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Ores have well- 
developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears 
that resemble those of a wolf, Orcish snouts and ears have a 
slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that 
sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim 
light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their opti¬ 
cal system, a pigment which gives them infravision, Male ores 
are about 5 l fz to 6 feet tall. Females average 6 inches shorter than 
males. Ores prefer to wear colors that most humans think un¬ 
pleasant: blood red, rust red, mustard yellow, yellow green, 
moss green, greenish purple, and blackish brown. Their armor is 
unattractive besides—dirty and often a bit rusty. Ores speak Orc¬ 
ish, a language derived from older human and elvish languages. 
There is no common standard of Orcish, so the language has 
many dialects which vary from tribe to tribe. Ores have also 
learned to speak local common tongues, but are not comfortable 
with them. Some ores have a limited vocabulary in goblin, hob¬ 
goblin. and ogre dialects.

Polearms are typically either halberds, pikes (seL to receive 
charge), or glaives. Leaders typically possess two weapons. If a 
subchief is present, there is a 40% chance the ores will be fighting 
around a standard. The presence of this standard increases attack 
rolls and morale by +1 for all ores within 60 yards. Ores typi¬ 
cally wear studded leather armor and a shield (AC 6). 

Ores hate direct sunlight and fight at -1 penalty to their attack 
rolls in sunlight. Their morale decreases by 1 under these circum¬ 
stances as well. Ores employ sniping and ambush tactics in the 
wild. They do not obey the "'rules of war " unless such is in their 
best interests; for example, they will shoot at those who attempt 
to parlay with them under a white flag unless the ore leader feels 
it is advantageous to hear what the enemy has to say. They abuse 
human rules of engagement and chivalry to their best advantage. 
They have a historic enmity against elves and dwarves: many 
tribes will kill these demihumans on sight, 

Et is often believed that ores are so bloodthirsty and cruel that 
they are ineffective tacticians and that they would rather be vi¬ 
cious than victorious. Like most stereotypes, this is highly mis¬ 
leading; it is true for some ore tribes but not for all. Many ore 
tribes have waged wars for decades and have developed a fright¬ 
ening efficiency with battle tactics. 


Combat: Ores are constantly in battle, They use the following 
weapons. 


Habita^Society: For every three ores encountered, there will be 
a leader and three assistants. These ores will have 8 hit points 
each, being the meanest and strongest in the group. If 150 ores or 
more are encountered there will be the following additional fig¬ 
ures with the band: a subchief and 3-18 guards, each with Armor

28 I 













Ore 


Class 4,11 hit points, and +1 damage due to Strength on all at¬ 
tacks, They fight as monsters of 2 Hit Dice (THAC0 19), For eve¬ 
ry 100 ores encountered, there will be either a shaman (maximum 
5th level priest) or a witch doctor (maximum 4th-level mage). 
Shamans and witch doctors gain an extra ]d4 hit points for each 
level above 1st and fight as a monster of 1 Hit Dio for every two 
levels (round fractions up) of spell-casting ability (e.g,, a 5 th- 
level shaman has d8 + 4d4 hit points and fights as a 3 Hit Dice 
monster.) 

[f the ores are not in their lair, there is a 20% chance they will 
be escorting a train of 1-6 carts and 10-60 slave bearers bringing 
supplies, loot, or ransom and tribute to their ore chief or a 
stronger ore tribe. The total value of the goods carried by all of 
the carts will vary between 10 and 1.000 silver pieces, and each 
slave bearer will bear goods valued between 5 and 30 silver piec¬ 
es, If the ores are escorting a treasure train, double the number of 
leaders and assistants and add 10 ora for each cart in the train; 
one subchief with 5^30 guards will always be in charge. 

Ore lairs are underground 75% of the time, in a wilderness vil¬ 
lage 25% of the time. Ore communities range from small forts 
with 100-400 ores to mining communities with 500-3,000 ora to 
huge cities {partially underground and partially above ground) 
with 2,000 to 20,000 ores. There will always be additional ores 
when the encounter is in a creature's lair: a chief and 5-30 body¬ 
guards (AC 4, 13-16 hit points, attack as monsters with 3 Hit 
Dice (THAC0 171 and inflict an extra +2 damage on all attacks 
due to Strength). If the lair is underground, there is a 50% chance 
that 2-5 ogres per 200 ores will be living with them. Most lairs 
above ground are rude villages of wooden huts protected by a 
ditch, log rampart and log palisade, or more advanced construc¬ 
tions built by other races. The village will have 1-4 watch towers 
and a single gate. There wilt be one balllsta and one catapult tor 
every 100 adult male ores. 

Ores are aggressive. They believe other species are inferior to 
them and that bullying and slavery is part of the natural order. 
They will cooperate with other species but are not dependable: as 
slaves, they will rebel against all but the most powerful masters; 
as allies they are quick to take offense and break agreements. 
Ores believe that battle is the ideal challenge, but some leaders 
are pragmatic enough to recognize the value of peace, which they 
exact at a high price. If great patience and care are used, ore 
tribes can be effecti ve trading partners and military allies. 

Ores value territory above all else; battle experience, wealth, 
and number of offspring are other major sources of pride. Ores 
are patriarchal; women are fit only to bear children and nurse 
them. Ores have a reputation for cruelty that is deserved, but 
humans are just as capable of evil as ores, Ores have marriage 
customs, but ore males are not noted for their faithfulness. 

Ores worship many deities (some who have different names 
among different tribes): the chief deity is usually a giant, one- 
eyed ore. Ordsh religion is extremely hateful toward other spe- 
des and urges violence and warfare. Ore shamans have been 
noted for their ambition, and many tribes have suffered because 
of political infighting between warriors and priests. 

Ecology: Ores have an average lifespan of 40 years. They 
have a gestation period of 10 months and produce two to three 


offspring per birth. Infant mortality is high. Ores are carni¬ 
vores, but prefer game meats or livestock to demihumans and 
humanoids. 

It is said tha t ores have no natural enemies, but they work hard 
to make up for this lack. Ore tribes have fearsome names such as 
Vile Rune, Bloody Head, Broken Bone, Evil Eye, and Dripping 
Blade. 

Ora are skilled miners who can spot new and unusual con¬ 
structions 35 % of the time and sloping passages 25% of the time. 
They are also excellent weaponsmiths. 

Orogs 

Elite ores, or orogs, are a race of great ores, possibly mixed with 
ogre blood. Orogs range between 6 and 6 Vi feet tall. They are 
highly disciplined warriors and have their own standards and 
banners which they display prominently—il is usually easy to tell 
when orogs are present among common ores. Orogs can be 
found at the vanguard of large ore armies, but rarely on patrol. 
There is a 10% chance that an ore tribe will have orogs, whose 
number equals 10% of the male population. (Thus a community 
of 3,000 male ora has a 10% dhance of having 300 additional 
orogs.) Small bands of elites (20-80 orogs I will hire themselves 
out as mercenaries. Orogs have 3 Hit Dice, plate mall (AC 3), 
and have a +3 Strength bonus on damage dice. For every 20 
orogs, there will also be one leader with 4 Hit Dice (THAC0 17). 
There is but one orog chief, who has 5 Hit Dice (THAC0 15). 
Orogs use weaponry common to ora, but will typically possess 
two weapons apiece. 

Half-ores 

Ores will crossbreed with virtually every humanoid and demi- 
human species except elves, with whom they cannot. The mon¬ 
grel offspring of ora and these other spedes are known as 
half-ores. Orc-goblins, ore-hobgoblins, and orc-humans are the 
most common. Half-ores tend to favor the orcish strain heavily, 
and as such are basically ores, although 10% of these offspring 
can pass as ugly humans, They are treated as humans with levels 
instead of Hit Dice. If multi-classed, they have these maxitnums: 
priest, 4th level; fighter, 10th level; thief, 8th level. 

If half-ores remain single-classed, these maximums increase to: 
priest, 7th level (Wisdom 15 required for 5fh, Wisdom 16 for 6th, 
Wisdom 17 for 7th); fighter, 17th level (Strength 18/00 required 
for 11th. Strength 19 for 12th, Strength 20 for 14th, and Strength 
21 for 17th); thief, llth level (Dexterity 15 required for9th, Dex¬ 
terity 16 for 10th, and Dexterity 17 for llth). 

Half-ores are distrusted by both human and ore cultures be¬ 
cause they remind each of the other's racial stock. Half-ores ad¬ 
vance in ore culture by flaunting their superior ability and in 
human culture by associating with people who don't care about 
appearance. Most tend toward neutrality with slight lawful and 
evil tendencies, but lawful good half-ores are not unknown. 
Some half-ores have split from both cultures to form their own 
societies in remote areas. These half-ores worship their own gods 
and (like most hermits) are extremely suspicious of strangers.

Otyughs (Aw-tee-ug), also known as the gulguthra, are terrifying 
creatures that lurk in heaps of dung and decay, waiting for some¬ 
thing to disturb it* There are two varieties, the regular otyugh, 
and its larger, more intelligent offshoot, the neo-otyugh. They 
feed on dung and wastes from other dungeon creatures 
(gulguthra means "dung eaters'') but also enjoy an occasional 
snack of fresh meat. 

Otyughs have huge, bloated bodies covered with a rock-like 
skin that is brownish gray in color, which is in turn covered with 
dung. They stand on three thick legs that give them slow ground 
movement but enable them to pivot quickly. They have three 
eyes on a leaf-like stalk that moves quickly from side to side, ena¬ 
bling them to scan a large area. The eye stalk is also a receiver/ 
transmitter for their telepathic abilities, Otyughs have a huge 
mouth with very sharp teeth m the center of their mass. They 
also have two tentacles with leaf-like ridges that they use to 
smash and grapple their opponents. The tentacles are covered 
with rough thorn-like projections. Neo-otyughs have smaller 
mouths than otyughs, 

Otyughs and neo-otyughs speak their own language, much ol 
which is non-verbal (movements of eye stalk and tentacles, or 
emission of certain smells}- they also have limited telepathy that 
enable them to communicate with other creatures. Otyughs reek 
of dung and decay. 

Combat; Otyughs lurk under piles of offal with only their eyes 
exposed. They usually attack if they feel threatened, or if they 
are hungry and there is fresh meat nearby. They attack with their 
two ridged tentacles, which either smash an opponent or grapple 
it. Grappled opponents suffer 2-4 points of damage per round. 
Otyughs' bite attacks gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll when 
biting grappled opponents, Otyughs smash grappled opponents 
to the ground, while the more intelligent neo-otyughs use their 
victims as shields, bettering their Armor Class by 1, Neo-otyughs 
may also force attackers to hit the grappled character with a suc¬ 



cessful attack roll of its own (vs. the grappled characters AO; to 
do this the neo-otyugh forgoes its squeeze attack. Characters 
with a Strength of at least 18 can struggle for one round and auto¬ 
matically break free: others must make a successful open doors 
roll to escape. 

Both types of gulguthra are disease-ridden: their bite is 00% 
likely to infect the character with a debilitating (80% ) or fatal 
(20%) disease. Otyughs are immune to these diseases. 

Habitat/Society: All gulguthra have Limited telepathic ability. An 
otyugh can communicate with creatures up to 40 feet away, while 
a neo-otyugh can communicate with creatures as distant as 60 
feet. Communication is usually limited to simple feelings and 
emotions such as hunger, temperature conditions and associated 
discomforts, its dislike of bright lights, and imminent death for 
its prey. Gulguthra also have infravision with a 90-foot range. 

Otyughs and neo-otyughs live in ruins and dungeons. They make 
deals with other dungeon denizens, agreeing not to attack them in 
exchange for their dung and body wastes, which they then devour. 
To keep the supply of waste coming (and to get fresh meat) they will 
agree to help defend their home against intruders, which includes 
many adventurers. Otyughs may be persuaded not to attack crea¬ 
tures in exchange for promises of friendship and food, Neo-otyughs 
are less trusting (and more vicious), and usually attack intruders on 
sight. An otyugh s dungeon allies will sometimes ask it to guard trea¬ 
sure for them. Most gulguthra live alone; 10% of the time, during 
mating season, two gulguthra can found in its lair. 

Ecology: Otyughs and neo-otyughs live underground in heaps 
of offal and refuse. They hate bright sunlight, preferring the com¬ 
fortable darkness of dungeons. They mate each year for one 
month, with one offspring produced. It takes the newborn Four 
months to mature (immature gulguthra have 3-5 HD, damage 
1-6/T6/T2, and a Strength of 16 is required to break free of their 
grasp). Otyughs are so disgusting that no alchemist or wizard 
would want to touch their components, so the corpses of the 
gulguthra have no known use or value.

Owlbears are probably the crossbred creation of a demented wiz¬ 
ard; given the lethality of this creation, it is quite likely that the 
wizard who created them is no longer alive, Owlbears are vi¬ 
cious. ravenous, aggressive, and evil tempered at all times. 

Owlbears are a cross between a giant owl and a bear. They are 
covered with a thick coat of feathers and fur, brown-black to 
yellow-brown in color. The 8-foot-tali males, which weigh be¬ 
tween 1,300 and 1,500 pounds, are darker colored. The beaks of 
these creatures are yellow to ivory and their terrifying eyes are 
red-rimmed. Owlbears speak their own language, which consists 
of very loud screeches of varying length and pitch. 

Combat: The owlbear attacks prey on sight, always Fighting 
to the death (ignore morale rating for purposes of determining 
retreat). It attacks with its claws and snapping beak. If an 
owlbear scores a daw hit with a roll of 18 or better, it drags its 
victim into a hug, subsequently squeezing its opponent for 2-16 
points of damage per round until either the victim or the 
owlbear is slain. The owlbear can also use its beak attack on 
victims caught in its grasp, but cannot use its daws. A single 
attempt at a bend bars/lift gates roll may be made to break 
from the grasp of an owlbear. Note that if the Armor Class of a 
victim is high enough that 18 is insufficient to hit, the hug is not 
effective and no damage is taken. 

Habitat .'Society: Owlbears inhabit the depths of tangled forests 
in temperate climes, as well as subterranean labyrinths, living in 
caves or hollow stumps. 

Owlbears live in mated pairs; the male is slightly larger and 
heavier than the female. If encountered in their lair there is a 25 % 
chance that there will be 1-6 eggs (20%) or young {BQ %) in addi¬ 
tion to the adults. The offspring will be 40% to 70% grown and 
fight as creatures with three or four Hit Dice, depending on their 
growth. They have hit points based on their adjusted Hit Dice. 
Immature offspring inflict 1-4/1-4/2-8 points of damage with 
their attacks and a character has a +20% to his bend bars/lift 
gates roll to escape the hug of an immature owlbear. 



An owlbear pair claims a territory of one or two square miles 
and will vigorously defend this territory against all intruders. 

An owlbear’s main weakness is also its greatest strength—its 
ferocity Because owlbears are so bad-tempered, they stop at 
nothing to kill a target. It is not difficult to trick an owlbear into 
hurling itself off a cliff or into a trap, provided you can find one. 

Ecology: Owlbears have a lifespan of 20 years. They are warm¬ 
blooded mammals, but lay eggs. They prey on anything, from 
rabbits to bears, to trolls, to snakes and reptiles. Owlbears prefer 
temperate climates, but some thrive in subarctic environments. 
As a hybrid of two animals, one diurnal and the other nocturnal 
they have an unusual active time, waking at noon, hunting ani¬ 
mals active during the day, then hunting nocturnal creatures be¬ 
fore going to sleep at midnight. Owlbears are active in the 
summer months and hibernate during the cold season. There are 
rumors of white arctic owlbears, a cross between arctic owls and 
polar bears, but no specimens have ever been captured. 

An owlbear does not actively seek treasure but the remains of 
victims may be found buried in shallow holes around an owlbear 
lair. Owlbear eggs are worth 2,000 silver pieces and hatchlings 
are worth 5,000 silver pieces on the open market. These are typi¬ 
cally bought by wizards* while they are impossible to domesti¬ 
cate, they make formidable guardians and wizards sometimes 
place them in locations of strategic importance (it has been said 
that an owlbear is a less subtle version of a 'keep out" sign}, 
Owlbears in dungeons and ruins almost always have been placed 
there by someone.

Pegasi are magnificent winged steeds that often serve the cause of 
good. These intelligent creatures are very shy and wild, not easi¬ 
ly tamed. They serve only good characters, and when they do, 
they will serve their master with absolute faithfulness for the rest 
of his life. 

A pegasus is a thoroughbred which resembles an Arabian horse 
(though slightly larger) with two large leathered wings. Pegasi are 
usually white, but brown pegasi are not unknown, and rumors 
persist of black pegasi- As should be expected, alignments do not 
vary according to color (all pegasi are chaotic good), Pegasi are 17 
hands tall (5 feet at the shoulder) and weigh over 1,500 pounds. 
Pegasi must be ridden bareback; they will not accept saddles. 

Pegasi speak their own language and can communicate with 
horses. They can understand common, and will obey their master’s 
commands if they are given in that language. 

Combat: A pegasus attacks with its hooves and teeth. It can at¬ 
tack an opponent who is behind it with its rear hooves, inflicting 
2-12 points of damage, but it cannot use any of its other attacks 
in that round. A pegasus can also dive at an opponent from 
heights of 50 feet or higher and use its hoof attacks; each attack 
roll is +2 and does double damage. 

In battle, a pegasus will try to lure larger opponents (such as 
dragons) Into tight spaces. As the opponent struggles to maneu¬ 
ver into attack range, the pegasus climbs and attacks with its 
hooves from above. Against creatures their own size, such as 
griffons, pegasi use their superior speed to outrun them, if grif¬ 
fons are close to a pegasus nest (especially if there are young 
present), one parent will attack aggressively, get the griffon's at¬ 
tention, and then fly away, By doing this, they hope to lure ene¬ 
mies away from the nest and tire them out over a long distance 
before returning home. 

Habitat Society: Pegasi are egg-laying mammals. If encoun¬ 
tered in their lair, there will be one nest for every pair of pegasi. 
There is a 20% chance per nest that there will be 1-2 eggs (30% 
chance) or young (70%) of 20-50% maturity. Each egg is worth 
3,000 silver pieces, while the young are worth 5,000 silver pieces 
per head on the open market. 



A pegasus can be used as a warhorse; a male can carry weight 
as a medium warhorse (220/330/440), while a female can carry 
weight as a light warhorse (170/255/340). 

Pegasi are intelligent creatures. They can defect good and de¬ 
tect evil at will (60 yard range). They use these powers on those 
who would ride them; they try to throw anyone of non-good 
alignments who would tame them. If provoked, pegasi will not 
hesitate to attack creatures whom they perceive as evil. 

To tame a pegasus, a person of good alignment must locate a 
pegasus herd. Then, at night, he can try to sneak up on a pegasus 
and surprise it. The character must have the airborne riding pro¬ 
ficiency. There is an initial +10 penalty to the roll; pegasi do not 
like to be tamed, A magical bridle enchanted for the purpose will 
remove this penalty. If the character successfully makes his roll, 
then the pegasus will be tamed, 

A tamed pegasus will obey the commands of its master for as 
long as it lives, if the master remains of good alignment. 

Ecology: Pegasi feed on grass, fruits, and other plants. Griffons 
and hippogriffs are the natural enemies of a pegasus. Pegasi have 
a lifespan of about 40 years. 

Greater Pegasus 

Legend has it that if a medusa is slain and beheaded, there is a 
small (5%) chance that a greater pegasus will be bom, springing 
fully bom from the medusa’s cloven neck. These pegasi have the 
same attacks and movement rate of a normal pegasus but are 
worth 6 Hit Dice and have 20% magic resistance. They also have 
a +1 bonus to their morale rating. There is a 5 % chance that the 
leader of a herd of pegasi will be a greater pegasus. Greater pegasi 
can be tamed only by the noblest and greatest of heroes, and 
have a lifespan of 100 years.

High above the mountains and rocky hills of most lands flies a 
sharp-eyed monster known as the peryton. Intelligent, patient, 
and malevolent, it watches and waits for prey—to pluck their 
hearts out. 

The peryton resembles a giant, dark green eagle, except that its 
head is that of a blue-black stag, its horns glitter as ebon as obsid¬ 
ian, its eyes glow a dull red-orange. The chest feathers of a male 
peryton are light blue: those of the female are drab brown. Pery¬ 
tons normally cast the shadow of an adult human being, rather 
than those of their own form* 

Perytons do not adorn themselves with trinkets, nor arm 
themselves with weapons. Their language is a collection of roars 
and screeches, and often sounds as it a peryton were either in¬ 
jured or enraged. Some creatures, with a keen sense of smell, 
claim that a peryton smells like a human, while others are filled 
with an irrational fear upon catching first scent. 

Combat: A peryton has only a secondary interest in prey as food* 
Its main interest in humans and humanoid creatures is the heart 
of its prey. It is unnaturally accurate in combat, In game terms a 
peryton receives a + 2 bonus to its attack roll, 

It attacks with its sharp horns, since its claws are too weak to 
use in melee. When a peryton chooses a target for combat, it 
locks itself into a duel that nearly always ends in either the pery¬ 
ton s death or that of its target* A peryton will never switch tar¬ 
gets during combat, no matter the tactical situation. On rare 
occasions, the creature can be driven off, but it will continue to 
stalk its prey, and return at a later time. 

Perytons are immune to all weapons but those of at least +1 
enchantment* 

Some perytons choose to swoop at a target* In this form of attack, 
the peryton climbs several hundred feet in the air and then plunges at 
the target, dropping with awesome speed. This attack is made at an 
additional +2 bonus to it s attack roll. If the attack succeeds, the 
peryton delivers double damage. This is an extreme maneuver that 
the peryton will only attempt if combat is going ptsorly, or if it be¬ 
lieves it has a chance to achieve total surprise. 



Another common tactic is for the peryton to seize a human¬ 
sized target and then lift off with the prey in its talons. The pery¬ 
ton climbs so rapidly that most targets do not react until they are 
at least 100 feet in the air and facing a 10d6 plummet if they man¬ 
age to escape the peryton s grasp, 

Habitat/Society: Perytons roost in caves high atop cliffs or on 
mountain peaks. They settle in nests of 2d4 creatures, each nest 
independent of any other, and no two nests being within several 
miles of one another, except for unusual circumstances—like a 
dwarven community in the mountains providing them with plen¬ 
tiful prey, 

Perytons sometimes take humans and humanoid creatures 
alive and hold them captive in their nests until they are needed as 
food (90% likely for nonhumans, 25 % the case for humans) or 
for reproduction (see below). Because of this, the peryton nests 
may have treasure scattered about, as well as Xd4 unhatched 
eggs* 

Ecology: The peryton is a predator, with no natural enemies (few 
could pierce its magically resistant skin). Humanoids, and espe¬ 
cially humans, are its selected prey A female peryton requires a 
fresh, beating heart to reproduce, and human hearts are the pre¬ 
ferred variety. Once a peryton has eaten a heart, its shadow 
changes into that of its normal form and the creature becomes 
fertile for 3d6 hours. 

Unhatched peryton eggs can be sold for 10dl2 gp apiece.

Phantoms are images left behind by particularly strong death 
traumas. A phantom is like a three-dimensional movie image 
filmed at the time of death, in the place where it died. 

The standard phantom may appear as almost anything. It of¬ 
ten appears as the character who experienced the trauma-a trans¬ 
parent image re-enacting the death scene. Alternatively it could 
represent whatever was foremost in the victim's mind at the time 
ot death: an attacker, or some goal left unachieved. Phantoms 
are experienced in faded colors, by all senses. 

Combat: It is difficult to fight phantoms, since they are merely 
images and have no power to directly cause harm. They cannot 
themselves be harmed. Swinging weapons or casting spells into 
the area of the image does not interfere with the projection, and 
they cannot be reasoned with. A phantom is not intelligent and 
does not exist for any real reason: tracking down its killer or 
completing its quest will not get rid of a phantom. 

Phantoms are often mistaken lor ghosts, haunts, or groaning 
spirits, but they can not be turned as undead, Only a priest spell 
remove curse , cast at 12th level, can dispel a phantom. 

Although a phantom cannot directly do any actual harm, it is 
the very essence of magic and calls up a superstitious awe in any¬ 
one who sees one. The enchantment is such that the phantom 
affects both the mind and the senses of the observer. Creatures 
without minds {such as undead) are immune to the effects of 
phantoms, as are those rare beings who are somehow unable to 
experience them (since the phantom is present to all senses, blind¬ 
ness is not normally protection against one). 

Characters witnessing a phantom must roll a successful saving 
throw vs. death magic, with a -2 penalty or immediately panic 
and run away as per the effects of a fear spell. Particularly vivid 
phantoms may require those who fail their saving throw to make 
a system shock roll with a +10 bonus to the roll Failure results 
in death for the unfortunate victim. Such a character can be 
raised normally, however. 

There are other difficulties with the fear effect: the cause of the 
phantom s death might still be around. Even after centuries, traps 
and undead monsters can be just as effective and deadly, and run¬ 
ning away in panic is usually not the best defense. 

Of course, a phantom may provide characters with important 
Information, either forewarning careful characters of an upcom¬ 
ing danger, or finding a lost and treasured object. 



There is a slight chance that a character's death may engender 
a phantom. This chance should be minuscule to nonexistent for 
0-level or very low-level characters, or for those who were ex¬ 
pecting to die-those dying of natural causes or in war. However, 
characters ol 4th level or above, dying suddenly or by surprise 
might have a 1-2% chance of becoming phantoms. If those 
characters were on an important mission or were subject to geas 
or quest spells, this chance might rise to 5-6 percent. The per¬ 
centage chance for generating a phantom should never be high¬ 
er than the level of the character at the time of death. 
(Characters killed by energy-draining undead rarely produce 
phantoms.) It is up to the DM to decide what the precise image 
presents, A character who is murdered and generates a phan¬ 
tom may also return as a revenant. 

There are nonstandard types of phantoms that affect only one 
of the senses. Often, these are purely visual images, but they can 
also manifest themselves as sounds (explosions, moaning, or qui¬ 
et whispering) or smells. Most of these phantoms require saving 
throws, but the effects of failure may differ, A gloomy whisper¬ 
ing of danger might produce despair (as per the symbol spells) 
effects, A foul stench might induce the reLching effects of a ghasL 
Suffocating pressure, temperature extremes, the sounds of a 
swarm of bats, might all carry different consequences of failing 
the saving throw. 

Of greater concern, however is that there are some phantoms 
that are actually evil, created when powerful evil creatures from 
other planes are ' slain ' (forced to return to their home planes) in 
the Prime material plane. These phantoms appear at the will of 
the evil creature 35% of the time, and can seriously misinform or 
endanger any character it meets. These phantoms can be detected 
with a detect evil spell; dispel evil can neutralize the phantom for 
a number of turns equal to the caster's level.

The phoenix is a great, extra-planar bird thought to represent the 
spirit of freedom and rebirth. It is a mortal creature that displays 
the ultimate in godlike detachment. 

A phoenix appears as a large bird with a 40 r wingspan and 
bright, multi-colored feathers. The plumage includes bright vio¬ 
let, scarlet, crimson and flaming orange. Its beak and daws are 
ot blue-violet. A phoenixs eyes are a deep, glowing ruby color 

In addition to its own language, a phoenix can speak with all 
avians. It otherwise communicates with a limited telepathy or by 
empathy. 

Combat: The phoenix is a free and benevolent spirit and does not 
derive pleasure from attacking others. But if the need for combat 
arises, a phoenix is a swift and powerful foe. It can attack in the 
air with two powerful claws inflicting 1-8 points of damage per 
strike. When on the ground it attacks with its great beak for 2-12 
points of damage per hit. The phoenix is an intelligent and magi- 
cal beast, however, so it usually opts for more effective measures 
of attack and defense, 

A phoenix will always open up each round of combat with a 
piercing shriek that gives the creature an edge in the combat 
round. All opponents of 12 hit dice or less within 30 feet of a 
shrieking phoenix receive a +3 penalty on their initiative dice. 
The shriek does not affect the phoenix's combat roles in any way. 

Every phoenix has the following spell-like powers, at 20th level 
of magic use, usable once per round, one at a time, at will: 



• fire charm 

• fire seeds l time per day 

• incendiary cloud. 1 time per week 

• invisibility 

• misdirection 

% neutralize poison , 1 time per day 

• polymorph self , 3 times per day 

• produce fire 

• protection from evil. 10' radius t always active 

• pyrotechnics 

• reincarnate, I time per day 

% remove fear, within a 10-foot radius 

• remove curse 

• snake charm 

+ veil, 1 time per day 
% wall of fire, 1 time per day 

Also, by spreading its wings and performing a ritual dance, the 
phoenix can perform the following spell-like abilities at 40th level 
of magic use: 


• affect normal fires 

• blindness 

• 

• blur 

• woodland beings , 1 time per day 
% color spray. 3 times per day 

• 

% control temperature. 10 # radius 
% Le . 

• detect c/iarm, always active 

• - 

% detect magic, alw ; 

% 'duo-dime ns ion, 1 time per day 
• ■■ 

* find the path. J time per day 


* dismissal 

* dispel eui7 

* dispel magic 

Any of these three abilities can be used by a phoenix as many 
times as desired, but can only be done one at a time and each 
takes a full round to complete. No other activities—such as a 
shriek—can be done in conjunction with these three powers. 

A touch of its wing is equal to a cure light wounds spell, with 2 
touches possible per individual per day per phoenix, A touch of 
the comb gives an effect equal to cure disease , but only once per 
day per person. 

When hard-pressed, the phoenix is able to cause spilled drop¬ 
lets of its own blood to act as fire seeds of the holly berry type, 
one being created for every five points of damage taken by the 
phoenix. 


288 














Phoenix 


In extreme situations, the phoenix can create a 40th-level com¬ 
bination of fire storm (20' high * 5' wide * 8' deep) and incendi¬ 
ary cloud, even if it has already used these powers previously. 
This destroys the adult phoenix but leaves behind a young phoe¬ 
nix with all the powers and abilities of its predecessor. 

The phoenix can travel astrally or ethereally at will. They are 
hit only by + 3 or better magical weapons. The phoenix can nev¬ 
er be surprised. It has infravision to 120 feet. 

Habitat Society: Phoenixes are strange and enigmatic creatures. 
They are held in very high regard in the legends of many tribes of 
barbarians and in other, primitive cultures. It is said that the phoenix 
is the embodiment ot rebirth. This U symbolized in the classic imag¬ 
ery' of the sell-immolation of the phoenix from which a new bird is 
formed. This is seen as the ultimate sacrifice for the cause ot good 
and thus the phoenix are considered noble creatures. 

Legend states that the phoenix has an extremely long lifespan. 
Some reports claim they can live to be over 1 ,000 years old, while 
others suggest it to be as high as 12,000 years. When it is time for 
the phoenix to die, it goes far into the mountains away from civi¬ 
lization. At the very top of these peaks, the phoenix builds a 
great nest made of straw and various herbs. The phoenix will lie 
in the nest, taking its last look at the world it knows. Satisfied 
that its work in the world is at an end, it then immolates itself in a 
flash of great flame and light. When the Barnes die down, there in 
the nest, which remains untouched by flames, is a young phoenix 
arrayed in bright colors like its parent before it. Legend then sug¬ 
gests that the phoenix must fly away to the temple of the sun and 
there bury the mummified corpse of its parent. 

In general, phoenixes are reclusive creatures, tending to make 
their lairs away from the worlds of humanoid beings. Though 
they have the ability to travel through the Astral and Ethereal 
planes (and thus to any inner and outer plane), they will gener¬ 
ally tend to stay on Elysium or in a secluded place on the Prime 
Material plane. 

There are as many legends of the phoenix as there are cultures, 
each with its own slightly differing viewpoint. Some believe the 
phoenix to be the benevolent symbol of death, only appearing when 
someone's time is up among the living. Other cultures—primarily 
evil—see the phoenix as the symbol of destruction and rage, bring¬ 
ing fiery devastation in its wake, Still other cultures record their 
phoenix to be a friend and benefactor of good beings, 

Although a wealth of mystery surrounds the phoenix, still there 
are some things that are known for sure. It is obvious that the phoe¬ 
nix is a champion of good. Although is seems these creatures do not 
actively seek out evil to destroy, they will rarely pass up such an 
opportunity when it presents itself. Also, despite the vast differences 
in ideology, belief, and philosophy in the various cultures that revere 
the phoenix, one thing remains constant: the phoenix is the symbol 
of creation by destruction. Some cultures believe that lire is the one 
great purifier, cleansing all that it touches. Others believe that fires 
merely destroys. With the phoenix, both are true. In its own repro¬ 
duction, fires destroys the old bird, taking with it many centuries of 
life and wisdom, yet ii creates a new phoenix with a new- mind, thus 
purifying the line. 


Ecology: Of all magical or enchanted creatures, the phoenix is 
perhaps most sought after by alchemists and sages alike. There is 
almost no part of a phoenix that cannot be used in a magical po¬ 
tion or for research. 

The feathers of the phoenix have a great many uses. They can 
be used to adorn a staff of healing, they can be used to make 
potions of extra-healing, and have many other healing, magic us¬ 
es, The eyes, beak, and talons of a phoenix are very valuable jn 
the open market, often commanding 5,000 gp and up Of course 
it is not always easy to find a buyer on the open market, because 
many cultures consider it a bad omen or taboo violation to kill a 
phoenix, 

The exact nature of the phoenix can only be guessed at by 
scholars. All phoenixes are male and the reproduction cycle con¬ 
sists entirely of the self-immolation. Whether this is a natural bi¬ 
ological reproduction cycle or a magical birth is unclear. 


Call Phoenix (Conjuration Summoning) 

6th-ievd Priest Spell Animal Sphere 

Range: 0 

Components: V, 5, M 

Duration: 1 round per level of caster 

Casting Time: 2 rounds 

Area of Effect: Special 

Saving Throw: None 

This potent priest spell enables the caster to actually summon 
a phoenix that will come and aid him. The most stringent re¬ 
striction to this is that the caster must be of good alignment or 
a druid. Evil or nondruid neutral priests cannot summon a 
phoenix. 

When cast, a phoenix will always come to aid. However, 
depending on how far away the nearest phoenix is, it may 
take some time for it to appear. One of these powerful crea¬ 
tures will appear in ld8 = l rounds. A modified roll of 0' indi¬ 
cates that a phoenix will appear right away in a huge burst of 
smoke and flame. 

Because the caster must be good or be a druid, there is sel¬ 
dom a conflict of interest between the phoenix and the sum¬ 
moned However, a phoenix will never attack beings of good 
alignment (unless there is an extremely good reason for it). It 
will* however, risk its own life if the cause mandates such 
action and will further the aims of good that the summoner 
has undertaken. 

When the spell has expired, the phoenix does not disappear, 
but it is then free to do what it will. This may in fact be what 
the caster summoned it for, or it may leave if it feels the rea¬ 
sons for its summoning were insufficient. 

The material components for this spell are three diamonds 
of at least 500 gp value (which are consumed by the energies 
of the spell) and a red hot coal.

Piercers resemble stalactites found on cave roofs. They are actu- 
ally a species of gastropods that, without their shells, resemble 
slugs with long tails, A piercer climbs onto the ceiling of a cavern 
and waits patiently; when it detects prey beneath it, it drops from 
the ceiling and impales the victim with the sharp end of its shell. 

Piercers look like limestone growths on the ceiling of a cavern, 
just like ordinary stalactites. They come in the following sizes: 
one foot long (2 Hit Die), three feet long (2 Hit Dice), four and 
one-hall teet long (3 Hit Dice), and six feet long (4 Hit Dice), 
Piercers can be identified on very dose inspection by a pair of 
tiny eyestaiks that curl along the side of the stalactite. 

Combat* Piercers have only one chance to hit: if an attack fails 
to score a kill, the piercer cannot attack again until it slowly 
scales a wall to resume its position. Piercers can hear noises and 
detect heat sources in a 120-yard radius; these heat sources in¬ 
clude humans. If the noise and light are stationary lor many min¬ 
utes at a time, piercers will slowly edge into attack position over 
the source of the stimulus. Piercers are virtually indistinguishable 
from natural phenomena. A group of characters has a -7 modifier 
on its surprise roll against a piercer (this guarantees that the 
group will be surprised unless it has some positive modifiers), 

A piercer, after it has fallen, is slow and fairly easily skin. Its 
soft underbelly has one defense mechanism; when exposed to air 
it covers itself in a corrosive acid which inflicts 1 point of damage 
on contact with flesh. This is usually enough to dissuade natural 
predators from disturbing it. 

Habitat-Society: While piercers are nonintelligent, the piercers 
in a colony are aware of each other, They often fall simultane¬ 
ously, to feed on those killed by other piercers (which makes the 
area suddenly very dangerous), 



Piercers dwell in caverns, where they live in groups of about 10 
members. They prefer to hang over high traffic areas, so they 
will usually be found near cave entrances. Aside from mating, 
the piercers are not social creatures. There are rumored to be 
great caverns deep underground that contain colonies of hun¬ 
dreds of piercers. Piercers are not attracted to treasure, only to 
food. 

Ecology: The piercer is a mollusk, hatched from a hen-sized egg 
which the parent lays in dutches of six to eight in isolated areas 
of the cavern. When they hatch, the young appear to be slugs 
feeding on fungi. After several months, they climb the cavern 
walls, secrete a chemical that hardens into the familiar stalactite 
shape, and then wait for prey to come. 

A piercer has a lifespan of four years and grows one Hit Die 
per year. In any group of piercers, the number of creatures with 
one, two, three, and four Hit Dice will be nearly evenly divided 
(e.g., in a group of 12 piercers, there will be three one Hit Die 
piercers, three with two Hit Dice, three with three Hit Dice, and 
three with four Hit Dice). 

A piercer can go without food for months, ft stores food in a 
second stomach that can preserve food for long periods of time; 
some alchemists seek out piercers to extract a substance from this 
organ and refine it for human use, as it can keep foodstuffs and 
precious ingredients fresh for weeks. Piercers also store large sup¬ 
plies of water, extracted from their victims. Piercers can maintain 
this water supply for months. 

The taste of a piercer h said to resemble that of a snail, but 
with a bitter aftertaste. Their eggs and offspring are not traded 
on the open market.

Of the many hazards in the wilds, these plants are among the 
most frightening. They feed on animals, perhaps as nature's re¬ 
venge on animals for their habit of feeding on plants. 

Choke Creeper 

The choke creeper, or strangler vine, is a long, thick vine with 
many branch vines, each capable of attacking. The vine is olive 
green in color, and the main vine is almost 1-2 feet thick. Branch 
vines have flexible tendrils, allowing them to creep at 5 yards per 
round. They are attracted to light and heat. 

For each 20 feet of main vine, it has the 1 bp per HD; branch 
vines have 2 hp per 20 feet of the main vine (branch vine hit 
points are in addition to those of the main vine, not part of the 
total), In each 10-toot section of the main vine, there are four 
branch vines. The smallest choke creeper is 20 feet long, has l 
hp HD (25 hp total h and has eight branch vines, each with 2 hp. 
The largest choke creeper is 160 feet long, has 8 hp/HD (200 hp 
totalh and has 64 branch vines, each with 16 hp. The main vine is 
AC 6, the branches AC 5. 

A maximum of four branch vines can attack a single target. 
They appear to be normal vegetation and can usually grab unsus¬ 
pecting victims. Victims can break tree with a successful bend 
bars/lift gates roll; it the roll fails, they are held fast until the vine 
that holds them is severed. Seized victims suffer ld4 points of 
damage per round, with a 10% chance per round (non- 
cumulative) that the choke creeper achieves a strangling grip. 
The victim dies after one round of strangulation. 

A choke creeper is immune to torch fire, but takes normal damage 
from hotter fires such as those caused by burning oil: hot fires make 
the vine move away. The creeper takes only 1 hp damage per die of 
cold damage, but cold stuns the all plant sections struck for ld4 +1 
rounds. Electrical attacks do no damage; instead, they double the 
creepers movement rate for ld4 + 1 rounds. 


Mantrap 

This insidious relative of the much smaller Venus flytrap attracts 
prey by scent, entrapping and dissolving its victims in acidic se¬ 
cretions. It is a gigantic bush with towering stalks of purple blos¬ 
soms, and huge green leaves at ground level. 

During daylight hours the mantrap releases pollen continu¬ 
ously; all creatures who approach to within 60 feet must make a 
successful saving throw vs. poison or become attracted to the 
odor. Those attracted proceed to the body and voluntarily climb 
Into one of the ld4 + i leaf traps on the plant. Once entered, a 
leaf trap doses, firmly entrapping the victim (no chance of es¬ 
cape). The victim cannot be pulled free until the plant is de¬ 
stroyed. Its acidic secretions destroy the victim quickly, inflicting 
damage per round equal to the victim s AC (discounting Dexteri¬ 
ty bonuses). Regardless of the adjusted AC, the victim takes at 
least 1 point of damage per round. Items exposed to the acid must 
roll a saving throw once per round against the effects; all metal 
items receive a +2 bonus. 

The fascination with the mantrap is so strong that, once a be¬ 
ing is enthralled, it takes 24 hours for the effect to wear off. The 
fumes from burning the plant counteract the effect. Because of its 
powerful attractive ability, the nectar of mantrap flowers is an 
ingredient in a philter of love. 

Retch Plant 

The retch plant, or globe palm, appears to be a typical palm tree, 
except that each always has ld4 + 4 globe-like, coconut-sized 
fruit growing at its top. Each globe is membranous, taut, and 
blue, violet, or lilac in color. 

Walking under a retch plant makes it 20% likely that one of the 
globes will fall. If there is solid contact against the tree trunk 
(banging against it, running into it, or climbing it) ld4 +1 of the 
noisome fruits plop down. Randomly choose the target attacked; 


291 





Plant, Dangerous 


they are AC 10 against this attack. When the globes strike, they 
burst, and a nauseating fluid is splashed over a 5-foot radius. 
Those 5-*&gt; feet from the impact have a 25% chance of being 
splashed. The sticky, foul fluid causes creatures to vomit and 
retch for the next three rounds. In addition to being nauseated, 
victims are at half normal Strength for one hour. No saving 
throw is allowed against either effect of the fluid. 

Creatures splashed must be washed in alcohol (including 
drinkable types} or they are more likely to attract carnivores in 
the area, doubling the frequency and chance for success of en¬ 
counter checks. The odor is discernible within a 50-foot radius, 
and it persists for ld4 hours unless removed as above. 

Snapper-Saw 

This plant, also called foresters' bane, has a central bush with 
several greenish-white berries that are plump, smell delicious, ed¬ 
ible, nutritious, and rich in protein. Several broad, dark green, 
ribbed leaves radiate out 5-7 feet from the bushy center, which 
hides ld4 + 2 tough, purple, saw-like stalks with thorny projec¬ 
tions. A healthy plant has six saw-stalks, while damaged speci¬ 
mens have less. 

Creatures stepping into the radius of the low-growing ribbed 
leaves risk attack. The leaves snap up one or two victims; armor 
is ignored for this attack, though dexterity and magical bonuses 
to AC are counted. A victim must make a successful Strength 
check to pull free. 

A creature caught by the snapper leaves is attacked by the saw- 
stalks, even if the victim breaks free in the same round in which it 
was caught. Each saw-stalk attacks once per round for Id4 + I 
points of damage, shredding the victim so its flesh and blood feed 
the snapper-saw. Clutched prey does not receive Dexterity ad¬ 
justments to AC though armor and magical protection apply 
normally. 

Saw-stalks are AC 4 and require ld8 +16 points of damage a 
piece to sever. Each snapper leaf is AC 7 and takes ld8 + 8 points 
of damage to sever. These hit points do not count toward the to¬ 
tal of the central bush's Hit Dice. The central bush is AC 9, but it 
is completely protected from outside attack when the snapper 
leaves are up, A victim held by the snapper leaves can attack the 
saw-stalks or the central bush, but only with small piercing 
weapons. Lost leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks unless 
the central plant is slain, 

Thoms linger 

Thomslingers are carnivorous, spidery, white plants with dew- 
covered. pale yellow' blossoms. They average about 8 feet in di¬ 
ameter and lie very dose to the ground. 

Thomslingers attack living creatures by firing thorns. Each 
thorn has a range of 30 feet and causes 1 point of damage. Since a 
large number of thorns are shot in a spread pattern at intended 
targets, being hit by one or more thorns is automatic. Damage 
from the thorns is 2d4 to any creature within 30 feet, once per 
round. They have virtually inexhaustible supplies of thorns, and 
are found in dose clusters. Since the shower of thorns is their 
only defense, thomslingers are often found in out-of-the-way 
places, such as pits or inaccessible caves, or growing on brick and 
stone walls. 

The leaves and central stem of a thomslinger are covered with 
a strong adhesive sap. Those who touch it are held fast if they 
have Strength 13 or less, until they are freed or digested. Charac¬ 
ters with Strength 13 or greater can break free in 2d4 rounds. 


Once a victim is caught by the dew, the thomslinger secretes di¬ 
gestive acids, causing 1-3 hp damage per round. 

Thomslingers are not very flammable, but flame causes nor¬ 
mal damage. Open flame is extinguished after one round and oil 
bums for only two rounds. 

Tri-flower Frond 

The deep green stalks of this plant are topped by trumpet-shaped 
flowers of vivid orange, bright yellows, and intense red; other 
color combinations are possible, but rare. 

Each flower has its own function. The orange one shoots 2d4 
pollen-covered tendrils, each 3 feet long; any creature struck 
must make a successful saving throw' vs. poison or fall into a co¬ 
ma for Id4 hours. The plants sensitive rootlets tell the yellow 
blossom where to find the slumbering victim; the yellow bloom 
bends over and shakes down a shower of sticky enzyme that 
causes 2d4 points of damage per round until washed off (damage 
is reduced by 1 point per flask of water; complete immersion in 
water removes the sap in one round). The red blossom extends 
tendrils into the victim, draining body fluids at a rate of ld6 
points of damage per round. 

Yellow Musk Creeper and Zombie 

The yellow musk creeper is a plant that attacks humanoids, 
draining Intelligence and turning them into yellow musk zom¬ 
bies. Both creeper and zombie are immune to charm , hold, i7/w- 
si on, sleep , and other mind-affecting attacks. 

The creeper is a large, light green climbing plant with leaves 
like ivy, ld4 dark green buds, and 2d6 bright yellow flowers with 
splashes of purple, It tan cover an area up to 20 feet square from 
its single bulbous root. Damage done to the plant is disregarded 
unless the root is attacked, for the vine eventually grows back 
from the main root. The creeper has a sweet, entrancing odor 
while dormant. 

Creepers are dormant until a creature approaches within 10 
feet; then the nearest flowers turn toward the prey and puff mus¬ 
ky pollen. A victim hit by the pollen must make a successful sav¬ 
ing throw vs. spell or be entranced and walk toward the plant, 
resisting all those who try to prevent it. When the victim reaches 
the creeper, a green bulb extends its roots into the victim s head, 
and reach the brain in two rounds. The victim loses ld4 points of 
Intelligence per round after that. 

A victim reduced to 0 Intelligence or less dies instantly; a vic¬ 
tim reduced to Intelligence 1 or 2 becomes a yellow musk zombie 
under the creepers control. If the plant dies before reducing its 
prey to zombie status, 1 point of Intelligence is regained per day, 
or a beta! spell will restore lost Intelligence instantly. If the mother 
plant is destroyed first, a zombie can be cured by a neutralize 
poison followed by a heal spell and four weeks of complete rest. 

Only man-sized humanoids become yellow musk zombies; the 
creeper can control one zombie for every two flowers. A zombie 
acquires yellow skin and a glazed look, but otherwise looks as it 
did before, wearing the same clothes and armor and wielding any 
weapon it had held at the time of its conversion. It has the same 
hit points as before, but attacks as a 2 HD monster. It can cast no 
spells, nor receive bonuses for high ability scores. The zombie 
can move up to 100 feet from the creeper. Yellow musk zombies 
are not true undead and cannot be turned. A zombie serves the 
creeper for about two months before moving off at least 200 feet 
and dying; the seedling that has been growing in its head quickly 
sprouts, flowers, and becomes a new creeper.

Like other breeds of dangerous plants, these are not at all de¬ 
fenseless, Some are the unnatural results of arcane influences, 
while others may Have evolved naturally. 

Hangman Tree 

This tree is named for its noose-like vines. Hangman trees are 
deciduous, resembling thick oaks with few branches and sparse 
foliage. Knot-like sensory organs are usually located high on the 
trunk. In the area where the tree s main branches split off, there is 
an opening which leads to the creature's acid-filled "stomach,' 
The lower trunk has a slash-like opening for the expulsion of in- 
digestibles. Saplings can move at 6 feet an hour, while older trees 
can move only 2 feet an hour. 

Their shallow root systems and small number of leaves require 
them to supplement their diet by direct ingestion of protein, so 
each tree traps prey. During freezing weather, a taproot is put 
down and the tree is dormant, 

A hangman tree can release a hallucinatory perfume at will, 
and it does so when prey is 30-80 feet away. Those who inhale the 
perfume believe the hangman tree to be a normal tree, or even a 
treant, depending on the mood of the tree. Mature and older 
hangman trees can speak halting Common. 

The tree attacks by dropping noose-like vines around prey. Al¬ 
though each tree has ld4+5 appendages, it can control only 
three of them at any one time. It takes IdS +12 points of damage 
to sever a vine; this is in addition to the damage needed to kill the 
tree. Vines are AC 5. while the main tree is AC 3. When in con¬ 
tact with a victim, the tree inflicts 1-3 points of damage per round 
as the vine tightens and lifts its prey {l,Q0€-pound limit) to the 
opening in the upper trunk. This requires four rounds. One at¬ 
tempt at a bend bars/lift gates roll can be made to break free: 


victims who fail the roll cannot escape. On the fifth round after 
being picked up, the victim is dropped into the hangman trees 
stomach. The victim suffers 3d4 points of acid damage per round 
until dead, and is then digested. Escape from the stomach is im¬ 
possible, Many sharp growths surround the top of the opening, 
they point inward and down. About three man-sized victims can 
fit in the tree's stomach at one time. 

A hangman tree draws power from its environment. It has 5 % 
resistance to magic per decade of age, up to a maximum of 95%, 
However, the tree is vulnerable to elemental attacks. Lightning 
that passes its magic resistance inflicts double damage; extreme 
cold shocks the tree into dormancy until it thaws. Darkness also 
causes it to slow its activities, so it functions at half efficiency 
(three attacks per two rounds!. 

Hangman trees have no interest in treasure and, because they 
move constantly, it is unlikely that treasure would be found near 
one, although they do expel undigestible items periodically*

Kelpie 

The kelpie is a mass of animate seaweed, able to alter its form to 
resemble a green-clad woman, a hippocampus, or a green horse, 
it lives to drown the foolish,, and can communicate telepathical- 
ly with those in its embrace. 

When a humanoid male approaches, the kelpie reshapes lo ap¬ 
pear as a woman or a mount; its imitation is a grotesque mock¬ 
ery, 95% detectable in daylight. Once per day however, the 
kelpie can cast a charm on a humanoid male, who suffers a —2

penalty to his saving throw. If he tails to save, he perceives the 
kelpie as a desirable woman or mount, leaps into the water, and 
swims on to possess the kelpie. The kelpie wraps itself around the 
charmed victim, who happily drowns, taking 2dl0 points of 
damage per round until he surfaces for air, is protected from 
drowning, or dies The kelpie takes the body back to her lair to 
devour. 

Victims who can breathe water or who otherwise do not 
drown, happily entwine themselves in the kelpies embrace, 
which confuses her. though she may welcome the victim s contin¬ 
ued activity, 

A kelpie in the form of a woman or horse can travel onto land 
for 1-3 hours. She tries to charm a victim to protect her until she 
returns to the water He will do anything he can to protect his 
beloved kelpie, though he may be enraged by his companions' 
perceived treachery. The effect of this charm ends, only if the kel¬ 
pie dies, freeing any victims still alive. 

Kelpies maintain body temperature equal to that of their sur¬ 
roundings. Due to their water-drenched forms, they take only 
half damage from fire (none if a saving throw is made). 

There are various legends about the creations of kelpies. They 
are said to have been created by a sea god to punish sailors, in a 
time before women were sailors; or created by a female elemental 
princess of water, Olhydra. who made those of her own gender 
immune to kelpies 4 powers. 

Kelpies reproduce by increasing in size to 7 feet , then breaking 
into two or four smaller kelpies. They can do this once a month, 
if victims are plentiful and the local fish do not feed on them too 
much, 

Obliviax 

Obliviax, or memory moss, is an evil black moss with the ability 
to steal memories, even memorized spells.lt grows in small 
patches and must have sunlight to spur reproduction by spores, 
though it needs no light for growth, it prefers a balance of wet 
and dry, and cannot abide cold temperatures. 

The moss senses intelligent creatures within 60 feet; It chooses 
one, preferring wizards, then other spellcasters. This victim must 
make a saving throw vs. spells or lose all memory of the last 24 
hours. The obliviax continues to attack once per round until it 
succeeds and then makes no more attacks for 24 hours. If an obli¬ 
viax with stolen memories is attacked, it forms part of itself into a 
tiny moss imitation of the creature whose memories it stole. This 
mossling remains attached to the parent moss and defends it by 
casting stolen spells. 

To regain stolen memories, a victim must eat the living obli¬ 
viax, which takes one round, if a saving throw vs, poison is suc¬ 
cessful, the eater regains all stolen memories and spells; it the 
saving throw fails, the eater becomes very ill for 3d6 turns. Extra 
memories and spells can be gained by eating obliviax which has 
fed on someone else recently, Spells can be used by the eater, but 
all such memories fade within a day. 

A potion of forget fulness can be distilled from obliviax, and its 
spores can be used to make an elixir to restore the memories of 
the forgetful or senile. 

Quickwood 

Also called the spy tree, this plant appears to bean oak, although 
dose examination reveals that it has a visage and sensory organs 
that resemble a distorted human face. It is 90% unlikely that the 
"face' Is noticed unless the observer is within 10 feet of the quick- 
wood, The creature has excellent senses, with 120-foot infra- 
vision and the ability to detect vibrations through its roots, and 
aerial movements through its leaves. 

The quickwood seldom moves, but it sends its roots up to 90 
feet, through loose topsoil, to seize and hold immobile any crea¬ 
ture weighing under 1,000 pounds. Roots cause no damage. They 



are too strong to be broken and take no damage from blunt weap¬ 
ons, and only 1 point of damage from piercing weapons. Edged 
weapons can sever roots, which are treated as large creatures with 
10 hp each; damage inflicted to the roots does not count toward 
the tree's total. The quickwood will allow up to six of its roots to be 
severed before it withdrawn the other ld6+6 to safety. The roots 
pull prey to the quickwoods mouth, which can damp down to 
cause 3d4 points of damage to anything touching it. 

The quickwood can perspire and drench itself, so it is immune 
to fire; it is immune to lightning, poisons, and gasses. It is also 
immune to most other spells which do not affect plants specifi¬ 
cally, including all mind-affecting spells. If attacked by a spell, 
the quickwood absorbs some or all of the spells energy, and uses 
it to radiate fear in a radius of 10 feet per spell level absorbed. 
The spellcaster must make a saving throw vs, spells; if the save 
fails, all the spell s energy is siphoned into ihe fear effect, Other¬ 
wise, the spell has normal effects, and fmr is simply a side effect. 

The quickwood can control up to 2d4 normal oaks within one 
mile, using them to gather information. 

Although it gathers no treasure. It may be charmed or other¬ 
wise convinced to guard treasure, which may be placed In the 
quickwood s trunk. If acting as a guardian tor some other being, 
a quickwood can make a hollow drumming sound which can be 
heard for a mile or more. 

Shambling Mound 

Shambling mounds, or shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting 
vegetation. They are actually an intelligent form of plant life, 
with a roughly humanoid shape, and a brain-like control center 
in its "chest ' area. A shambler has a 6-foot girth on its lower half, 
tapering to about 2 feet at its 'head.” 

Shambling mounds are found only in regions of dense rainfall 
and vegetation. Dismal swamps, marshes, and rain forests are 
their favorite living areas, but some wet. subterranean places al¬ 
so serve as shambler lairs. They are solitary beasts, rarely living 
in the same area with other sham biers—usually only In areas 

294 















Plant, Intelligent 


where the food source is constant, near famous ruins, or aban¬ 
doned gold mines. 

Shamblers are almost totally silent and invisible in their natu¬ 
ral surroundings; opponents suffer a -3 penalty to surprise rolls, 
A shambler often lies in a shallow bog, waiting for some creature 
to walk onto it, then it attacks. The creatures are excellent swim¬ 
mers as well, and they have been known to sneak into the camps 
of unsuspecting travelers at night. 

A shambling mound attacks with huge, arm-like appendages; 
a victim hit by both arms in the same round is entangled in the 
creatures slimy vines and rotting vegetable matter. Entangled 
creatures suffocate in the slime in 2d4 rounds unless the shambler 
is killed, or the victim breaks free with a successful bend bars/lift 
gates roll. 

Because of the vegetation which covers its critical inner body, 
the shambling mound is immune to blunt weapons, and takes on¬ 
ly half damage from piercing and slashing weapons. The creature 
is immune to fire, and takes half or no damage from cold, de¬ 
pending on whether it makes its saving throw. Lightning actually 
causes a shambler to grow, adding l-foot to its height, as well as 
1 HD and appropriate hit points, for each lightning-based attack 
used against it, 

Because of the location of its brain, the shambler cannot be 
killed by lopping off its head or limbs. The remaining vines along 
the torso join together to form a new extremity within one 
round. Only when enough of the shambling mound has been 
hacked awray, will it finally die. A wounded shambler need only 
rest in a damp clump of foliage to heal; it rises again in 12 hours, 
fully healed, and probably angry. 

Since shamblers gain power from electrical attacks, there are 
rumors of shambling mounds with 20 or more Hit Dice. Since 
they often live in the same areas as will-o'-wisps, there may be 
truth to such rumors, and giant shamblers may inhabit deep, 
dark swamps and jungles. 

Strangleweed 

Strangleweed is an intelligent kelp found in relatively warm sea 
water. A bed of these carnivorous plants are indistinguishable 
from normal seaweed. A strangleweed patch will cover an oval 
area of 3d4 square feet, on the sea's surface; 3d4 fronds of vary¬ 
ing lengths Qd6 + P teef» hanging downward from the patch* 

Any creature near enough is attacked, a hit indicating that the 
frond has entwined about its victim. Any victim entwined suffers 
a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Each frond has 4d4 Strength points, 
and the other fronds add their Strength to the total. A victim 
compares Strength with the strangleweed; Strengths of 18/51 to 
lS/00 are rounded up to 19. If the victim is stronger, each point 
of difference in Strength gives a 10% chance of escape, which can 
be attempted each round. 

If the frond is stronger than the victim, the victim cannot es¬ 
cape alone and the fronds crush the victim for 1 point of dam¬ 
age, per point of Strength difference. If the two are of equal 
Strength, the victim cannot escape, but takes no damage. 

Giant Sundew 

A giant sundew appears to be a 3- to 4 foot-mound of grayish 
green, tarry ropes or rags. The air around one is fly infested and 
holds a thick odor like sweet syrup. Preferring shaded places in 
which to grow r , the sundew has only hair-like roots that anchor it 



lightly in place. It can pull itself slowly along the ground using 
sticky tendrils. Due to the plant’s sticky exterior, missiles and 
fire-based attacks inflict only half damage. 

The sundew detects moving creatures by vibrations. When 
anything moves within 5 feet of it, it lashes out with its tendrils. 
Its body is covered with hundreds of tendrils, and a maximum of 
six can attack each creature in range, each round. The tendrils 
exude sticky globs of sap. For every three tendrils that attach to a 
victim, the victim suffers a — 1 penalty to attack rolls. The sap 
contains a mild enzyme that inflicts 1 point of damage per round 
for each tendril striking the victim, regardless of whether or not 
the tendril is still attached, A successful open doors roll breaks a 
tendril; each tendril must be checked separately, up to once per 
tendril per round. 

if a sundew's attack roll is an unmodified 20, it has struck the 
victim's mouth and nose, clogging them with sap; suffocation oc¬ 
curs in ld3 +1 rounds unless the sap is removed. The sap may be 
dissolved by vinegar or alcohol. 

Thorny 

Thomies are dog-like plant creatures trained as guards by mold 
men. They are covered by a spiky bark. A thorny attacks first 
with its bite; if the bite hits, the creature tries to roll its body 
against its victim, causing 3d4 points of damage with a successful 
hit. Thomies reproduce by laying egg-like seeds in the ground. A 
small tree sprouts from the seed, eventually producing buds 
which grow into small thornies, Thomies can be trained if raised 
from buds.

Poltergeists are the spirits of restless dead. They are similar to 
haunts but are more malevolent. They hate living things and tor¬ 
ment them constantly by breaking furniture, throwing heavy 
objects, and making haunting noises. They are often, but not al¬ 
ways, attached to a particular area. 

Poltergeists are always invisible. Those who can see invisible 
objects describe them as humans whose features have been twist¬ 
ed at the sight of horrors. They wear rags and are covered with 
chains and other heavy objects that represent a multitude of evil 
deeds that these creatures have committed against themselves as 
well as others. 

Combat; A poltergeist attacks by throwing a heavy object — 
any nearby object that a strong human can throw will suffice. It 
has the same chance to hit as a 5-HD monster (hence its adjusted 
THACO in the statistics given above). If the victim is struck he 
suffers no damage (treat the use of deadly weapons such as 
knives and swords as terrifying near misses), but he must roll a 
successful saving throw vs, spell or flee in terror in a random di¬ 
rection (choose available exits away from the poltergeist and de¬ 
termine randomly) for 2dl2 rounds before recovering. There is a 
50% chance that the victim drops whatever he was holding (he 
drops it at the start of his flight). Once a person rolls a successful 
saving throw, he is immune to further fear attempts by the pol¬ 
tergeist in that area. 

Those who try to hit a poltergeist but cannot detect invisible 
objects suffer a -4 penalty to their attack roll. A poltergeist is 
harmed only by silver or magical weapons. Sprinkled holy water 
or a strongly presented holy symbol drives back a poltergeist but 
cannot harm it. Poltergeists that are bonded to the area of their 
death are hard to dispel: these are treated as if they were ghouls 
on the Turning Undead table. Wandering poltergeists may be 
turned or destroyed by a priest as if they were skeletons. 

Habitat-Society: Some say that poltergeists are the spirits of 
those who committed heinous crimes that went unpunished in 
life. Whatever their origins, poltergeists are malevolent spirits 



whose activities can be anything from annoying to deadly Their 
purpose in existence is to haunt and disrupt the lives of those who 
still live. 

Poltergeists often haunt families and partnerships. In the latter 
case, they haunt their place of business, striking almost as much 
terror in death as they did in life. 

A poltergeist is often strongly bonded to a particular place, the 
place where its corporeal existence ended. Bonded poltergeists al¬ 
most never wander more than 100 feet from this place. A few are 
wandering spirits, doomed never to find their way home. Bonded 
spirits are stronger than wandering spirits (wanderers never have 
more than 3 hit points). 

Places where poltergeists are particularly strong have been 
known to have phantom shifts , These extremely rare and terrify¬ 
ing illusions take the character encountering the poltergeist back 
in time, to the time when the poltergeist was still alive. They of¬ 
ten reveal why the being was transformed into a poltergeist. 
Characters in a phantom shift may interact freely with the illu¬ 
sion, but any attempt to harm the illusion shatters it and returns 
the characters to the present time; likewise, any attempt on the 
part of the illusion to attack the characters also shatters the illu¬ 
sion without any harm being done. The illusion may continue at 
different times, or may repeat itself endlessly. No one can predict 
exactly when a place will experience a phantom shift, but they 
seem to occur on the anniversary of the poltergeist s death. 

Ecology: These spirits, which are terrifying and pitiable at the 
same time, do not consume food and do not collect treasure. Pol¬ 
tergeists dissolve when slain or laid to rest.

Puddings are voracious, puddm&amp;like monsters composed ot groups 
of cell colonies that scavenge and hunt for food. They typically in¬ 
habit ruins and dungeons. They have the ability to sense heat and 
analyze material structure from a distance of up to 90 teet to deter¬ 
mine if something is edible. Deadly puddings attack any animals (in¬ 
cluding humans! or vegetable matter on sight. 

All deadly puddings are immune to arid, cold, and poison. Light¬ 
ning bolts and blows from weapons divide them into smaller puddings, 
each able to attack exactly as the original pudding. Fire causes normal 
damage, as do wagfc missiles. Puddings can ooze through cracks that 
are at least i inch wide and can travel on ceilings and walls (falling on 
victims as a nasty surprise! at the same speed as on a level surface 

Puddings reproduce by fission. They are adapted to live in a wide 
variety of climates. 

Puddings starting with 11-30% of maximum possible hil points are 
3 feet to 4 feet in diameter; with 31-50% of full hit points, 5 feel wide; 
with 51-70% of full hit points, 6 teet wide; with 71-90% of full hit 
points, 7 feet wide: and with 91-100% of full hit points, 8 feet wide, If 
a pudding is split up so it becomes less than 3 feet wide, it becomes 
thinner but retains its 3-foot diameter. Because puddings do not use 
all of their mouth openings (which cover their exposed surfaces!, the 
smallest pudding does the same damage as the largest. 

Black Puddings 

Black pudding acid is highly corrosive, inflicting 3-24 points of dam¬ 
age per round to organic matter and dissolving a 2-inch thickness of 
wood equal to its diameter in one round, Black puddings also dis¬ 
solve metal. Chain mail dissolves in one round, plate mail in two; 
each magical 'plus ' increases the time it takes to dissolve the metal by 
one round (thus plate mail +3 takes two rounds to dissolve for being 
plate mail, plus three rounds for having a +3 magical bonus, for a 
total of five rounds} 

White Puddings 

These cold-loving creatures are 50% likely to be mistaken for ice and 
snow iguaranteeing surprise} even under the best of conditions. White 
puddings haunt polar regions or icy places in order to find prey, al¬ 
though they can live by devouring any animal or vegetable matter; 
even ice provides them with enough nutrition to exist. White puddings 
cannot affect metals but dissolve animal and vegetable materials in a 
single round, inflicting damage to flesh at an astonishing rate. 

Dun Puddings 

Adapted to dwell in and regions, these monsters scavenge barrens 


and deserts and teed on silicates (sand) if animal and vegetable matter 
is unavailable. They dissolve leather in a single round, regardless ot 
magical pluses* Metals are eaten at a rate half that of black puddings; 
chain takes two rounds to dissolve, plate four rounds, with an addi¬ 
tional two rounds per magical plus 

Brawn Puddings 

This type dwells principally in marsh areas. It has a tough skin but its 
attack is less dangerous than other types of puddings. Brown pud¬ 
dings cannot affect metals but dissolve leather and wood in a single 
round, regardless of magical pluses. 

Other pudding types are possible, at the DM's option.

Quaggoths are humanoids with long, shaggy-, white hair covering 
their entire bodies. They wear no clothing. Warlike and vicious, 
they roam the Underdark looking for prey. Drow sometimes en¬ 
slave them as guards and spider handlers. 

Quaggoths speak a halting form of Undercommon, and can 
grasp only simple concepts. More intelligent quaggoths may also 
speak a few words of Duergar, Drow, or Common, 

These aggressive beasts have infra vision with a range of 120'* 
They are immune to all poisons. 

Combat: Quaggoth tribes claim a certain territory as theirs and 
patrol it, hunting for food. Any detected animals or creatures 
(such as a party of adventurers! invite certain attack, 

Most tribes (70%) of quaggoths do not carry weapons, and 
attack with their daws for 1-4 hit points of damage per hit. The 
remainder of quaggoth tribes carry stone dubs or axes. Those 
quaggoths which are or have been drow slaves carry superior 
weapons, such as steel battle axes or two-handed swords. 

If a quaggoth is reduced to 25% or less of its original hit points, 
it enters a berserk fun 1 2 3 and receives a +2 bonus to its attack and 
damage rolls. This rage lasts until the quaggoth dies or all ene¬ 
mies are dead or out of sight. 

For every 12 quaggoths encountered there will be a leader, or 
jald. The jald has 3 + 3 Hit Dice and wears leather or skins, mak¬ 
ing it AC 5. In addition, it gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls. 
Jalds direct combat; if no jald is present, the quaggoths will fall 
upon their prey, whatever it is, in an unorganized manner 
Any quaggoth tribe has a 20% chance of having one or two 
thonots. A thonot is the quaggoth equivalent of a shaman. In¬ 
stead of magic, however, thonots use psionics. A thonot will use 
its abilities to aid the tribe in combat, escape, or healing. 

If quaggoths win combat, they take all bodies, including those 
of dead quaggoths, to their lair and devour them.

Habitat Society: Quaggoths are nomadic hunters. They change 
territories periodically. In each new territory, they claim a central 
cave as a lair, leaving treasure with a few guards. The rest of the 
tribe hunts, returning periodically to rest and change guards. 

Females are equal to males in numbers and abilities in a quag¬ 
goth tribe. For every adult quaggoth, there will be one young. 
Half of these young are unable to attack or defend; the other half 
have 1+1 HD and the same AC and attacks as adults, 

Thonots control what passes for religious life among quag¬ 
goths. They oversee what few rituals there are; those rituals 
which are known include the daily preparation for hunting, com¬ 
ing of age, and death (a brief whistling to send the spirit away 
before the rest of the quaggoths eat the body). 

Quaggoths can mate at any time of the year. They are not 
known to have any courtship or mating rituals. Young are bom 
about 10 months after mating. Births are usually singular, but 
twins are not uncommon. 

The origin of quaggoths is unknown* Some sages claim that 
they were once a semi-civilized race which dominated much of 
the Underdark through conquest and ritual sacrifice, until the 
drow, duergar, and other races broke their power. Others specu¬ 
late they had some sort of civilization on the surface and were 
driven underground; this theory is supported by the quaggoths 
hatred for surface-dwelling dwarves and elves, 

Ecology: Quaggoths produce a few artifacts, mostly crudely 
carved stone items. A few seem to be talented at making neck¬ 
laces with wooden, bone, or stone beads 
Quaggoths fear no creature. Though they are dangerous 
hunters, they are just as often prey for other predators of the 
Underdark, Quaggoths can be trained as servants and guards if 
captured early.

Rakshasas are a race of malevolent spirits encased in flesh that 
hunt and torment humanity. No one knows where these creatures 
originate; some say they are the embodiment of nightmares. 

Raksha&amp;as stand 6 to 7 feel tall and weigh between 250 and 300 
pounds. They have no uniform appearance but appear as hu¬ 
manoid creatures with the bodily features of various beasts (most 
commonly tigers and apes). Hands whose palms curve back¬ 
ward, away from the body seem to be common. Rakshasas of 
the highest standing sometimes have several heads. All rakshasas 
wear human clothing of the highest quality 

Combat: Rakshasas savor fresh human meat and use illusions 
to get it They have a limited form of ESP which allows them to 
disguise themselves as someone the victim trusts; the rakshasa 
uses this illusion as a lure and strikes when the victim is most 
unprepared. The rakshasa must drop the illusion when it attacks. 
Normally rakshasas can have magical abilities, up to the follow¬ 
ing limits: four 1st level wizard spells, three 2nd level wizard 
spells, two 3rd level wizard spells, and three 1st level priest 
spells. These are cast at 7th level ability, Rakshasas are immune 
to all spells lower than 8th level. An attacker needs at least a +1 
magical weapon to harm a rakshasa; any weapon below +3 in¬ 
flicts only half damage, However, a hit by any blessed crossbow 
bolt kills a rakshasa instantly. 

Habitat Society: Rakshasa society is bound by rigid castes. 
Each rakshasa is bom into a particular role in life and cannot 
advance. Females (known as rakshasi) are fit to be consorts, hon¬ 
ored only by their faithfulness and the fighting ability of their 
children. There are 1-3 females per male. 

Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose com¬ 
mands are to be obeyed without question. 

Rakshasas wage war on humanity constantly not only to feed 
themselves but because they believe that battle is the only way to 



gain honor. If confronted by humans who recognize their true 
appearance, they arc insufferably arrogant. 

A rakshasa s life varies in cycles of wild self-indulgence in times of 
prosperity and strict fasting and sacrifice in Limes ot trouble or be¬ 
fore battle, They are honorable creatures but will twist the wording 
of an agreement to suit their purposes. They prefer to deal with hu¬ 
manity by using their illusion powers to deceive and manipulate 
them, but are brave and forthright in battle. 

Ecology: As spirits, rakshasas are virtually immortal. They 
produce a new generation every century to replace the rakshasas 
that have been slain in battle. No creatures prey on rakshasas 
except those who would avenge their victims* Rakshasa essence 
can be an ingredient in a potion of delusion 

Rakshasa Rithks 

About 15% of all rakshasas are greater rakashasas or ruhks, 
(JbugftfeJ. These warriors are the guardians of a rakshasa com¬ 
munity. They are hit only by magical weapons of +2 or better; 
any weapon below +4 inflicts only hall damage against them. 
Their spells are cast at 9th level of ability. 

Rakshasa Rajahs 

About 15% of all rakshasa ruhks are rakshasa rajahs, or lords. 
Each rajah is the leader (patriarch) of his local clan. These rulers 
of rakshasadom have the same abilities as a ruhk, but also have 
the spell casting abilities of both a 6th level priest and an 8th level 
wizard, cast at 11th level of ability. 

Rakshasa Maharajahs 

About 5% of all rakshasa rajahs are rakshasa maharajahs, or dukes. 
Maharajahs have the same abilities as a ruhk, but have 13 + 39 Hit 
Dice, and the spell casting abilities of a I3th level wizard and 9th 
level priest. A maharajah is the leader of either several small, related 
clans, or a single powerful dan. Maharajahs reside on the outer 
planes, where they rule island communities of hundreds of raksha¬ 
sas, and serve as minions to even greater powers.

Rats are Jong-tailed rodents 5-12 inches Jong. 

They are aggressive, 


omnivorous, and adaptable, and they often carry diseases. Statistics 
in italics above refer to the giant rat. Stats without an italicized entry 
apply to both varieties. 

The black rat is about 8 inches long, with a tail at least that long, a 
lean body, pointed nose, and long ears The “'black" rat is dark gray 
with brownish patches, and a gray or white belly. It is a good climber 
(dimb 3) and jumper, but cannot swim. 

The brown rat, also known as the sewer rat or the wharf rat, is 5- 
10 inches long, and its tall is shorter than the black rat s. Its eyes and 
ears are also smaller, but it has a larger, latter body. Brown rats may 
be gray white, black, or piebald in color. They cannot dimb, but are 
excellent swimmers (swim 3) and bum&gt;wers. If rats infest a building, 
black rats inhabit the upper floors, and brown rats occupy the lower 
floor and the cellars. 

Combat: Rats normally flee anything bigger than themselves, but a 
trapped rat will do anything to survive and a pack of starving rats 
will attack anything in order to feed. Rats attack with their sharp 
front teeth and often carry diseases, so that a rat bite has a 5% chance 
of infecting its victim with a serious disease unless the victim makes a 
successful saving throw vs. poison. Normal rats fear fire, but brave it 
when very hungry. 

A swarm of rats can be treated as a single monster having an as¬ 
signed number of Hit Dice and automatically causing damage each 
round to small creatures in the swarm s area. A typical pack might 
cover a ID- * 10-foot area, have 4 HD, and inflict 4 points of damage 
per round. Weapons have little effect on a pack, but area effect spells 
and some other attacks (such as flaming oil) are effective. When the 
pack has lost its hit points, it is considered dispersed and unable to 
inflict mass damage. 

Habitat Society: The chief purpose of rats is to find food. Packs often 
burrow into and eat food stores. Rats nest almost anywhere, chewing 
doth, paper, or wood to make a nest. 

Ecology: Rats are very prolific, breeding three to five times a year. 
Brown rats produce 2d4 + 6 young per litter, while a black rat litter 
contains oniy 5-6 young. Both types of rats are omnivorous. Brown 
rats are considered to be more aggressive than black rats. Their teeth 
are extremely powerful; they have been known to gnaw holes in lead 
pipes. Rats have a lifespan of two to four years. 



Brush Rats 

Brush rats (also known as trade rats and pack rats) belong to a much 
less aggressive family of rats known as wood rats. They are slate gray 
above and white on their underbellies. They are nearly the size of 
brown rats. Brash rats build nests or burrows in forested areas. They 
are attracted to small, shiny objects and sometimes steal them and 
carry' them to their hoard. Pack rats are herbivores and will not at¬ 
tack humans. They do not carry diseases. Brush rats can be trained. 

Giant Rats 

These vile beasts plague underground areas such as crypts and 
dungeons. Their burrows honeycomb many graveyards, where they 
cheat ghouls of their prizes by tunneling to newly interred corpses. 
Giant rats are brown/black in color with white underbellies, and are 
related to the brown rat, with fatter bodies and shorter tails. As with 
normal rats, any creature bitten by a giant rat has a 5% chance per 
wound of catching a debilitating disease; a successful saving throw 
vs, poison prevents catching the disease. Giant rats avoid attacking 
strong parties unless driven by hunger or commanded by creatures 
such as vampires and wererats. Giant rats are tearful of fire and flee 
from it except if driven by hunger or magic. They are excellent swim¬ 
mers and can attack in water as well as on land, 

Osquip 

The osquip is a multi-legged rodent the size of a small dog. It is hair¬ 
less, with a huge head and large teeth. Most have six legs, but some 
(25%) have eight, and a few (5%) have 10. The creatures' leathery 
hides are pale yellow in color, 

Osquips build small, carefully hidden tunnels, and their teeth are 
sharp enough to dig through stone. If someone enters an area in 
which there are osquip tunnels, the creatures can emerge quickly and 
opponents receive a -5 to surprise rolls. The osquip are territorial 
and attack fearlessly and ferociously. Osquips are not afraid of fire, 
but are poor swimmers {50% drown, 50% paddle with a movement 
rate of 1). 

Osquips are difficult to domesticate, but jermlaine and a few wiz¬ 
ards have succeeded by giving the creatures gems, for they collect 
shiny objects. Gsquip leather is soft and water-resistant, and their 
teeth can be used in digging magic.

Remorhaz, sometimes known as polar worms T inhabit only chill 
arctic wastes. They are very aggressive predators that devour 
any animal matter, including humans, demihumans, and human- 
oids: they have even been known to attack frost giants. 

A remorhaz has a segmented body with a winged head and 
neck, standing on dozens of chitinous legs, Remorhaz have an ice 
blue color everywhere except on their backs, where a streak of 
white sets off the many protrusions located there. The size of a 
remorhaz is determined by its Hit Dice: a 7 Hit Dice remorhaz is 
21 feet long, an S Hit Dice creature is 24 feet long, etc. Their lan¬ 
guage consists of roaring, bellowing, and howling. 

Combat: In combat the remorhaz beats its small wings, raising 
up the front quarter of its body. It then snaps itself forward, strik¬ 
ing with blinding speed. They are able to swallow prey whole on 
an unmodified attack roll of 20; any victim swallowed is killed 
instantly by the intense heat inside the creature. When aroused, 
the remorhaz secretes a substance that causes its intestines to be¬ 
come very hot and its back protrusions actually glow cherry red 
from excess heat. Any nonmagical weapon melts from contact 
with its back and any creature touched by these surfaces suffers 
10-100 points of damage. 

To determine where a blow has struck a remorhaz. consider 
where the attacker is in respect to the remorhaz. While the re¬ 
morhaz is rearing to attack, a blow from the front hits the rela¬ 
tively soft underbelly. When the remorhaz is attacking a 
creature, any blow inflicted hits the head unless the underside is 
specifically stated as the object of the attack, In all other cases, 
the body is the object of the attack, subject to adjudication by the 
DM. 

Remorhaz are slower than most polar dwellers, so they prefer 
to burrow into the snow and surface when they hear prey nearby 
hoping to achieve surprise. Remorhaz have Infra vision to 60 feet. 



Habitat Society: A remorhaz lair usually consists of a number 
of large, smoothly rounded tunnels in ice and snow or rock, 
gradually descending to a large central chamber. Tunnels in ice 
and snow will be very slippery, as the remorhazs hot back re¬ 
peatedly melts the snow, leaving it to refreeze. The central cham¬ 
ber is only about twice the size of a remorhaz, while the central 
chamber of a nesting pair is about four times their size and may 
contain icy stalactites, 

Remorhaz have a hunting range of 60 miles. Except where the 
game has been hunted to extinction, these creatures tolerate the 
presence of other remorhaz in their hunting grounds. 

Ecology: Remorhaz are carnivores, sustaining themselves with 
a diet of deer, elk, and even polar bears. They mate in late sum¬ 
mer and stay together for two months before departing to live 
solitary existences. Remorhaz mate every year but can produce 
offspring only three or four times in a lifetime; the female lays a 
clutch of one or two grey-blue eggs, remaining with the eggs at all 
times, coiling around them to keep them warm; if the eggs are left 
in the freezing cold for only one minute, they will never hatch. 
Young remorhaz have 1 Hit Die at birth and grow to 7 Hit Dice 
after four months, when they leave the nest . Immature remorhaz 
have weaker armor (+2 AC in all locations); 1-3 Hit Dice re¬ 
morhaz can only bite for 2-12 points of damage, while 4-6 Hit 
Dice creatures inflict 3-18 points of damage. From birth, the 
young remorhaz have all the powers of an adult, 

Remorhaz have lifespans of 30 years. Their eggs are valued at 
500 gold pieces and are eagerly sought because these creatures 
can be trained to be excellent guards. However, a remorhaz can 
be trained to obey only one or two masters, and will attack its 
master if hungry enough. The heat secretion of a rhemorhaz, 
thrym, is valuable as a component for heat-related magical items 
and can be sold to alchemists for 5-10 gold pieces per flask. The 
remorhaz will contain 10 flasks worth of thrym per Hit Die,

Revenants are vengeful spirits that have risen from the grave to 
destroy their killers. 

The revenant appears as a spectral, decayed version of its ap¬ 
pearance at the time of its death. Its pallid skin is drawn tightly 
over its bones. The flesh is cold and clammy. The sunken eyes are 
dull and heavy-lidded but, when the revenant faces his intended 
victim, the eyes blaze with unnatural intensity. The revenant 
bears an aura of sadness, anger, and determination. 

Combat; A revenant attacks by hooking its daw-like hands 
around its victim's throat. This strangulation causes 2dS points of 
damage each round. It will not release its grip until either the re¬ 
venant is destroyed or its victim is dead. It never uses weapons. 

If the revenant stares into its victim s eyes, that person must 
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be paralyzed with ter¬ 
ror for 2d4 rounds, This power affects only the revenant's killer. 

If a revenant is dismembered, the severed parts act indepen¬ 
dently, as though guided by the revenant's mind. The revenanis 
willpower causes the parts to reunite. It can also regenerate 3 hit 
points of damage each round, except for fire damage. It is im¬ 
mune to acid and gas. Although a revenant's body can be cut 
apart by normal or magical weapons, the damage is temporary 
and does not destroy the revenant. Only burning destroys a 
revenant—the original body must be completely consumed and 
reduced to ash. 

Although it is undead, the revenant is motivated entirely by 
self-will. Therefore, as it ts not inherently evil, it is not affected 
by holy water, holy/unholy symbols, or other religious para¬ 
phernalia. It cannot be turned by priests nor can it he raised or 
resurrected. 

Habitat Society: Under exceptional circumstances, a character 
who has died a violent death may rise as a revenant from the 
grave to wreak vengeance on his killer(s). In order to make this 
transition, two requirements must be met. The dead character's 
Constitution must be 13 and either his Wisdom or Intelligence 
must be greater than 16. Also, the total of his six ability scores 
must be 90 or more. Even if these conditions are met, there is 
only a 5% chance that the dead character becomes a revenant. 

If both Intelligence and Wisdom are over 16, the chance in¬ 
creases to 10%. If Intelligence, Wisdom, and Constitution are all 
IS, the creature can shift at will into any freshly killed humanoid, 
if the revenant rolls a successful saving throw vs. death. 



If the character died a particularly violent death, it may be un¬ 
able to reoccupy its original body. In this case, the spirit occupies 
any available, freshiy-dead corpse. However, the revenants 
killer and associates always see the revenant as the person they 
killed* 

The revenant retains all the abilities it possessed in its previous 
life and has at least the hit points and saving throws of an S-Hit 
Die creature. Its alignment is neutral, regardless ot its alignment 
in life. It can converse fluently in its original language, although 
the stiffness of its vocal cords deters it from speaking except un¬ 
der extreme circumstances, such as when casting a spell at its 
killer. 

The sole purpose of the revenant's brief existence is to wreak 
vengeance on Its killer, together with anyone who may have aid¬ 
ed in the murder. It stops at nothing to achieve its purpose and 
can locate its intended victim wherever he may be. Accomplices 
are also tracked down if they are in the company of the killer, but 
if they are elsewhere they are ignored until the killer is dealt with, 
If the associates of the killer are with him in a party, they are dealt 
with after the killer is dead. 

The revenant's body does decay, though at a slower rate than 
normal. Within three to six months, the corpse decomposes rap¬ 
idly and the revenants spirit returns to the plane from which it 
came. When the revenant has completed its mission, the body 
immediately disintegrates and its spirit finally rests in peace. 

A revenant does not attack innocents except In self-defense. If 
necessary, the revenant can use cunning to get to its prey. 

Ecology: Revenants give murder victims a chance to avenge 
their own murders, They pursue their goals alone without desire 
or need for allies. However, if the revenant faces a powerful foe 
able to destroy the revenant s new form, the revenant may decide 
to use adventurers as pawns in its quest.

Looking almost too big to be real, rocs are huge birds of prey that 
dwell in warm mountainous regions and are known for carrying 
off large animals (cattle, horses, elephants) for food. 

Rocs resemble large eagles, with either dark brown plumage or 
all golden feathers from head to tail. In a few rare instances, rocs 
of all red, black or white are sighted, but such sightings are often 
considered bad omens. These giant birds are 60 feet long from 
beak to tail feathers, with wingspans as wide as 120 feet. 

Combat: The roc swoops down upon prey seizes it in powerful 
talons, and carries it off to the rocs lair to be devoured at leisure. 
The resulting damage is 3d6 per claw. Most of the time (95%), a 
roc carries off its prey only if both claws hit. If the prey was hit 
by only one claw r the roc usually lets go, then turns around and 
attempts another grab. Once the prey has been secured, the roc 
flies back to its nest. If the creature resists, the roc strikes with its 
beak, inflicting 4d6 points of damage per hit. 

Should a human, humanoid, or demihuman be captured, 
there is a 65% chance that the victim s arms are both pinned to 
his sides, making impossible melee weapon attacks or spellcast¬ 
ing that requires hand gestures. A roc will let go of its prey if it 
suffers damage equal to a quarter of its hit points. A roc can 
pick up two targets simultaneously if they are within 10 feet of 
each other. 

A roc usually cruises at a height of about 300 feet, seeking out 
likely prey with its sharp eyes. When a good target is found, it 
swoops down silently. The stealth of this first attack imposes a -5 
penalty to its opponents" surprise rolls. 

Habitat Society: Roc lairs are vast nests made of t rees, branch¬ 
es, and the like. They inhabit the highest mountains in warm re¬ 
gions, Rocs are not given to nesting dose to each other, with a 
nest rarely being located within 20 miles of another nest. There is 
a 15% chance of finding ld4 +1 eggs in a roc nest. These eggs sell 
for 2d6 x 100 gp to merchants specializing in exotic items. As may 
be expected, rocs fight to the death to protect these nests and 
their contents, gaining a +1 bonus to their attack roll. 



The treasure of a roc is usually strewn about and below the 
nest for the creature does not value such. It is the residue from its 
victims, Tf the roc has been seizing pack horses and mules, some 
of that treasure may be merchant s w-ares such as spkes, rugs, 
tapestries, perfume, rich clothing, or jewels. 

The roc ranges for food three times a day; about an hour after 
sunrise, at noon, and an hour before sunset, if there are young in 
the nest, a fourth feeding, approximately two hours after noon, 
is added to keep the young strong and well-fed. 

Ecology: Rocs are occasionally tamed and used by cloud or 
storm giants. Good-aligned giants do not allow their rocs to at¬ 
tack civilized areas and the animals therein. 

As mentioned before, rocs do not nest too closely together, 
since such a high concentration of these hungry predators would 
deprive entire regions of its animal population. Rocs serve to 
keep down the number of large predators, as they are fond of 
ankheg, purple worms, and harpies. Thanks to the rocs' prodi¬ 
gious appetites, these creatures are not swarming about with im¬ 
punity. 

It is said that roc feathers can be used in the manufacture of 
Qwijafs feather tokens, as well as uimgs and brooms of flying. 
One race that has little love for rocs is dwarves, Dwarven 
mines located in remote mountains often have to contend with 
unruly rocs intent on protecting their territory. Attempts by the 
dwarves to tame rocs have all met with failure, so the accepted 
manner of dealing with rocs is to kill them and smash their eggs. 
Adventurers who happen on a community of mountain dwarves 
may find employment as roc hunters. Such groups would do well 
not to allow any druids to find this out.

A roper resembles a rocky outcropping. The creatures hide is 
yellowish gray and rough and its body very malleable. They are 
usually pilbr-Itke in shape, 9 feet tall about 3 feet in diameter at 
the base, and about 1 foot in diameter at the top. The roper has a 
single yellow eye. and a maw ringed with sharp teeth. Halfway 
up its body are small bumps which are the sources of the strands 
it fires at opponents (see below). Ropers have the same body tem¬ 
perature as their surroundings. 


Combat: A roper can stand upright to resemble a stalagmite, lie 
on the ground to imitate a boulder, or even flatten itself to look 
like a lump on a cavern floor. They can change color a little, 
enough to blend into rocky backgrounds. Opponents suffer a -2 
penalty to surprise rolls when faced by a roper. 

Ropers attack by shooting strong, sticky strands at opponents. 
They can shoot a total of six strands, one per round, as far as 50 
feet: each strand can extend (ld4 +1) x xc feet and pull up to 750 
pounds. Each time a strand hits (requiring a normal attack roll) 
the victim must make a successful saving throw vs* poison or lose 
half its Strength (round fractions down). Strength loss occurs Id3 
round after a hit, is cumulative for multiple hits, and lasts for 2d4 
turns. 

If a roper s prey cannot break Iree, it is pulled 10 feet closer per 
round; when it reaches the roper, the creature bites the victim for 
5d4 points of damage (automatic hit against a victim held by a 
strand). A strand can be pulled off or broken by a character who 
makes a successful open doors roll. A strand can also be cut; it is 
AC 0, and it must take at least 6 points damage from a single hit 
of an edged weapon to be severed. 

Ropers are unaffected by lightning and take only half damage 
from cold-based attacks. They have a -4 penalty to saving 
throws vs. fire. 


Habitat Sodety: Ropers are not social and rarely cooperate with 
one another, though a group of them may be found in a good 
hunting spot. A group of ropers has been named a 'cluster'' by 
scholars with nothing better to do* 

Ropers reproduce asexually by shedding some of their material 
in the form of a seed. Drawing nutrients from the cavern floor 



(and perhaps siphoning magical energies from deep within the 
earth), the infant roper grows to maturity In 2d4 weeks. Until that 
tune has passed, the roper is indistinguishable from a boulder. 

Ropers move using large, cilia-like appendages on their under¬ 
sides, which also allow them to cling to walls and ceilings. They 
seldom leave the caverns, but may migrate to a new feeding 
ground when prey population drops too low in its current home* 
Migration usually occurs through underground tunnels, but 
when this is not possible, ropers travel late at night, sometimes 
giving rise to stories of walking stones. 

Ecology: Ropers eat any meat but prefer demihumans and hu¬ 
mans, Gnomes, dwarves, and other mining races often serve as 
prey for ropers, 

A roper has a gizzard-like organ which often holds undigested 
treasure. Platinum and gems cannot be digested by a roper, so its 
gizzard holds 3d6 platinum pieces, and has a 35% chance of 
holding 5d4 gems. The glue from a ropers strands is prized by 
alchemists, as are its digestive adds, which must be stored in 
platinum vials, 

Storoper 

A "stone-roper" is a roper with a more stony, less flexible exteri¬ 
or; it resembles a statue of a roper. Its rocky tentacles are always 
extended at least 20 feet, and can shoot to 50 feet to attack prey. 
The storoper can attack with all its tentacles at the same time, 
preferring to attack two victims with three tentacles each. Tvrice 
per day, the storoper can inject venom through its tentacles. Vic¬ 
tims must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or be para¬ 
lyzed for one round, then fight to aid the storoper; the venom 
lasts for 10 turns. Storopers' stony exteriors give them total pro¬ 
tection from normal missiles. Storopers have 6 HD. but have all 
the other abilities and statistics of a 10 HD roper.

Rust monsters are subterranean creatures with an appetite for all 
sorts of metals. These unique creatures, though generally inof¬ 
fensive, are the bane of fighters everywhere. 

The average rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high 
at the shoulder It has a strange tail that appears armor plated 
and ends in an odd-looking bony projection that resembles a 
double-ended paddle. Two prehensile antennae are located under 
the thing's two eyes. The hide of the rust monster is rough, cov* 
ered with lumpy projections. Coloration varies from a yellowish 
tan on the underside and legs, to a rust red upper back. Rust 
monsters smell like wet. oxidized metal. 

Combah Rust monsters are placid by nature, but when they get 
within scent range of metal they become excited and immedi¬ 
ately dash toward the source. Rust monsters can smdl metal up 
to 90 feet away. If the rust monsters antennae touch metal (deter¬ 
mined by a successful attack roll), the metal rusts. Magical items 
have a chance of being unaffected equal to 10% for each plus (a 
+ 2 weapon or armor has a 20% chance of not being affected). 
Any affected metal rusts or corrodes and immediately falls to 
pieces that are easily eaten and digested by the creature. Metal 
weapons striking a rust monster are affected just as if the crea¬ 
ture's antennae had touched them. Should a nonweapon metallic 
magical item happen to make contact with a rust monster, treat it 
as a +2 magical weapon for purposes of determining whether or 
not it breaks up. 

Rust monsters, being none too bright, stop pursuing a fleeing par¬ 
ty for one round to devour metallic items, such as a handful of iron 
spikes, a mace or a hammer if the party throws them behind. Rust 
monsters go after ferrous metals such as iron, steel and magical steel 
alloys, such as miihril and adamantite. They choose such metals 
over valuable metals such as copper, gold, silver, or platinum. In 
fact, they would continue to pursue a party that just dropped a fist¬ 
ful of copper corns, for example, in hopes of getting the much- 
preferred ferrous metal of armor and weapons. 

Sometimes (50% chance), a rust monster will even pause for 
one round during combat in order to eat. Rust monsters are not 



known for being tacticians, just ravenously hungry metal-eaters. 
Feeding time always takes one round regardless of the size of the 
metal meal 

Habitat/Society: Rust monsters dwell only in dark, subterra¬ 
nean places such as caverns and underground structures. They 
are not disposed to groups: often a lair comprises one or two rust 
monsters, with a 5% chance of encountering a single offspring, 
which acts as a half-strength rust monster with a full-strength ap¬ 
petite. These creatures have been known to range the length and 
breadth of an underground complex, searching for supplies of 
metal. Though it will eat raw ore, a rust monster always prefers 
the refined, forged metal (just as a human would prefer fresh, 
filtered water over swamp water). 

The creatures relatively inoffensive nature makes it an un¬ 
likely target. There have been many accounts of mages ap¬ 
proaching a rust monster and the only reaction from the beast 
was a cursory sniff, then a leisurely departure. Dwarves and 
gnomes, known for metalworking and mining, have no sympa¬ 
thy for rust monsters, and will do anything to get rid of them. 

The only treasure to be found in a rust monster lair h gems, 
usually the sort used for decoration on armor or sword pommels. 
Rust monsters have no grand designs, only the wish to keep well- 
fed. 

Ecology: Rust monsters help in removing metallic junk and 
clutter from underground fastnesses. In fact. It is not unusual to 
find a rust monster and a carrion crawler working in a symbiotic 
relationship, with the latter eating the organic litter and the farm¬ 
er consuming the metal castoffs.

Sahuagin are a vicious, predatory race of fish-men that live in 
warm coastal waters. They are highly organized and greatly en- 
joy raiding shore communities for food and sport. 

Typical sahuagms are blackish green on their backs, shading to 
green on their bellies, with black fins. Their great, staring eyes are 
deep, shining black. They have scaly skin, with webbed fingers and 
toes, and their mouths are filled with sharp fangs. About 1 in 216 
sahuagin is a mutation with four usable arms. These specimens are 
usually black shading to gray Females are indistinguishable from 
males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are a light 
green color, but they darken and attain full growth approximately 
one to two months after hatching. 

Sahuagin speak their own tongue. 

Combat: Though they wear no armor, their scales are tough 
and equal to AC 5. Sahuagin wear a harness to carry their per¬ 
sonal gear and weapons, A group of these creatures is typically 


armed as follows: 


Heavy crossbow &amp; dagger 

20% 

Spear Sc dagger 

30% 

Trident, net Sc dagger 

50% 


Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with 
dozens of hooks that make escape virtually impossible for unar¬ 
mored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a 
Strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by three javelins 
when the band forays onto land, The crossbows fire a maximum 
of 30 feet underw ater and normal ranges on the surface. Tridents 
have three uses—to spear small prey to pin prey trapped in nets, 
and to hold threatening opponents at bay. 

Sahuagin are well-equipped to attack even without weapons, 
for their webbed hands each end in long, sharp claws that can 
inflict 1-2 points of damage per attack. Their powerful rear legs 
are likewise taloned. and if they kick an opponent with them, 
they inflict ld4 points of damage with each hit from either foot. 
The sharp teeth of the sahuagin cause ]d4 points of damage if a 
bite is scored on a victim. Thus, it is possible for an unarmed 


sahuagin to attack three or five times in a melee round causing T 
2/1-2/1-4 and an extra 1-4/1-4 if the legs can rake. 

The eyes and ears of these monsters are particularly keen. 
They can see for 300 feet underwater at depths of up to 100 feet. 
For each 100 feet of greater depth, their vision is reduced by 10 
feet (e.g.. when 500 feet deep they can see 260 feet; when 1,000 
feet deep they can see 210 feet). Their ears are so sharp as to be 
able to detect the clinking of metal at one mile, or a boat oar 
splashing at twice that distance. 

A band of sahuagin is always led by a chieftain. He has one 
lieutenant for every ten members of the group. The chieftain has 
4+4 Hit Dice, and his lieutenants have 3 + 3 Hit Dice, All are in 
addition to the normal sahuagin in the group. 

When raiding villages, sahuagin attack en masse, with leaders 
in the second rank. As long as there is no truly spirited resistance, 
they continue in their plunder and violence. 

Underwater, in their natural element, the sahuagin are far 
more confident. Using the three-dimensional aspect of under¬ 
water fighting, they sometimes dive down on a group of under¬ 
water explorers, coming in from behind, and swooping down 
and past them, dropping nets on their intended victims. 

When sahuagin attack ships, they swarm up from all sides and try 
to overwhelm with numbers. They often grab their opponents and 
hurl them into the sea, where at least a fourth of the raiding party 
lurks, waiting for such an action or as reinforcements. Some leaders 
carry a conch shell, which when sounded gives the signal for the 
group of sahuagin in reserve to enter the fray 

Sahuagin have an almost paralyzing fear of spell casters. They 
direct their strongest attacks toward anyone who uses spells or 
spdl-like powers, such as the functions of some magical items, 
Their saving throws vs, fire-based spells suffer a -2 penalty, and 
they receive an additional point of damage per die of damage 
from such attacks. 

H a bi ta t. Sorie ty: The sahuagin are someti mes ref erred t o a s "sea 
devils" or "devil men of the deep." They dwell in warm salt waters 


306 






Sahuagin 


at depths of 100 to 1.500 feet, Sahuagm are predatory in the ex¬ 
treme, and they pose a threat to all laving things because they kill 
tor sport and pleasure as well as for food. They abhor fresh wa¬ 
ter They dislike light, and bright light such as that created by a 
continual light spell is harmful to their eyes. 

The social structure of the sahuagin is based upon rule by a 
king who holds court in a vast city deep beneath the waves. This 
overlord s domain is divided into nine provinces, each ruled by a 
prince. Each prince has 2dl0 + 10 nobles underneath him. Each 
noble controls the small groups of sahuagin dwelling in his fief. 
The sahuagin worship a great devil-shark. Sahuagin priests 
above 5th level are very rare. 

The king is supposed to dwell in a city somewhere at the great¬ 
est depth that a sahuagin can exist. This place is supposedly built 
in an undersea canyon with palaces and dwellings built along 
either bee. There, fully 5,000 of these monsters live, not count¬ 
ing the king's retinue of queens, concubines, nobles, guards, etc. , 
said to number 1,000 or more. The sahuagin king is reported to 
be of enormous size [10 Hit Dice+ 10 hit points), and of greatest 
evil. The king is always accompanied by nine noble guards (9 + 9 
Hit Dice) and the evil high priestess of all sahuagin (9+9 Hit 
Dice) with its retinue of nine underpriestesses (7th-level clerics). 

If sahuagin are encountered in their lair r there are the following 
additional sahuagin ■ 

1 baron (6 + 6 Hit Dice) 

Nine guards (3 + 5 Hit Dice) 

3d4 x 10 females (2 Hit Dice) 
ld4 x 10 hatchlings (1 Hit Die) 

2d4 x 10 eggs 

Also, there is a 10% chance per 10 male sahuagin that there is an 
evil priestess and ld4 assistant priestesses, for the religious life of 
these creatures is dominated by the females. If a priestess is with 
the group in the lair, it is of ld4 + l level ability, and the lesser 
clerics are 3rd or 4th level. 

There are always 2d4 sharks in a sahuagin lair. Sahuagin are 
able to make these monsters obey simple one- or two-word com¬ 
mands. Whenever a sahuagin lair is encountered, there is a 5% 
chance that it is the stronghold of a prince. The prince has 8+6 
Hit Dice phis nine guards of chieftain strength. There are also one 
Sth-levd sahuagin evil high priestess and four 4rh-levd unde¬ 
rpriestesses. The numbers of males, females, hatchlings and eggs 
in a prince s lair are double the numbers given above. There are 
4d6 sharks present at all times. 

Sahuagin lairs are actual villages or towns, constructed of 
stone. The buildings are domed, and the seaweed and similar ma¬ 
rine plants growing around and on these buildings make them 
hard to detect. 

Few persons have survived capture by the sahuagin, for pris¬ 
oners are usually quickly tortured and eaten. Any creatures tak¬ 
en alive from raids or intercepting unwelcome visitors are 
brought to the sahuagins' lair and confined in cells. Although sa- 
iteiSgvft snr aiAr to oxflf o/ avatar for to iW tWcafy, AJ&amp;stp k 

no air in the confinement areas in the typical village, but in the 
towns of the nobles there are special quarters to maintain air- 
breathing creatures. The sahuagin set aside a few prisoners to 
torture and provide sport—typically a fight to the death between 
two different creatures in an arena. The bulk of captives are sim¬ 
ply killed and eaten. It is seldom that any prisoner escapes, al¬ 
though the sahuagin find spori in allowing captives to think that 
they have found freedom, only to be encircled by sadistic guards 
while a school of sharks moves in for the kill* 


The sahuagin are cruel and brutal, and the strongest always 
bully the weaker, Any injured, disabled, or infirm specimen is 
slain and eaten by these cannibalistic monsters. Even imperfect 
hatchlings are dealt wi th in this fashion. This strict law has devel¬ 
oped a strong race, however, and any leader is subject to a chal¬ 
lenge. Sahuagin never stop growing, although they grow very 
slowly, and death comes to most before the years allow growth to 
large size. Leaders are always the largest and strongest. It is re¬ 
ported that the nine sahuagin princes are each ol the four-armed 
sort, as is the king. In any event, the loser of a challenge is always 
slain, either during combat or afterward. Sometimes the loser 
winds up as the main course at the victory feast. 

Duels are fought without weapons, only fang and claw being 
permitted. 

The sahuagin are chronicled because of their great evil, having 
time and again raided the land, desolating whole coasts, and de¬ 
stroying passing ships continually. The exact origin of the sa¬ 
huagin is unknown. It is suggested that they were created from a 
nation of particularly evil humans by the most powerful lawful 
evil gods in order to preserve them when the great deluge came 
upon the earth. Some sages claim that they are degenerate hu¬ 
mans who formerly dwelt on the seacoasts, whose evil and de¬ 
pravity was so great that they eventually devolved into fish-folk 
and sought the darkness of the ocean depths. The tritons how¬ 
ever, are purported to have believe that sahuagin are distantly 
related to sea elves, claiming that the drow spawned the sa¬ 
huagin. 

Sahuagin range as far as 50 miles from their lairs. Most of their 
lairs are located 2dl0 + 20 miles from coastal shores. Some of 
these creatures enjoy collecting pearls and coral formations, 
fashioning them into jewelry. This jewelry is worn as a status 
symbol. They are fond of wealth, which they use as a measure of 
influence, and for sacrifice to the deities that they worship in ex¬ 
change for granted powers and other favors. Most of the treasure 
found in a sahuagin lair belonged to former victims. There is usu¬ 
ally a high concentration of water-related items, such as magical 
boats, tridents, helms, potions, necklaces, etc. These were gained 
from adventurers who explored underwater too close to the sa¬ 
huagin community. 

These creatures w T ant nothing less than full control of the sea 
coasts, collecting as much wealth and power as possible in the 
process while maintaining the secrecy ol their lairs’ locations. 
Those who attempt escape are obsessively hunted down, for fear 
that the former prisoners may reveal Lhe location of the sa- 
huagins city 

Ecology; Sahuagin venture ashore on dark, moonless nights to 
raid and plunder human coastal towns. They hate even the evil 
ixitxaehitl, and only sharks are befriended by them. 

The feuds and outright warfare between the sahuagin and ixit- 
xachitl have indirectly contributed to preventing the ascendancy 
of the spellcasling, manta ray-like race. Sahuagin are also fond of 

the deep has kept the squid and kraken numbers down to a safe 
level. Conversely, these beasts enjoy eating sahuagin, which pre¬ 
vents the sahuagin from overrunning coastal areas. 

Of all the sea-dwelling races, tritons, sea dves, dolphins, and 
hippocampi are the most implacable enemies of the sahuagin. in 
fact, the few air-breathers that have escaped the sahuagin owe 
their freedom to such beings that bravely aided the captives.

Abo called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half- 
goat creatures. They symbolize natures carefree ways. Satyrs have the 
torso, head and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat. The human 
head is surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyrs 
coarse, curly hair. The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light 
brown, with rare individuals (1%) with red skin. A satyr's hair b medi¬ 
um, reddish, or dark brown. The horns and hooves are black. 

Satyrs have their own tongue and can speak elven and Common Sa¬ 
tyrs living near centaurs are 80% likely to be friendly with them and 
speak their language. Rarely (5%), satyrs are found with korred. 

Combat! Satyrs have keen senses, so they gain a +2 bonus on surprise 
rolls They can be almost silent , and can blend with foliage so as to be 
9Q% undetectable; this gives opponents a -1 penalty to surprise rolls. 
Satyrs have infravision to a distance of 60 feet, 

A satyr attacks by butting with its sharp horns. Some (20% ) use +1 
magical weapons especially long or short swords, daggers, or short 
bows. Before resorting to combat, a satyr often plays a tune on its pipes, 
an instrument only a satyr can use properly. Using these pipes, the satyr 
can cast charm, sleep or cause fear, affecting all within 60 feel, unless 
they make a successful saving throw vs. spell. 

Usually only one satyr per band has pipes. If comely females (Charisma 
15 +) are in a group met by satyrs, the piping will be to rrhumt Should the 
intruders be relatively inoffensive, the piping casts sleep, and the satyrs steal 
all of the victims choice food and drink, as well as weapons, valuables, and 
magical items. If intruders are hostile, the piping is used to cause fear The 
effects of the piping lasts Ido hours or until dispelled. Any creature that saves 
vs. piping is not affected by additional music from the same pipes in that 
encounter. A bards singing can nullify the pipes music before it takes effect. 

Habitat-Society: Satyrs are interested only in sport: frolicking, piping, chas¬ 
ing wood nymphs, and other pleasures. They resent intrusions and drive 
away any creature that offends therm A lucky wanderer may stumble on a 
woodland celebration, which will contain an equal number of dryads and 
fauns plus 3dS other woodland creatures and a 25% chance of 2d6 centaurs 
Strangers are welcomed only if they contribute some good food and drink, 
especially superior (10 + gp per bottle) wines. Such wine can also be used to 
lore or bribe satyrs. It a group includes elves, they have a better chance of 
being welcomed. 

These celebrations last all night in warm months, with newcomers waking 
up the next morning with massive headaches, minus a few valuables, and not 
a woodland creature (nor their tracksj to be found. 

Shying away from the trapping* of an organized society a colony of satyrs 
usually includes young numbering 50% of the adults Satyrs live in comfort¬ 
able caves and hollow trees There are no female satyrs and sages believe that 



dryads are the female counterparts of the satyr, and that satyrs mat*; with 
dryads to produce more satyrs and dryads. Satyrs share the dryads affection 
for humans of the opposite sex, but a female charmed by a satyr might return 
after Id4 weeks (10% chance). 

Satyrs are an inoffensive, fun-loving rate. They rarely venture more 
than 10 miles from their homes, most often doing so to gather food, They 
are fond of venison and small game but also eai plants and fruits, 

Ecology; Satyrs in sylvan woodlands* keep game animal populations at 
normal levels; they never hunt to excess or despoil plants 

Korred 

This small, dance-loving relative of the satyr looks much like its cousins, 
but lacks horns, and has wildly flowing beard and hair, Korred smell like 
pine trees and fresh earth. They usually wear leather britches, Carry large 
leather pouches, and wield oaken cudgels, They have loud voices and 
speak their own language, plus those ol satyrs, dryads, centaurs, and 
elves: a few even speak druidic. 

Korred have 18/76 Strength. They hurl boulders up to 100 feel (dam¬ 
age Id&amp;h ot use cudgels (ld&amp; damage), shears tld4 damage), or fists (ld2 
damage), gaming a +4 to damage because of their Strength. 

Korred can weave their hair into entangling ropes and snares in ld4 
rounds. Such ropes have AC 1, 5 hp, and a movement rate of 3. Anyone 
attacked by the ropes must make a saving throw vs. spells or be entan- 
gled. The ropes sometimes guard special areas. 

A korred may use its magical Imigh three times per day: unless it Is nullified 
by a bards singing, all within 60 feet must roll above their Charisma scare or 
be stunned for ld4 rounds, Korred can also use the following abilities at will, 
one per round; stone shape, animate rock, stone door (teleport 30'), shatter 
rock, transmute rock to mud. and stone tell 

Korred do not have structured communities: families in a common clan 
live within 5 miles of one another. Korred do not tolerate outsiders, ex¬ 
cept for rare rangers, druids, and elves. Even these must not interrupt the 
weekly korred dance. Those who interrupt must make a saving throw vs. 
spells or dance themselves, losing ld4 hp per round until dead or re¬ 
strained. or until the korred stop playing and dancing. 

Korred pouches contain hair, shears, and other items. These items turn 
to gold (5d4 * 10 gp valucl if sprinkled with holy water. A korred will not 
voluntarily give up this pouch

Giant scorpions are vicious predators that live almost anywhere, in¬ 
cluding relatively cold places such as dungeons, though they Favor 
deserts and warm lands. These creatures are giant versions of the 
normal 4-inch-long scorpion found in desert climes. 

The giant scorpion has a green carapace and yellowish green legs 
and pincers. The segmented tail is black, with a vicious stinger on the 
end. There is a bitter smell associated w ith the scorpion, which prob¬ 
ably comes from the venom. They make an unnerving scrabbling 
sound as they travel across dungeon Floors. 

Combat: The giant scorpion is 95% likely to attack any creature that 
approaches. The creature has a hard, chitinous carapace that gives it 
Armor Class 3. This monster attacks by grabbing prey with its two 
huge pincers, inflicting TIO points of damage each, while it lashes for¬ 
ward with its tail to sting Thus, it can fight three opponents at once. If 
a giant scorpion manages to grab a victim in a pincer, it will automati¬ 
cally inflict l-10 points of damage each round until it releases the vic¬ 
tim. The victim has but one chance to escape. If he can make his fiend 
bars/lift gates roll, he will escape the claw. However, this can be the 
characters only action that round and it can be tried only once per 
combat. If the sting is employed against an untrapped victim, an attack 
roll is required for a successful attack, but a trapped character is auto¬ 
matically struck by any stmg attack directed at him with no attack roll 
required. 

The sting inflicts 1-4 points of damage and the victim must save 
versus poison or die the next round (type F), Note that scorpions are 
not immune to their own poison. If a scorpion is reduced to 1 or 2 hit 
points, it will go into a stinging frenzy, stinging everything in sight, 
gaining two attempts to hit per round with only the tail. Slain crea¬ 
tures are dragged to the scorpion's burrow lo be eaten, 

Habitat/Societyr Giant scorpions live in underground burrows or 
dungeons. Each lair may (20%) have 5d4 scorpion eggs. These beasts 
eat any living creature that is unfortunate enough to stray too close 
to their lair. Any treasure found comes from the bodies of human or 
demihuman victims that have been dragged here to be consumed. 
Armor is rarely found intact, since the scorpion will surely have used 
its pincers to cut up its prey. 

Ecology: These bizarre insects contribute to the ecosystem by feed¬ 
ing on other giant versions of insects such as spiders and ants. They 
themselves are prey for purple worms and other huge, subterranean 
creatures. Alchemists and assassins prize the scorpion s venom be¬ 
cause of its potency. 


Large and Huge Scorpions 

Often found in dungeons and wildernesses, these creatures are merely 
smaller versions of the giant scorpion. Colors range from tan to brown to 
black, and rumors persist of rare white scorpions deep underground. All 
attack with pincers and tail stinger. If struck by the stinger, the victim 
must save versus poison or die the next round. However, the poison of 
the large scorpion is weaker than normal (type A, 15 0 points damage? 
giving the victim a +2 on his saving throw. Huge scorpions have deadly 
(type F) poison and can pin a victim in a way similar to the giant scorpi¬ 
on, but with the huge scorpion the victim can still fight back. It is not 
unusual to see scorpions of various sizes fighting with each other.

A sea lion is a fearsome creature with the head and torepaws of a 
lion and the body and tail of a fish. 

Combat: Sea lions are ferocious and difficult to deal withi, They 
are very territorial and usually attack anything that enters their 
domains, no matter what the size. Their vicious teeth and huge 
paws are a match even for most sharks, which they hate above all 
other creatures. Sea lions must attack the same opponent with 
paws and teeth and cannot divide attacks. Any creature hit by 
both paw attacks in the same round is being mauled. Mauled 
creatures cannot attack if they have not already done so that 
round and must roll a successful open doors roll to free them¬ 
selves. When mauling a creature, the lion follows up with a bite 
attack with a + 4 bonus to the attack roll, causing double damage 
if successful. 

The head of a sea lion, with its thick mane, is treated as AC 5, 
while the rest of its scaly body is AC 3. 

Sea lions are very difficult to raise in captivity, but can become 
the best and most loyal of steeds. In fact, they are arguably Lhe 
most powerful mountable creature beneath the waves. They are 
very useful as guarding and hunting beasts, since their tremen¬ 
dous roar can be heard for up to 10 miles underwater, providing 
ample time to prepare for an attack or to send help. They are not 
as skillful swimmers as are sea horses—they are the underwater 
equivalents of Maneuverability Class B creatures. 

Habitat Society: Sea horses and sea lions almost never en¬ 
counter one another as sea lions prefer to dwell in the shallow 
coastal regions, while sea horses delve the deeps. This is primari¬ 
ly due to their respective dietary differences. Sea horses eat 
plankton, while sea lions eat any type of meat, be it a fish, dino¬ 
saur, or wandering herd animals caught drinking at the waters 
edge. Sea lions are not afraid of land and it is not unheard of for 
sea lions to drag themselves a few dozen yards up the beach in 
search of meals. While these attacks are rare indeed, the reports 
of sea lions in the vicinity does tend to foster more fear among 
the general populace than a simple shark aLtack does. But in a 
world of krakens, dinosaurs, and vampires, sea lions are a rela¬ 
tively minor threat. 

Sea lions roam the seas in packs, what might be called a pride 
of lions on land. The strongest one (usually with maximum hit 



points) is the leader. In a sea lion pack, both sexes hunt and care 
for young, but the males are superior hunters, something that 
differentiates them from their land-based cousins. 

While sea lions rarely travel anywhere with specific goals in 
mind, they do sometimes team up to aid other packs of lions, 
usually when they roam close enough to hear the collective bel¬ 
lowing of their comrades. But territoriality comes into play im¬ 
mediately after the kill is made, and rarely does the reigning 
leader allow the helpful newcomers to share in the spoils of the 
victory. Often a new battle for power ensues between the two 
leaders. If the resident leader wins, the newcomers leave without 
a taste of meat. If the newcomer wins, he and his pack remain 
just long enough to take first choice of flesh, and then depart for 
home. The remaining leader, vanquished and weakened before 
his peers, rarely lives long enough to enjoy the spoils. 

Ecology: Sea lions hate sharks, often going to great lengths to 
hunt them down. The taste of sharks is apparently abhorrent to 
sea lions and they always leave the carcass uneaten, so it is some¬ 
thing of a mystery why this rivalry exists. Some sages claim that 
it is the result of conflicts between the lesser deities of nature, but 
it is more likely two strong predators vying for supremacy of the 
seas. 

Became of the water-proofing qualities of their thick scales, 
sea lions can remain out of water for up to 24 hours before their 
gills dry out and become incapable of removing oxygen from the 
water. If a sea lion is fed a constant source of water into its 
mouth, it can survive for an entire week before disease enters the 
cracking scales and starvation takes its tolL It is theoretically 
possible to keep a sea lion in captivity but, like most aquatic car¬ 
nivores, the restriction of space is often psychologically too 
much for the creature and death slowly takes the once-proud 
beast.

Selkies are seal-like beings that have the ability to change into 
human form for a few days at a time. 

When in their true, seal-like forms, they are nearly indistin¬ 
guishable from normal seals. Close inspection of their arms, 
however will reveal the presence of slightly webbed hands in¬ 
stead of fore flippers and legs instead of a tapering body and rear 
flippers. Once a month, each selkie is able to assume human form 
for about a week* Usually selkies prefer to briefly visit the realm 
of men (which they call the ’overworkT) out of curiosity, but 
sometimes they are ordered to go forth and purchase desperately 
needed supplies or information. When in human form, selkies are 
very attractive indeed and their fine looks have broken more 
than a few overwurlderV hearts. Their eyes are particularly no¬ 
ticeable as they are always either a bright emerald green or star¬ 
tling light blue. Since the selkie transformation is not a spell or 
magical effect, only spells like true seeing will reveal a selkies 
true nature, although their peculiar mannerisms and predilection 
for seafood also might. 

Combat: Since selkies are unable to swim quickly while carry¬ 
ing weapons, 90% of selkies encountered underwater will be un¬ 
armed, They use their sharp teeth whenever they are cornered 
but prefer to use their impressive speed underwater to escape su¬ 
perior odds. If encountered on land, selkies are wise enough to 
bear human weapons, most likely swords scavenged from the 
wrecks of ships (see below). 

Habitat'Society: Selkie communities are divided between male 
and female, with females usually outnumbering males, as male 
selkies are the hunter gatherers throughout the often dangerous 
waters nearby. However, both aspects of selkie ‘‘community* 
(domestic and provider) are equally respected within the lair, and 
no sex is accorded undue privileges. 

Selkies inhabit only colder waters and there are both saltwater 
and freshwater varieties. Selkies almost always build their lairs in 
huge, underwater caverns and grottos containing both air and 
water-filled regions— selkie young must be raised in an air-filled 
environment for about their first year. 

As mentioned earlier, selkies often find and explore wrecks of 
sunken treasure. Most selkie communities have hoarded at least 



some booty (especially pearls), keeping those otherwise useless 
trinkets only for purposes of trade with the overworld. Only 
selkies who have visited the overworld many times have ever 
acquired a taste for ornamenting themselves like overworlders, 
and can be distinguished from more traditional selkies immedi¬ 
ately, For obvious reasons, these more experienced selkies are 
often the best representatives to deal with if one is an over- 
worlder. Selkies can be hired and have a limited knowledge of 
overworlder customs. All magical treasure recovered by selkies 
is immediately commandeered for the good of the community 
and the lair’s defense. 

Ecology: Selkies are omnivorous, preferring to eat fish, shell¬ 
fish, crustaceans, and various forms of seaweed. Those that have 
visited the surface are often partial to human fare as well. Selkies 
are particularly susceptible to fine wine, which is to be expected 
since these intoxicants are unknown below the seas, 

Selkies are sensitive about their environment and harvest only 
what they need to survive. It is worth noting that selkie repre¬ 
sentatives lobby heavily whenever local overworlder environ¬ 
mental issues threaten selkie existence. Most selkie communities 
have learned the value of dropping a few pearls here and there in 
order to get what they want from men. 

While selkies in human form are quite beautiful, they are for¬ 
tunate indeed that their pelts have little value in overworlder 
markets. They are, therefore, without any special enemies be¬ 
sides those common to seals and all ocean dwelling beings. 

Selkie, Leader 

Each venerable leader of a selkie community can cast the follow¬ 
ing spells once per day, one spell per round: augur y, cure light 
wounds, and cure disease. Leaders can also cast weather sum¬ 
moning and control weather once per week. Selkies fear the 
wrath of the sea should they ever use their powers for ill.

Shadows are shadowy undead creatures that drain strength from 
their victims with their chilling touch. 

Shadows are 90% undetectable in all but the brightest of sur¬ 
roundings (continual light or equivalent), as they normally ap¬ 
pear to be nothing more than their name would suggest. In bright 
light they can be dearly seen. 

Combat: As shadows exist primarily on the Negative Material 
plane, they have the ability to drain the life force of their victims. 
The chilling touch of a shadow inflicts 2-5 points of damage to its 
victim as well as draining one point of Strength. Lost Strength 
points return 2-8 turns after being touched, If a human or demi- 
human opponent is reduced to zero Strength or zero hit points by 
a shadow the shadow has drained the life force and the oppo¬ 
nent becomes a shadow as well. The newly formed shadow is 
then compelled to join the roving band and pursue a life of evil. 
Other living creatures simply collapse from fatigue (if taken to 
zero Strength) or fall unconscious (if taken to zero hit points), 
where they are left to die or are hounded again upon waking. 

Shadows are immune to sleep, charm , and hold spells and are 
unaffected by cold-based attacks. They can be turned by clerics. 

Habilat'Society; Shadows travel in loosely organized packs 
that freely roam ancient ruins, graveyards, and dungeons. They 
specialize in terrifying their victims. 

Shadows have no leaders and thus spend much of their time 
roaming aimlessly about their chosen surroundings. Contrary to 
popular belief, shadows do not hoard treasure. In fact, such 
earthly baubles only help to remind the creatures of their former 
lives. Instead, the furious undead throw all of the treasure they 
rind away, in the same location (often at the bottom of a well or 
deep pit j, where it is out of sight of the band. It is therefore specu¬ 
lated that the removal of a shadow hoard would be quite easy 
(even welcomed), were it not for the fact that shadows attack 
living beings without hesitation, regardless of their intent or 
threat. 



Ecology; According to most knowledgeable sages, shadow’s ap¬ 
pear to have been magically created, perhaps as part of some an¬ 
cient curse laid upon some long-dead enemy. The curse affects 
only humans and demihumans, so it would seem that it affects 
the soul or spirit. When victims no longer cart resist, either 
through loss of consciousness (hit points) or physical prowess 
(Strength points), the curse is activated and the majority of Lhe 
character's essence is shifted to the Negative Material plane. Only 
a shadow of their former self remains on the Prime Material 
plane, and the transformation always renders the victim both ter¬ 
ribly insane and undeniably evil. 

Attempts to remove the curse from captured shadows have all 
failed, thus providing more clues into the nature of the disorder. 
A limited wish spell proved only partially successful as the victim 
returned for an hour but remained insane for the duration. It has 
been recently speculated that a full wish, followed by a heal spell, 
might be capable of restoring a shadow to his former state, but 
again it must be emphasized that this is only a theory. 

Fortunately shadows rarely leave their lairs, and a bold party 
wishing to rescue a lost fighter or wizard should have plenty of 
time to venture forth and recover their friend, provided that no 
one else explores the lair and slays the unfortunate character 
while the shadows are absent. 

The original body of a victim is destroyed when changed to a 
shadow whether by the curse itself or by unprotected exposure to 
Lhe Negative Material plane. In any case, killing a shadow is 
merely a case of severing the bond between the Prime Material 
and Negative Material forms.

Shedu are native to hot, arid climates, They have powerful, 
stocky equine bodies with short, powerful feathered wings. Their 
heads are large and humanoid, and rather dwarven in appear¬ 
ance. They always have beard sand mustache.s Shedu hair is 
very bristly and curls into tight waves or bands. 

All shedu wear a simple headband made of braided cloth or 
rope, with a single button for adornment. The button is centered 
on the forehead, and its material represents the bearers status. 
From the lowest rank to the highest, a button may be made of 
silver, gold, platinum, sapphire, ruby, or diamond. Lesser shedu 
almost never have a button above the platinum level, greater she¬

Shedu wander the Prime material, astral and ethereal planes. 
They further the cause of law and goodness, help allied creatures 
in need, and combat evil Greater shedu typically lead herds of 
six or more lesser shedu. 

Combat: All shedu attack with powerful front hooves. However, 
both forms of shedu prefer to use their psionic powers whenever 
possible.

Sirines are beautiful, human-like females, at home in any aquatic 
environment. They have human skin tones ranging to a light 
yellow-green, and their hair can be almost any color, though sil¬ 
ver and dark green are the most common* Sirines have beautiful 
figures and wear scanty clothing at best. 

Most sirines are antisocial, so they try to drive intruders away, 
with evil sirines taking stronger measures. Other sirines are hun¬ 
gry for social interaction, and try to lure male humans or demi- 
humans to join them for a time, 

Sirines speak their own language and the language of the near¬ 
est intelligent races. They can breathe water and air and they 
have infra vision to a range of 120 feet* 

Combat: A lone sirine will always have 6 or 7 HD; each member 
of a group has an equal chance for 4&gt; 5. or 6 HD. All members of 
a group have the same basic alignment I all evil, all good, or all 
neutral in regards to good and evil). All sirines can defend their 
solitude with some skill. 

Sirines have a Dexterity of 18: combined with their innate 
magic, this grants them an exceptional Armor Class. Most (90%) 
sirines cany a short sword or a dagger, and 30% carry missile 
weapons, javelins or slings, as well Each weapon has a 10% 
chance of being magical, and jmwUns of lightning are common, 
Sirines also have several Spell-like abilities, each usable once 
per day as an 11 th-level wizard: charm person, fog cloud , poly¬ 
morph self, and improved invisibility. The charm ability is used 
through the sirine's song, and all people within 30 feet are subject 
to it, even if they are hostile or attacking. 

Lf the sirine touches an opponent, the victim must make a sav¬ 
ing throw vs. poison; those failing to save are reduced to an Intel¬ 
ligence of 2, The touch Is automatic for charmed individuals, but 
requires a normal attack roll for others, A successful dispel magic 
(against llth-level casting) wilt restore the victim's intelligence, 
as will a sirines touch, if she so wills it. Any sirine can restore 
intelligence taken by another sirine. 

Sirines make saving throws as llth-level wizards, with a +2 
bonus vs. poison. They are immune to all gas attacks. 



Habitat/Society: Sirines are encountered only in lonely places 
that are otherwise uninhabited. Most live near rocky outcrop¬ 
pings or small islands in the sea. Some choose to live in fresh 
water, but tend to avoid these areas because they are usually pop¬ 
ulated and sometimes difficult to reach. 

Young sirines often live with their sisters: these sirines are the 
more social type. As a sirine grows older, she becomes more re¬ 
clusive and contemplative, however, and eventually looks for a 
home of her own where she can think and sing in solitude. Even 
then, they have a rare desire for companionship, 

Sirines usually mate with male humans. Some sirines choose 
elves, tritons, or merfolk as mates, producing children with some 
of their parents" traits (pointed ears from elves, green skin from 
aquatic elves, scales and webbed fingers and toes from merfolk 
and tritons), Sirines never form lasting relationships, for the call 
of the sea is too great to bind them. 

After a gestation period of nine months, they give birth to ld4 
baby sirines, which are cared for by their mother until they are 
five years old. After that, they fend For themselves, living on the 
bounty of the sea. Reaching adulthood at 10 years, they live for 
about 50 years, and yet their beauty never leaves them. 

Sirines live to sing, and to think about the sea. If deprived of 
their voices, or confined away from water, they will slowly with¬ 
er away until they die. Sirines often have great knowledge re¬ 
garding the history of their area and any current events. They 
sometimes trade this knowledge for companionship. 

Ecology: Sirines are not harmful to their environment in any 
manner. They kill only enough to eat, and never take too much 
from the sea. They have few natural enemies, and they are more 
than able of taking care of themselves. Though they make beauti¬ 
ful garments from sea shells, fish skin, and seaweed, they gain 
other belongings and treasure by scavenging shipwrecks.

All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created 
as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests. 

Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which 
would allow" movement Instead, the bones are magically joined 
together during the casting of an animate dead spell. Skeletons 
have no eyes or internal organs. 

Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demi- 
humans, animate of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids 
like bugbears and giants. 

Combat: MarvsLzed humanoid skeletons always light with 
weapons, usually a rusty sword or spear. Because of their magical 
nature, they do not fight as well as living beings and inflict only 1-6 
points of damage when they hit. Animat skeletons almost always 
bite for 1-4 points of damage, unless they would obviously inflict 
less (Le,, skeletal rats should inflict only 1-2 points, etc.). Monster 
skeletons, always constructed from humanoid creatures, use giant- 
sized weapons which inflict the same damage as their living 
counterparts but without any Strength bonuses. 

Skeletons are immune to all s/eep, charm , and hold spells. Be¬ 
cause they are assembled from bones, cold-based attacks also do 
skeletons no harm. The fact that they are mostly empty means 
that edged or piercing weapons (like swords, daggers, and 
spears) inflict only half damage when employed against skele¬ 
tons. Blunt weapons, with larger heads designed to break and 
crush bones, cause normal damage against skeletons. Fire also 
does normal damage against skeletons. Holy water inflicts 2-8 
points of damage per vial striking the skeleton. 

Skeletons are immune to fear spells and need never check mo¬ 
rale, usually being magically commanded to fight to the death. 
When a skeleton dies, ti falls to pieces with bud dunks and rattles. 

Habitat Society; Skeletons have no social life or interesting 
habits. They can be found anywhere there is a wizard or priest 
powerful enough to make them. Note that some neutral priests of 
deities of the dead or dying often raise whole armies of animated 
followers in times of trouble. Good clerics can make skeletons 
only if the dead being has granted permission (either before or 
after death 1 and if the clerics deity has given express permission 
to do so. Otherwise, violating the eternal rest of any being or 
animal is something most good deities disapprove of highly. 

Skeletons have almost no minds whatsoever, and can obey on¬ 


ly the simplest one- or two-phrase orders from their creators. 
Skeletons f ight in unorganized masses and tend to botch complex 
orders disastrously. It is not unheard of to find more than one 
type of skeleton (monsters with animals, animals with humans) 
working together to protect their master's dungeon or tower. 

Ecology: Unless the skeletons remains are destroyed or scat¬ 
tered far apart, the skeleton can be created anew with the appli¬ 
cation of another animate dead spell. Rumors of high-level 
animate dead spells which create skeletons capable of reforming 
themselves to continue fighting after being destroyed have not 
been reliably comfirmed.

Giant skeletons are similar to the more common undead skele¬ 
ton, but they have been created with a combination of spells and 
are, thus, far more deadly than their lesser counterparts. 

Giant skeletons stand roughly 12 feet tall and look to be made 
from the bones of giants. In actuality, they arc simply human 
skeletons that have been magically enlarged. They are normally 
armed with long spears or scythes that end in keen bone blades. 
Rare individuals will be Found carrying shields (and thus have an 
Armor Class of 3), but these are far from common. A small mag¬ 
ical fire bums in the chest of each giant skeleton, a by-product of 
the magics that are used to make them. These flames begin just 
above the pelvis and reach upward to lick at the collar bones. 
Mysteriously, no burning or scorching occurs where the flames 
touch the bone. 

Giant skeletons do not communicate in any way. They can 
obey simple, verbal commands given to them by their creator, 
but will ignore all others, in order for a command to be under¬ 
stood by these animated skeletons, it must contain no more than 
three distinct concepts. For example, "stay in this room, make 
sure that nobody comes in, and don’t allow the prince to leave,', 
would be the type of command these creatures could obey. 

Combat: In melee combat, giant skeletons most frequently attack 
with bone-bladed scythes or spears. Each blow that lands inflicts 
Id 12 points of damage. 

Once per hour (6 turns), a skeleton may reach into its chest and 
draw forth a sphere of fire from the flames that bum within its rib 
cage. This flaming sphere can be hurled as if it were a fireball that 
delivers Sd6 points of damage. Because these creatures are im¬ 
mune to harm from both magical and normal fires, they wrill free¬ 
ly use this attack in dose quarters. 

Giant skeletons are immune to steep, charm, hold. or similar 
mind-affecting spells. Cold-based spells inflict half damage to 
them, lightning inflicts full damage, while fire (as has already 
been mentioned) cannot harm them. They suffer half damage 
from edged or piercing weapons and but 1 point of damage per 
die from all manner of arrows, quarrels, or missiles. Blunt melee 
weapons inflict full damage on them* 



Being undead, giant skeletons can be turned by priests and pal* 
adins. They are more difficult to turn than mundane skeletons, 
however, being treated as if they were mummies. Holy water that 
is splashed upon them inflicts 2d4 points of damage per vial. 

Habitat Society; The first giant skeletons to appear in Ravenloft 
were created by the undead priestess Radaga in her lair within the 
domain of Kartakass. Others have since mastered the spells and 
techniques required to create these monsters; thus, giant skele¬ 
tons are gradually beginning to appear in other realms where the 
dead and undead lurk. 

Giant skeletons are employed as guards and sentinels by those 
with the power to create them. It is said that the Dark Powers can 
see everything that transpires before the eyes of these foul autonv 
atom, but there is no proof supporting this rumor. 

Ecology: Like lesser animated skeletons, these undead things 
have no true claim to any place in nature. They are created from 
the bones of those who have died and are abominations in the 
eyes of all who belief in the sanctity of life and goodness. 

The process by which giant skeletons are created is dark and 
evil. Attempts to manufacture them outside of Ravenloft have 
failed, so it is dear that they are in some way linked to the Dark 
Powers themselves. In order to create a giant skeleton, a spell 
caster must have the intact skeleton of a normal human or demi- 
human. On a night when the land is draped in fog, they must cast 
an animate dead, produce fire, enlarge, and a resist fire spell over 
the bones. When the last spell is cast, the bones lengthen and 
thicken and the creatures rises up. The the creator must make a 
Ravenloft Powers check for his part in this evil undertaking.

Formerly powerful fighters, skeleton warriors are undead lords 
forced into their nightmarish states by powerful wizards or evil 
demigods who trapped their souls in golden circlets. The sole rea¬ 
son that skeleton warriors remain on the Prime Material plane is 
to search for and recover the circlets that contain their souls. 

A skeletal warrior appears as a cracked and yellowing skeleton 
covered with shards of decaying flesh. Its eyes are black holes 
containing pinpoints of reddish light. It is dad in the blackened 
armor and rotted trappings it wore in its former life. 

Combat: Anyone possessing a skeleton warriors circlet can 
control its actions, so long as the controller remains within 240 
feet of the warrior. The controller is either in active control of the 
warrior or in a passive mode. When in active control the con¬ 
troller can see whatever the skeleton sees, and he can mentally 
command it to fight, search for treasure, or take any other 
actions; however, the controller himself is unable to cast spells, 
move, or take any other actions while in active control. When in 
the passive mode, the controller can take any normal actions, but 
he is unable to see through the warrior's eyes; the skeleton war¬ 
rior remains inert while the controller is in passive mode. The 
controller can change between the passive mode and active con¬ 
trol at will 

The controller must have the warrior's circlet on his head in 
order to control the warrior. If the circlet is removed from the 
controller's head, he can no longer control the warrior; likewise, 
if the controller and the warrior are separated by more than 240 
feet, the controller can no longer control the warrior. If the circlet 
remains in the controllers possession, he can resume control at a 
later time. But if the controller loses the circlet, either by accident 
or by a deliberate act, the warrior immediately proceeds toward 
the controller at twice its normal movement rate (12) to attack 
and destroy him. The warrior does not rest until it destroys its 
former controller or until control is re-established. If the warrior 
holds the circlet to its head, both the warrior and the circlet turn 
to dust, never to reappear. 

When a character first comes into possession of a circlet, he is 
unlikely to be aware that the skeleton warrior is tracking him, 
unless he recognizes the circlet r s significance. To establish control 
for the first time, the character not only must hold the circlet to 
his head, he must be able to see the warrior and concentrate on 



the establishment of control for one round and then roll a suc¬ 
cessful Wisdom check; if he fails the Wisdom check, he can try 
again in subsequent rounds. Meanwhile, the skeleton warrior 
continues to approach, attempting to destroy the character and 
gain possession of the circlet. If his concentration is broken be¬ 
fore control is established—for instance, if he has to defend him¬ 
self against an attack—he must concentrate again for three 
rounds. Once control has been established for the first time, it 
can only be broken as indicated above. To be effective, the circlet 
cannot be worn with any other headgear; placing it in a helm, for 
instance, nullifies its powers, though the skeleton warrior is still 
aware of the circlets presence. 

Skeleton warriors usually fight with two-handed swords, but 
they can use other weapons as well. Skeleton warriors make all 
weapon attacks with a +3 bonus to their attack roll; this is an 
innate ability, the weapon itself is not magical. 

Only magical weapons affect skeleton warriors. They have a 
90% magical resistance. The mere sight of a skeleton warrior 
causes any creature with fewer than 5 Hit Dice to flee in panic. 
Skeleton warriors cannot be turned by priests. 


Habitat Society: Skeleton warriors are usually found near the 
areas where they died in their former lives, or where they were 
buried. A skeleton warrior usually has a sizeable collection of 
treasure, the remnants of a lifetime of adventure. Since a skeleton 
warrior is preoccupied with recovering its tifdet, protecting its 
treasure is not a priority. 


Ecology: Skeleton warriors are used by their controllers as 
bodyguards, servants, or workers. Since skeleton warriors are 
obsessed with their circlets and are theref ore undependable, evil 
creatures and other undead seldom associate with them, Skeleton 
warriors do not eat, sleep, or perform any other physiological 
functions.

The slaadi are great frog-like beings, who dwell on the outer 
plane of Limbo, Their form is that of a large bipedal frog, though 
some of the more powerful slaadi have polymorph self or shape 
change abilities and sometimes appear as men. In frog form their 
heads are huge and their daws are extremely sharp. There are 
powerful symbols embedded into their foreheads signifying 
rank. They speak their own language and, occasionally, some ad¬ 
ditional evil languages. Telepathy allows them to understand and 
converse with all things. 

Red Slaad 

Slaadi are vicious combatants and quick to attack all other crea- 
lures. They can be ruthless when encountered in numbers, often 
surrounding smaller groups of beings and bullying and torment¬ 
ing them before finally slaying the lot. 

Combat: Red slaadi attack with two daws for 1-4 points of dam¬ 
age per hit and bile for 2-16 points. They are not terribly intelli¬ 
gent, so they choose predictable, uninspired tactics. 

Red slaadi have a special gland under the skin of each daw. 
When one hits with a claw attack, there is a 25 % chance that an 
egg pellet is planted in its opponent's body The egg pellet begins 
to move through the victim's body often without the victim even 
knowing he has been infected until it reaches the chest cavity 
There it gestates for three months, forming a baby red slaad that 
will eats it way out of the victims body killing him. The victim 
falls very ill 24 hours before the baby slaad eats its way out. An 
egg pellet can only be detected by a detect evil spelL and de¬ 
stroyed by a remove curse or similar spell. 

Red slaadi regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per melee round. 
They can attempt to gate in 1-2 additional red slaadi twice per 
day with a 35 % chance of success. Once per day red slaadi may 
stun by emitting a loud croak that affects all opponents within 20 
feet of the slaad. Victims must make a saving throw vs. petrifica¬ 
tion or be disabled for two rounds. 

Blue Slaad 

Blue slaad are ruthless warriors that specialize in mass combat. 



Combat: Blue slaadi have two razor-sharp bone rakes sticking 
out from the back of each hand. These potent weapons inflict 2- 
12 points of damage on a successful hit, They have perfected 
their fighting style with these rakes* which give them two attacks 
per hand. Their bite does 2-16 points of damage per hit and has a 
10% chance of infecting the steads opponent with a rotting dis¬ 
ease, Blue slaadi have the following magical abilities: 
hold person, one person only, passwail and tele kinesis. 

They may attempt to gflfe in either 1-4 red slaadi or 1-2 blue 
slaadi. four times per day with a 40% chance of success. 

Green Slaad 

Very rarely seen, they are the highest form of lesser slaadi. They 
attack vvlth daws for 3 to 3 (ld6+2) points of damage. 

Gray Slaad 

Known as executioners, and very rare, gray slaadi are great 
slaadi. They use a claw/claw/bite routine for 4 to 10 points of 
damage from their wicked daws, and 2 to 16 points of damage 
from the vicious bite they inflict upon opponents. 

Death Slaad 

The greatest of all the slaadi, and the absolute masters of their 
race. Their daws strike for 3 to 18 points of damage and Lheir bite 
inflicts 2 to 20 points of damage* 

Habitat Society: Slaadi have a hierarchiai society Their caste 
system is rigid because the strong will simply destroy the weak 
for disobedience: lesser slaadi are forced to be their servants. 
Reds and blues aid each other only in extreme emergencies. 

Ecology: Although slaadi are inhabitants of the outer planes* and 
are frequently found travelling the lower planes, they have little 
or nothing to do with the Blood War between the baatezu and the 
tanar'ri.

Giant slugs are huge, omnivorous mutations of the small and be¬ 
nign garden slugs. Their highly developed mouths are capable of 
chewing flesh and well as plants, and they spit a highly corrosive 
add on their food. Most giant slugs are pale gray, with dead 
white underbellies. 


Combat: Giant slugs can bite for ld!2 points of damage, but 
their main attack form is their corrosive add saliva. The add is 
spat at a single target and corrodes any organic tissue (plants or 
animalsl. It will also destroy equipment (saving throw vs, acid). 
The acid inflicts 4d8 points of damage (successful saving throw 
vs. breath weapon for one-half damage). Giant slugs can use this 
breath weapon every round (its acid stores are never used up). 
Slugs are not very accurate with this attack; the first shot has 
only a 10% chance of hitting. The success of subsequent shots 
depends on the distance to the target—the base chance of hitting 
is 90% at a distance of ten yards, with a -10% penalty per addi¬ 
tional ten yards. If the slug misses, the acid hits 10 feet from the 
desired target (determine randomly which direction). Note that 
giant slugs are impervious to this acid spittle. 

Giant slugs are immensely strong and can batter down doors 
and wooden buildings in seconds. They have no bones and can 
squeeze through holes and crevasses normally impassible to 
much smaller predators. For example, a party of adventurers 
might seek cover in a large stone building, while taunting the 
slowly approaching slug behind them. To their astonishment, the 
huge creature enters through the same doorway the party did and 
begins to send acid everywhere. 

The rasping tongue of a giant slug enables it to burrow through 
1 foot of earth or 6 inches of wood per round, making most 
standard barricades useless against it. 


Because of their lack of bones and their thick, rubbery hides, 
giant slugs are not harmed by blunt weapons or spells that cause 
crushing or impact damage. Only edged and pointed weapons 
and magical attacks, can harm a giant slug. 

Habitat/Society: Giant slugs can be found in any wet and dark 
environment, including deserted dungeons, swamps, and rain 
forests. Giant slugs are solitary creatures and speak no language. 
They are barely sentient, exhibiting only rudimentary instinctive 
reactions when confronted. 

Ecology: No one has ever found a good use for giant slugs, ex¬ 
cept maybe as huge garbage disposals. They have no known 
predators. They will eat anything—plants, carrion, garbage— 
but prefer warm, living flesh when they can catch it. Since giant 
slugs have such huge appetites, they rarely attach smaller crea¬ 
tures, such as squirrels and monkeys, which they have a hard 
time seeing anyway. Even cm a good day, they must usually sup¬ 
plement their feedings with some vegetation. 

Normal slugs have a nasty reaction to salt when it is sprinkled 
on them. They dry up and die in ld4 + l rounds. If is unlikely 
that this technique is adaptable to the giant variety but some fab¬ 
rication and summoning spells might be adaptable if there ever 
seemed to be a need for it. 

For now, giant slugs remain a very real danger in jungles, for¬ 
ests, and dungeons everywhere.

Snakes are long, slender reptiles that can be found anywhere in 
the entire world, even in the coldest arctic regions. 

There are basically two types of snakes, in all manner of sizes. 
The poisonous snakes make up tor their relatively smaller size 
with deadly venoms, while the larger constrictors squeeze their 
victims to death, Both types sleep far days after eating. All 
snakes shed their skin several times each year. All snakes in this 
entry share the following characteristics:

Snakes fear fire and will retreat from open flames, suffering a

Amphtsbaena 

These monsters have heads at both ends, and both heads are 
armed with poisonous fangs. The creature travels by grasping 
one of its necks and rolling like a hoop. It can attack with both 
heads, each head attacking a separate target. Victims failing to 
make a saving throw vs. poison when bitten die instantly. Am- 
phisbaena are immune to cold-based attacks. 

Boalisk 

The boalisk is a tropical constrictor snake with a gaze attack. 
Any creature meeting its gnze (failing a saving throw vs. petrifi¬ 
cation! is infected with a magical rotting disease, identical to that 
inflicted by a mummy Characters refusing to look at the boalisk 
automatically avoid its gaze but suffer a — 4 penalty to their AC. 
Surprised victims always meet its gaze and gain no saving throw. 
The boalisk can use its gszc on a single victim each round in addi- 
tion to normal biting and constriction attacks. 

Constrictor Snake 

Constrictors of all sizes hide in the branches of trees, waiting pa¬ 
tiently until they can slowly lower themselves or suddenly drop 
onto their unsuspecting victims. Once they strike, the victim is 
constricted automatically suffering damage every round, Con¬ 
stricted humanoid creatures can escape the coils of normal con¬

Anyone who attempts to tree a captive by hacking at the con¬ 
strictor has a 20% chance of striking the victim instead {roll nor¬ 
mal damage and apply it to the victim), .Area spells like fireball 
will likewise affect both combatants, but target-specific spells 
like charm monster and magic missile are more precise. 

Common constrictor species include anacondas, boas, and re¬ 
ticulate pythons, all of which can reach lengths of 30 feet. Their 
skin is valuable, with an unblemished skm selling for as much as 

100 gp. 

Some constrictor snakes are known as birdcharmers; these in¬ 
nately magical snakes can mesmerize their prey by swaying slow¬ 
ly and steadily while staring down their victims. Creatures of 
animal intelligence or less must make a saving throw against par- 
alyzation or be effectively paralyzed for as long as the snake con¬ 
tinues to sway and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. 

Giant Constrictor Snake 

Giant constrictor snakes are larger and much stronger than their 
smaller cousins. It requires the combined efforts oi 60 total points 
of Strength (the coiled victim plus outside help) to extricate 
someone from a giant constrictor's steel grasp. 

The skin of a giant constrictor snake is too thick and stiff to be 
workable, and is valuable only as armor, not for decoration. An 
uncured hide can fetch 20 gp, 

Snow serpents are a particularly large and dangerous form of 
giant constrictor snake, one adapted to life in a sub-arctic di¬ 
mate. These furred white snakes hide their 100-foot bodies in the 
snow bodies and wait for prey to pass by. When it does, they 
spring up and coil their loops around the victims- After that, 
snow serpents automatically bite for 2d 10 points of damage each 
round. Those in its coils are helpless. Snow serpents are very rare 
and have the following statistics: AC 6, MV 9, HD 10, THAC0 
11 r SZ G (100' long), ML average (8-10), XP 2,000, Their pelt is 
worth 2,000 gp. In all other respects they are similar to other gi¬ 
ant constrictor snakes. 

Heway 

These intelligent snakes have slimy, poisonous skins that they use 
to foul wells and oases. After swimming in a body of water for 
several hours and releasing its poison, it slinks off to wait for its 
prey to arrive. A creature drinking water poisoned by a heway 
must make a successful saving throw vs. poison at +2 or suffer

30 points damage within 3d6 minutes and be paralyzed for td6 
hours, Creatures that make their saving throws suffer 15 points 
of damage. Even animals that survive the initial effects are often 
doomed to die of dehydration. 

Many humans and animals attack heways on sight, but it can 
defend itself with its hypnotic stare, which has a powerful effect 
any creature failing a saving throw vs + paralyzation will follow 
the heway to its lair and allow itself to be devoured. The he way 
sometimes uses this stare simply to immobilize a menacing crea¬ 
ture. It then leaves the area while the hypnotized creature re¬ 
mains stationary for ld6 turns, 

Heway are innate cowards and avoid contact with other ani- 
mals. It is a weak fighter, its bite is not venomous, and its jaws 
are weak, its preferred food is small animal carrion* Simply 
touching heway skin has no effect; the poison must be ingested.

■ A successful saving throw means no damage. 

Typical varieties of poisonous snakes include the asp. cobra, 
copperhead, coral snake, death adder, krait. mamba, puff adder, 
rattlesnake, sidewinder, and water moccasin. 

Some cobras and sidewinders hunt by night and can track 
warmblooded prey by body heat as well as by sight. They have 
the equivalent of 30-foot infra vision. Black mambas are the fast¬ 
est known snakes and can reach 30 across open ground, 

Giant Poisonous Snake 

Giant poisonous snakes cause death in one round if their victims 
fail a saving throw vs. poison. Some varieties inflict 3-18 points 
of damage even if the saving throw is made. 

The giant cobra is an example of a variant, giant poisonous 
snake. Its venom results in death 2-8 rounds after a successful 
strike: if the victim makes a saving throw at =2 he suffers only 
10 points of damage. Giant cobras mesmerize prey as birdchar- 
mer snakes do (see above), They can kill and eat an entire goat or 
a demihuman up to halfling or gnome size. Some varieties of gi¬ 
ant weasel can hunt them successfully, and jungle giants consider 
giant cobras a delicacy, as do some elven tribesmen. 

Giant Sea Snake 

Found only in tropical waters* the giant sea snake is the only type 
of snake that is both constricting and poisonous, Its constricting 
grasp on small ships can crush them in 10 rounds. Sea snakes 
attack ships only when they are hungry (20% chance). Their poi¬ 
sonous bite is deadly in 1-4 rounds. Sea snakes are fully capable 
of diving to great depths, and their nostrils (on the top of their 
snouts) have membranes that automatically seal them under¬ 
water. 

From time to time giant sea snakes gather in huge floating 
masses of hundreds or thousands of snakes, often 100 yards wide 
and 30 miles long. These may be mating rituals or they may be 
seasonal migrations: the actual reason is unknown. 


Spitting Snake 

Spitting varieties of snakes bite their victims and can shoot poi¬ 
sonous spittle at a single target within 30 feet. Their poison is 
identical to normal poisonous snakes {see above). Typical species 
include the African spitting cobra, which can spit up to 15 feet. 
Its spittle can blind victims that fail a saving throw vs. poison. 
The blindness wears off after 2-12 hours. 

Jacuti (Tree Snakes) 

Many of the above land snakes can be encountered as tree 
snakes* also known as jaculi. These subspecies are simply arbore¬ 
al varieties of other types of snakes that have adapted to life in a 
forest canopy. They have chameleonTike camouflage abilities 
and can leap onto their prey from 50 feet above ground: oppo¬ 
nents suffer a -4 penalty to surprise rolls. 

Some tree snakes have broad, flat heads with razor spines or 
barbs that make their initial impact particularly potent (double 
normal bite damage). After their initial flying attack, they must 
depend on biting or constriction attacks or climb back into the 
trees to leap again. 

lacuit snakes include the poisonous boomslang and the emer¬ 
ald tree boa. Many jaculi species prey on other snakes. 

Elder Serpents 

Ancient snakes are said to gain wisdom with age, giving them 
Semi- to Low intelligence (2-7). They gain an additional Hit Die 
and the ability to speak (with a lisp). Elder serpent venom is more 
concentrated than that of its younger cousins (death in 1-4 
rounds maximum, saving throws at —4). They suffer no modifier 
to morale when faced with open flames, Elder serpents have a 
measure of cunning and value glittering objects; they have trea¬ 
sure, type W. 

Elder serpents can paralyze prey as birdcatchers do (see con¬ 
strictors above). In the case of elder boalisks, their gaze has two 
simultaneous effects and victims are entitled to two saving 
throws. All elder serpents can hypnotize people as well as ani¬ 
mals with their paralyzing stare. 

The largest elder serpent is called the Grand Snakemaster, and 
is said to be immortal. When it sheds its skin, the discarded skin 
is rumored to possess healing powers. Those who eat it are said 
to gain wisdom, but since the Grand Snakemaster has never been 
seen, the truth of these rumors is questionable.

Winged serpents, sometimes called spark snakes, are colorful 
reptiles that dwell in Zakhara's forests and jungles. Winged ser¬ 
pents come in many colors, ranging from sky blue and emerald 
green to raspberry red. They are supported by invisibly swift, 
gossamer wings, making them resemble reptilian hummingbirds. 
When their delicate wings are folded back, winged serpents can 
spider climb at will. 


Combat: Winged serpents move with liquid grace and devastat¬ 
ing speed. They always receive a bonus to initiative. 

The bite of a winged serpent inflicts ld4 points of damage and 
injects the victim with a corrosive, acidic fluid. This poison has 
an onset time of 1 round and Inflicts an additional 2dS points of 
damage for the following 2 rounds (half damage if a save vs, poi¬ 
son is made). 

By far the most dangerous attack of these reptiles is their 
sparking breath weapon. Their wings beat so quickly that they 
build up a static charge from the ambient air (especially in the 
humid forest}, A winged serpent can discharge this static electric¬ 
ity from its mouth in a spark shower a cloud of dancing sparks 
and electrical energy 10 feet in diameter. Those caught in the area 
of effect take 2d8 (2-16} points of damage (half if a save vs. 
breath weapon is made). The spark shower will also ignite any 
exposed flammable objects, like clothes, hair, dry wood, or lamp 
oil. Once it has been discharged, It takes one rum for a winged 
serpent to build its static charge back up. All winged serpents are 
immune to electricity. 

Winged serpents are vulnerable to fire-based attacks (especial¬ 
ly their delicate wings), against which they save at penalty of ~ 
2. If a winged serpent fails its saving throw against a fire attack, 
assume that Its wings are incinerated. Although this won't affect 
its ability to bite a victim, the serpent cannot use its breath weap¬ 
on until the wings grow back. 

Habitat'Society; Winged serpents must eat constantly in order to 
survive. They flit about the jungle in small flocks, searching for 
tropica] fruits, from which they draw their nourishment. A 
winged serpent will fly up to one and inject it with corrosive ven¬ 
om. The venom breaks down the fruit into a soft, juicy mixture* 
partially digesting the fruit while it still remains in its skin. The 
serpent will then suck out the fruity pulp through the incisions 
made by its fangs. A typical winged serpent will eat roughly 10 
times its weight in fruit each day, just to stay alive. 



Winged serpents mate as often as they eat (he., incessantly), 
although they do not care for their young, which are bom live 
and wingless. They are bom with their spider climbing ability, 
which helps them climb fruit trees and search for food. The 
young are dark green in color to help them blend in better with 
the foliage, gaining their chromatic hues only after their wings 
mature. During the first few months of life, winged serpents are 
extremely vulnerable to an entire host of predators that roam the 
jungle heights (including mundane snakes, monkeys, and giant 
insects). Vestigial wings appear after a month of life, and become 
fully functional after three months. 

Winged serpents have no permanent lair and hoard no trea¬ 
sure. 

Ecology: Winged serpents play an important role in the jungle 
ecology. Like giant bees, they transport pollen from fruit tree to 
fruit tree and help with the distribution of seeds throughout the 
jungle. As adults, they have no natural enemies. 

If captured during their first month of life before their wings 
have matured, they make excellent (if expensive) pets. They must 
consume a great quantity of fruit to survive, eating on average 
100 gp worth of fruit each month (this cost might be reduced if a 
large orchard is available). A skilled animal trainer can teach a 
winged serpent up to three tasks or tricks per point of intelli¬ 
gence* which the creature will gladly perform (provided a supply 
of fresh fruit is constantly at hand}, They can even be trained as 
guardians, although rogues have quickly discovered that unless 
they are extremely well-trained* they can be easily distracted by a 
decoy of aromatic, fresh fruit. 

Few useful by-products can be obtained from a winged ser¬ 
pent, Their poison decomposes almost immediately after expo¬ 
sure to air, and their hide is too thin and fragile to serve as good 
leather. Their wings* however. If powdered and mixed with ink* 
can be used to inscribe a protection from lightning scroll.

Spectres are powerful undead that haunt the most desolate and 
deserted of places. They hate all life and tight. 

Spectres appear as semitransparent beings and are often mis¬ 
taken for haunts or ghosts. Unlike most undead, spectres retain 
the semblance and manner of dress of their former life and can be 
recognized by old friends or through paintings of the persons 
they used to be. 

Combat: Spectres exist primarily on the Negative Materia! 
plane and can therefore be attacked by beings on the Prime Mate¬ 
rial plane only with magical weapons. Daylight makes spectres 
powerless by weakening their ties to the Negative Material plane. 
The chilling touch of a spectre drains energy from living crea¬ 
tures, A successful attack inflicts 1-8 points of damage and drains 
two life energy levels from the victim. Any being totally drained of 
life energy by a spectre becomes a full-strength spectre under the 
control of the spectre which drained him. The victim loses all con¬ 
trol of his personality and may become more or less powerful than 
before, depending on his level and class before becoming a spectre. 
Spectres are immune to all steep, charm, hold , and cold-based 
spells, as well as poisons and paralyzation attacks. Holy water 
inflicts 2-8 points of damage when it strikes a spectre. The water 
can be splashed on a spectre successfully, A raise dead spell ap¬ 
parently reverses the undead status, destroying the spectre imme¬ 
diately if a saving throw versus spell is failed. 

Habitat Society: Most spectres are solitary, but some enclaves 
exist where a particularly powerful or lucky spectre has managed 
to drain mortals of life. This lead spectre is known as the master 
spectre (always with maximum hit points per die), while the oth¬ 
ers are known collectively as the followers. In this arrangement, 



the master spectre almost never engages enemies personally, but 
instead sends his minions in for the kill. Mortals drained of life by 
follower spectres are subservient to the master spectre, not the 
followers. Note that if the master spectre is slain, all followers 
become independent and can travel anywhere they wish in hopes 
of becoming master spectres themselves. Once a character be¬ 
comes a spectre, recovery is nearly impossible, requiring a spe¬ 
cial quest. 

Spectres hate light and all life, as both remind them of their 
undead existence. They are therefore encountered only in places 
of extreme darkness and desolation, like long-abandoned ruins, 
dungeons, and subterranean sewers. 

Contrary to popular mythology, spectres remain highly intelli¬ 
gent and generally rational after the transformation to undeath. 
Life makes them lament their unlife, and they bear a strong ha¬ 
tred for all those lucky enough to live and truly die. 

Spectres have enough cunning to plan their attacks, and rival 
vampires in their skill at remaining hidden from the general pop¬ 
ulace. 

Ecology: No one knows who the first spectre was or how it 
came to be: the few facts detailed above are all that is known 
with any degree of certainty.

And rosphinx 

Androsphinxes are huge, winged mythological creatures with the 
bodies of male lions and man-fike facial features. They can speak 
the languages of common and all sphinxes. 

Combat: The male, or andro-, sphinx is the most powerful of 
the sphinxes. Its huge paws can kill a normal man with just one 
swipe* If brute force is not successful, an androsphinx can cast 
spells as if a 6th-level priest. Note that most androsphinxes use 
these spells for healing and defense rather than damage and at¬ 
tack. 

The androsphinx has another special weapon as well—his bel¬ 
lowing roar* It can roar three times per day, but must be very 
angry to do- so. The first time an angry androsphinx roars, all 
creatures within 360 yards must roll successful saving throws vs. 
wands or flee in panic for three turns. When an already angry 
androsphinx is continually molested, even after bellowing once, 
it can roar even louder causing all creatures within 200 yards to 
roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be paralyzed 
with fright for ld4 rounds. In addition, any creatures within 30 
yards of this second roar are automatically deafened for 2d6 
rounds (unless they are deaf already or have protected hearing 
organs). Any creature foolish enough to anger an androsphinx 
further will unleash his third and final roar with devastating ef¬ 
fects, All creatures within 240 yards must successfully roll saving 
throws vs. spell or lose 2d4 points of Strength for 2d4 rounds (use 
-1 point equals for characters with exceptional 

Strength). In addition to the weakness effects, any creature with¬ 
in 30 yards of the androsphinx is knocked over unless it is S feet 
tall or larger. Creatures knocked over suffer 2dB points of dam¬ 
age and must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon to 
avoid being stunned tor 2d6 rounds. The force of this third roar is 
so powerful that stone within 30 yards cracks under the strain, 
unless it successfully saves vs. crushing blow, 

Habitat/Society; Androsphinxes are the most solitary of the 
sphinxes. They shun gynosphinxes because they are jealous of 
the higher intelligence of their female counterparts, and find their 
neutral disposition a bit hard to deal with. However, most an- 
drosphinxes eventually succumb to the advances of a gynosphinx 
at least once in their lives. 


Ecology: What is strangest about androsphinxes is not their 
combination lion/human appearance (as there are many such 
cross-mutations found in the world), but their apparent lack of 
purpose. They arc by far the strongest of the sphinxes, but unlike 
their counterparts, have no true pattern of behavior universal to 
all androsphinxes. They despise communicating with humans 
and hate riddles (mostjy because gynosphinxes love them so 
much). It is therefore suggested by those knowledgeable in myth¬ 
ological beasts and desert lore that androsphinxes are the guard¬ 
ians of the sphinxes, evil (hieraco-), neutral (gyno- and crio-), 
and good (andro-b 



324 













Sphinx 


Certainly, androsphinxes are the lifelong adversaries of the 
hieracosphinxes, but they almost always let the defeated enemy 
go free instead of finishing the kill (often with a roar or two at the 
fleeing sphinxes' behinds). 

In short, androsphinxes are free-roaming sphinxes sworn to 
defend other sphinxes against other races, namely men and their 
ilk. They have been known to bargain with men on occasion, but 
are the least greedy of the sphinxes, and are the only sphinxes 
likely to take offense at such offerings if made by characters with 
low Charismas or evil alignments, 

Criosphinxes 

Criosphinxes have the bodies of winged lions, but they have the 
heads of rams. They are always male. They can speak their own 
dialect of sphinx, as well as that spoken by a ndro/gynosphinxes 
and the languages of animals. 

Combat? Criosphinxes attack with their two paws or with a 
head butt with their ram s horns. Because they cast no spells and 
are not the brightest of sphinxes, their bargains with other beings 
are limited to "safe passage or die." They love treasure and lust 
after gy nosphinxes constantly. Plenty of wealth, or knowledge of 
the location of a gynosphinx's lair, is always enough for advert 
turers to avoid confrontation with criosphinxes. 

Habitat Society: Criosphinxes prize wealth and usually seek to 
extort passers-by for safe passage in exchange for a hefty bribe. 
They are sometimes found in packs of two or more, but only be¬ 
cause all of these sphinxes are looking for the same gynosphinx. 
They often follow other criosphinxes, even if they have no idea 
whether or not the leader really knows where he’s going. When a 
number of criosphinxes find a gynosphinx, the first order of busi¬ 
ness is to restrain their prey. Usually pushing boulders in front of 
the lair with their huge horns is sufficient. Then the criosphinxes 
butt horns like rams, except these creatures do their fighting in 
the air. The winner gets the prize. 

More often than not, however, criosphinxes begin their com¬ 
bat immediately upon finding their quarry, and inevitably the 
victor strides lorth to find the gynosphinx gone. While the crios- 
phinxes often find themselves richer for their trouble, as the 
gynosphinx rarely sees the need for material wealth while it is 
fleeing, it is only a poor reward indeed for their often decades- 
long quest. 

Ecology: Criosphinxes are obviously just further mutations of 
the already mysterious sphinx form. Their ability to speak with 
animals seems to be an evolutionary necessity, as criosphinxes 
are particularly fond of warm wooded areas, often bordering on 
the desert lands preferred by gynosphinxes. 

Cyno sphinxes 

The gynosphinx is the female counterpart of the androsphinx, 
having a winged lion's body and human-like facial features. 
Gynosphinxes are not nearly as powerful as androsphinxes, but 
they are much more knowledgeable* clever, and wise. Gynos- 
phinxes speak ail sphinx languages as well as common. 

Combat: Gynosphinxes can attack with two paws, but prefer 
to bargain with their opponents. They help strangers only if they 
are paid. They accept payment for services rendered or knowl¬ 
edge and advice given, in the form of gems (preferred), jewelry, 
magic, or knowledge. Knowledge that would be of special inter¬ 
est to a gynosphinx is the location of an androsphinx, but they 
accept fine prose, poetry lore, or a good riddle. 

If anyone breaks a bargain with a gynosphinx, he is subject to 
attack and the gynosphinx won t hesitate to devour the victim if 
it wins the fight. The gynosphinx can cast the following spells 


once per day: detect magic, read magic, read languages , detect 
invisibility, locate object * dispel 1 magic, c lair audience, clairvoy¬ 
ance, remove curse * and legend lore . It can also use each symbol 
once per week. Note that a gynosphinx is very intelligent and can 
use these spells in many ways, if a bargaining group of adventur^ 
ers steps back to discuss their plans among themselves, the 
gynosphinx will growl a little and cast claimudience to listen in. 

Habitat/Soriety: Gynosphinxes are solitary by nature, but not 
by choice. They spend most of their lives avoiding the advances 
of criosphinxes (which they detest) and hieracosphinxes (which 
they fear), and searching high and low for an androsphinx. 

Gynosphinxes are intelligent enough to actively seek out ru¬ 
ins and mystical places* like forgotten temples and such, which 
they immediately occupy. Using their many spells to learn as 
much as possible about the setting, they then wait for the next 
group of travelers, pilgrims* or adventurers to come by and 
hope that they've encountered an androsphinx in their travels 
or have spells or magical items that might be usable for just 
such a purpose. 

Ecology: Gynosphinxes own the dubious distinction of being 
the only female sphinx. A gynosphinx mated with an andros- 
phinx will produce another androsphinx or gynosphinx (even 
chances for both). A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only 
produces another male criosphinx, while mating with a hieracos- 
phinx produces similarly displeasing results. 

Fortunately gynosphinxes are much smarter than all of their 
counterparts and can avoid otherwise compromising situations 
through trickery and outright deceit. Unfortunately* they are 
among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running, and 
the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up 
the chase once a gynosphinx has been located. 

Hieracosphinxes 

Hier a cosphinxes are the only evil members of their breed. They 
have the bodies of lions, but the wings and head of hawks. They 
are always males. They speak the languages of the other sphinx¬ 
es, and some (Z0% ) also speak common. 

Combat: Hieracosphinxes do not cast spells* much like the 
criosphinxes* but make up for their weaknesses with tenacious 
evil and viciousness. Their paws and sharp beaks are deadly in 
combat, and they have been known to swoop down on victims. 

Habitat/Soriety: Hieracosphinxes live in hilly regions exclu¬ 
sively, dwelling in caves overlooking the nearby deserts. They 
delight in evil and sometimes gather In bands of as many as six to 
do their vile business. Most often when a band of hieracos- 
phinxes is encountered, it is hot in pursuit of an androsphinx. 
which they hate with all of their beings. Only in numbers can 
they hope to defeat so powerful an adversary, and these sphinxes 
never believe in honor or playing fair. While it ts true that a vic¬ 
torious androsphinx sometimes lets the defeated flee (in the vain 
hope that the battle may change the losers’ dispositions), a de¬ 
feated androsphinx is always ripped to pieces when the hieracos¬ 
phinxes are numerous enough and lucky enough to win the fight. 

Hieracosphiaxes also spend much of their time searching for a 
gynosphinx to mate with, but prefer to kill an androsphinx and 
inhabit his lair until a gynosphinx eventually arrives (usually by 
following old rumors and legends)* It is worthwhile to note that 
there are more hieracosphinxes than criosphinxes. 

Ecology: Hieracosphinxes are belligerent mutations of un¬ 
known origin. It is believed that they were created by elder gods 
of evil merely to wreak havoc on the other, more pleasant 
sphinxes described above.

Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below 
ground. Most listed here are poisonous and bite prey first, be¬ 
cause unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair. 

Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into 
two categories, web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens 
and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller 
bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs. 

Hairy Spider 

These are the vicious, black, hunting spiders that are found in 
jungles, tombs, caverns, and throughout the Underdark. Though 
spin no webs, they can move readily In the webs of other spiders, 
and they are immune to all known spider venoms, 

Hairy spiders hunt in groups, swarming over victims to bite. 
Up to 40 hairy spiders can swarm a human-sized victim, and bite 
with a + 5 bonus to attack rolls once they are attached. Hairy 
spiders are remarkably resistant to crushing damage; rolling or 
crashing into walls is ineffective at removing or destroying hairy 
spiders. They must be individually struck or torn away. 

Hairy spiders are sometimes used as familiars, especially by 
drow wizards. They can carry small items and walk on walls and 
ceilings; they have 60-foot infravision and are not afraid of fire. 
Some (40% ) of these spiders can detect invisibility: they have a 4 
in 6 chance, once per round. These familiars are sometimes given 
treasure by their masters. 

Victims receive a + 2 bonus to saving throws vs. the hairy spi¬ 
ders 1 weak poison. It the saving throw fails, the victims AC and 
attack rolls are penalized by L and Dexterity is penalized by -3 
with respect to Dexterity checks. These effects begin one round 
after the bite and last for ld4 + l rounds. 

Large Spider 

Large spiders are web-spinners that build strong, sticky webs, 
and often lurk nearby waiting for victims to get stuck while ex¬ 
amining the beautiful constructions of their own spinning. A be¬ 
ing with Strength 19 or more is unaffected by the webs. For each 


point of Strength less than 19, it takes one round to break free of 
the webs (for example, a PC with Strength 15 can break free in 
four rounds). As many spiders as possible will attack the defense¬ 
less victim during its struggle to free itself. Entangled characters 
can be attacked with a +4 bonus to hit, and lose all Armor Class 
adjustments due to Dexterity 

The large spider's poison is Type A, the onset time is 15 min¬ 
utes, Victims take 15 points of damage, or no damage if a saving 
throw vs. poison (with a *2 to the roll! is successful. 

Huge Spider 

Huge spiders are hunting spiders that prefer to hide in camou¬ 
flaged tunnels and holes and wait to leap as much as 30 feet 
through the air at unsuspecting victims. Their opponents suffer a 
^6 to surprise rolls when attacked in this manner. 

Huge spiders also posses Type A poison, with the same effects 
as that of a targe spider. Victims receive a +1 to saving throws 
vs. the poison of the huge spider. 

The watch spider is a specially bred, huge spider used as a 
guard animal in cellars, warehouses, and some drow homes. It 
has Low Intelligence (5-7) and can be trained to obey a master, 
not attack beings designated by the master, and to disable spell- 
casters. Their venom has an onset time of 1-2 rounds and causes 
paralysis for 2d4 turns, unless the victim makes a successful sav¬ 
ing throw vs. poison (with a +1 on the roll). If starved for long 
periods, they often eat paralyzed prey. 

Giant Spider 

Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web¬ 
spinning large spiders. Their poison is Type F, which causes im¬ 
mediate death if the victim fails the saving throw. 

The giant water spider is a small version (Moot diameter, 3 + 3 
HD) of the giant spider, It Jives in a burrow in a body of fresh 
water, and fills its burrow with bubbles of air. These spiders drag 
prey underwater to their lairs, where they can safely wrap it in 
cocoons for later repasts. It is faster than a normal giant spider 


526 








Spider 


(movement rate 15), but cannot travel through webs. It is only 
semi-intelligent (2-4) anti has treasure as a huge spider; its bite 
causes only ld4 damage plus poison. 

The Hying spider, sometimes just called a hunting spider ls a 
giant, winged, hunting spider. They are sometimes trained as 
guard animals, especially by the drow, They are 10 feet in diame¬ 
ter and have 3+3 Hit Dice. Its normal movement rate is 9 , and its 
great gossamer wings allow it to fly at the same rate (MG D), 
These spiders can also leap up to 70 feet, and fall any distance 
without harm upon landing, as long as they use their wings. 
Hunting spiders have Type A poison, just as a large spider, with 
the same damage and saving throw adjustment. 

The giant trap door spider is a hunting spider which builds 
tunnels and surprises prey like a huge spider; it is brown or gold¬ 
en, with red strips around its legs. On a successful attack roll, the 
spider can grab a victim and attempt to drag it into its lair, A 
victim can get free by making a successful Strength check, with a 
-2 penalty, or be freed by companions, if their Strength totals 20 
or more. The victim can make no attacks, 

A giant trap door spider has 4 + 4 Hit Dice and causes 2d4 dam¬ 
age per bite. Its poison causes an additional id6 points of damage 
if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison. Though it does not 
build webs, it can travel through webs of other spiders, and it can 
shoot web strands up to 3 feet. The web strands require normal 
attack rolls to hit; they cause no damage, but entangle a victim 
for ld4 rounds. 

The steeder is a giant hunting spider with tarantula markings, 
4 + 4 Hit Dice, and a movement rate of 12, It does not spin webs 
and cannot move in them, but its feet exude a sticky substance 
which allows it to ding to precarious surfaces, even if only one 
foot is touching the surface. The steeder also uses the secretions 
(50% of the time) to cling to prey; this requires an attack roll 
from the steeder, against AC 10 for the victim, adjusted only for 
magic and Dexterity. A victim can escape by making a successful 
Strength or Dexterity roll with a *"10 penalty. While held, the 
victim suffers a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls and is 
automatically bitten once per round. 

Duergar dwarves use steeders as mounts, fitting the spiders 
with complex saddles and control straps. A steeder can leap 240 
feel, even with a rider Leaps are considered charging attacks, A 
steeder moves on walls and ceilings at half its normal rate; 
duergar saddles are built for this kind of motion. 

Phase Spider 

Phase spiders are web-spinners with a raised thorax and a 
human-fike head; they are often confused with neogi or driders. 
They have a unique ability to phase m and out of the Prime mate¬ 
rial plane They phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single 
round. This gives them a —3 modifier on initiative rolls; if a 
phase spider wins initiative by more than 4, it attacks and phases 
out before its opponent has a chance to strike back. Then too, a 
phase spider usually phases into existence behind its chosen vic¬ 
tim, so they get a + 4 modifier for attacking from behind. Phase 
spiders flee to the Ethereal plane when outmatched: there, they 
gain only a -1 modifier to initiative and can be attacked every 
round, regardless of the initiative result. 

Phase spiders have Type F poison, and victims receive a “2 
penalty on saving throws against iL 

Sword Spider 

This giant hunting spider is native to jungles, but has been intro¬ 
duced into the Underdark by drow traders. It has a sleek, hairy, 
black body with brown stripes. Its legs have bony plates with 
sharp raised ridges that cut like sword blades. 



Against formidable prey, a sword spider leaps horizontally as 
far as 30 feet, and lands legs forward, impaling its prey. Only one 
attack roll is made for the creature. If the attack is successful, the 
victim is struck by a number of legs based on its size; size S, three 
legs; size M, four legs; size L, five legs; size H, six legs; size G, alt 
eight legs. If the spiders leap is greater than 20 feet, each leg re¬ 
ceives a +1 bonus to damage. Any upward attack against the 
leaping spider receives a -4 to the attack roll, due to the impal¬ 
ing blades which protect the spider. 

Gargantuan Spider 

The gargantuan spider, also called a whisper spider, is a hunting 
spider with red eyes, a black body and two gray stripes along its 
abdomen. They usually live in huge webs in a forest or a cave, 
keeping treasure from prey in a small hole, or in the bole of a 
tree. The whisper spider has 8 +8 Hit Dice. It can flatten itself to 
become S0% undetectable; it is so silent that opponents suffer a 
-5 penalty to surprise rolls* 

Using its webbing, it can make a false spider, a flapping ban¬ 
ner, a filmy veil or any shape it has ever seen; it uses these to 
mislead prey, The spider can make a web net to trap prey or it 
can shoot web strands up to 2 feet to bind a foe. Either attack 
treats the spiders opponent as AC 10 and prevents the spider 
from making a melee attack that round, A victim caught by 
webbing is treated as if caught in a web spell. When bitten, a 
victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a 
penalty of “2, or fall into a coma for 2d4 turns. 

Giant marine spiders are gargantuan spiders with 7+7 HU 
Dice, which live in burrows near bodies of saltwater. Like their 
freshwater cousins, they carry prey to their lairs; though they 
collect no treasure, their lairs may contain inddental items from 
victims. They have type F poison, and do not share the whisper 
spider's special abilities.

Sprites are shy and reclusive faerie people, related to other faerie-folk, 
like brownies and leprechauns. There are several varieties, including 
pixies and nixies. Most have small. semitransparent wings, and elven fea¬ 
tures. 

Normal sprites have distinctly elven features and live in meadows and 
wooded glens. The wingless sea sprites make their homes on colorful cor¬ 
al reefs, living in harmony with the sea creatures, protecting the reefs' 
delicate environment, and frolicking in the waves. The naturally invisible 
pixies are perhaps the most intelligent and mischievous of the iaeriesi 
they dwell in idyllic woodlands and delight in harassing travelers with 
their pranks. Nixies arc v/aler sprites (hat live in freshwater Jakes, and, 
while they harbor no grudges against humankind, they delight in enstav* 
ing men as their beasts of burden. Other sylvan creatures related to 
sprites include the swift atomies and the mischievous grigs, bath forest- 
dwellers. 

Combat: Sprites hate evil and ugliness, and are capable of stout militan¬ 
cy, should their secluded homes be invaded by ores or worse. They lighl 
with long, slim swords which do damage as a human-sized dagger, nr 
their own special bows. Bows have a range half that of a human short 
bow and do only half as much damage {1-3 points!. The tips of their ar¬ 
rows are coated with a special ointment concocted by ihe sprites. Any 
creature struck by the drugged arrows, regardless of level, race, ur magic 
resistance, must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall into a deep sleep 
lasting Idb hours. Normally sprites do nothing more than take their vic¬ 
tims to safe a place very far away [often confiscating their Weapons in the 
process), though evil creatures may be slain. 

Habitat Society: Sprites prefer to avoid other intelligent beings and live in 
places where they can have many celebrations, parties, and gatherings. 
They gather on most moonlit nights for singing and dancing, land sprites 
in the glens, and water sprites in the surf. Land sprites live in sylvan 
woodlands, they monitor and protect forests and secluded glens. Water 
sprites protect their watery territories equally well. 

Most land-dwelling species of sprite are immortal and never die unless 
killed. The sprites' diminutive size and their dangerous environments 
keep sprite populations low. 

Sprite [standard 

Sprites usually speak only their own language, common, and dven, 
but seem to get along with woodland mammals and other creatures any¬ 
way. Humans otten mistake sprites for butterflies at a distance, and it is 
guessed that the majority of forest creatures also think of the fair sprites 
in this way. 


Combat: Sprites can become mrisibfe at will and detect good/evil within 
50 yards, so they are hard to deceive, evade, or capture. When invisible, 
sprites get +2 to attack rolls against opponents, who suffer a —4 penalty 
to hit the sprites. 

Habitat'Society: Sprites are very flighty, and find even elves much too 
serious about most woodland affairs. 

Only druids deal with sprites regularly. Some druids even receive a lit¬ 
tle of their training in the company of a few sprites Most sprites love 
druids, for their neutral alignment and love for nature make them see the 
forest in much the same way. On rare occasions, sprites associate with 
rangers as well 

Sprites are loosely tribal, electing the best warrior among the group 
(male or female! as the group spokesperson. This leader is recognized as 
the one who makes major decisions and bargains with druids and elves, 
Sprites rarely wait for their leader s decision, often attacking an evil crea¬ 
ture before t he leader can issue any command. 

Ecology: Sprite sleep ointment is concocted from forest mushrooms, The 
ointment must be left to cure in the sun tor seven days. Sprites hollow out 
tree stumps to serve as containers for this rare substance. 

Sprites keep watch on their fellow sprites, so they know who to invite 
to their frequent gatherings. A deserted meadow or glen is never empty 
for more than a decade before a new dan of sprites moves in. 

Sea Sprites 

Sea sprites have fine, cheerful faces, with rounded cheeks and wide, 
tish-like eyes. Their hair is Ihe color and texture of seaweed and reaches 
down to the gills on their necks, which enable sea sprites to breathe water 
as well as air. Their skin is light blue, smooth, and slick. Sea sprites have 
no wings, but webbing grows between their toes and fingers. Sea sprites 
wear bright, eel skin jerkins, and often adorn themselves with ornaments 
crafted From treasures found in the ocean. 

Combat: About bah of the sea sprites encountered carry special cross¬ 
bows. In ihe hands of sea sprites, these crossbows function like light 
crossbows above and below water. Sea sprites coat their crossbow bolts 
in sprite sleep ointment. 

Sea sprites hate and fear sahuagin, and kill those they put to sleep. Air 
breathers are left on a nearby beach provided they have neither harmed 
nor attempted to harm the coral reef. 

Sea sprites can turn invisible at u?ih and detect good/evil within 50 
yards. Three times per day, a sea sprite may cast slow, by touch, at the 
5th level of ability. Once per day, a sea sprite can cast airy water as a 
10th-level spelkaster. 


328 






Sprite 


Sea sprites are 45% likely to be accompanied by Ido large carnivorous 
fish, such as barracudas. These fish act as guards and pets, attacking any 
creature that threatens the sprites, 

HahitalSoriety; Sea sprites live in natural caves in coral reefs, or amid 
large wrecks. Though sea sprites can breathe air. they rarely set foot on 
land. Their homes are cheerfully decorated with a mishmash of seashelk, 
bones, pearls, free^wimming and colorful pet fish, and artifacts taken 
from sunken ships Sea sprites live in small communities of four or five 
families.While each community is led by the eldest male, the true power 
often rests in the hands of his mate. 

Ecology: Sea sprites eat seaweeds, small crustaceans, and fish. They raise 
fish and never deplete the reefs where they live. The only natural enemies 
of sea sprites are sahuagm, Sea sprites usually live for several centuries. 
They sometimes trade with sea elves but never mix socially with them. 

Pixie 

Pixies stand about 2 1 ■'?. feet tall. When visible, they resemble small 
elves, but with longer ears. Pixies have two silver wings, like those of 
moths. They wear bright clothing, often with a cap and a pair of shoes 
with curled and pointed toes. Pixies speak their own language. Common, 
and the language of sprites. 

Combat: Pixies carry sprite-sized swords and bows. They use three types 
of arrows, and shoot them with a +4 bonus to the attack roll. Besides 
standard sprite sleep-arrows, pixies use a war arrow* which inflicts 
ld4+ 1 points of damage, and an arrow which does no physical harm to 
the target. Those hit by this arrow must make a successful saving throw 
vs, spell, or suffer complete loss of memory which can be restored only 
by a heal or a limited wish. 

Pixies can, once per day, use each of the following magical powers, as if 
they were 8th-level mages polymorph self, know alignment , dispel mag¬ 
ic. dancing lights , and ESP They can also do the following once per day 
become visible tor as long as they desire; creaLe illusions with both audial 
and visual components; and cause contusion by touch. Their illusions 
require no concentration and last until magically dispelled. A creature 
attacked with confusion must make a successful saving throw vs. spell, or 
suffer its effects until a remove curse is applied. One pixie in 10 can use 
Off os /rresistih/e dance, also once per day. 

Because pixies are normally invisible, opponents suffer a ^4 penalty to 
attack rolls. A successful dispel magic against Bth-level magic makes any 
pixies, in its area of effect, visible for one round, then they automatically 
become invisible again. They attack while invisible without penalty. 

Ha hit a t Society Pixies live in deep forest caves, dancing in moonlit glades 
to the music of crickets and frogs. They are pranksters and they love to 
lead travelers astray. They use their illusion powers to accomplish this, 
hence the expression "pixie-led" for one who has lost his way. They like to 
frighten maidens, rap on walls, blow out candles, and play in water. 

Pixies love to trick misers into giving away thdr treasure, especially by 
convincing them that something horrible will happen to them If they do 
not. Pixies tarry no treasure, but sometimes have a hoard in thdr lair to 
impress visitors* Pixies use treasure to taunt greedy people, and then play 
merciless pranks on them until they abandon thdr search for the pixies 
fortune. If the victim shows no greed and exhibits a good sense of humor 
about their pranks, the pixies may allow that individual to choose one 
item from their hoard. 

Pixies dwell together in a community of dans or families that seem to 
mimic human customs Each family has a last name, and tamily and com¬ 
munity loyalty is very important to pixies. Their life span is about 300 
years. 

Ecology: Pixies eat fruits and nectar. The most famous by-product of 
pixies is pixie dust, also known as dusf of disappearance. Crushing 50 
pixie wings into a tine powder creates one dose of dust of disappeartmee 
Naturally, pixies frown on lhis use of their wings. 

Nixie 

Nixies have webbed fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver 
eyes. Most are slim and comely, and they have lightly scaled, pale green 
skin and dark green hair. Females are attractive, often twining shells and 
pearl strings in their thick hair, and they modestly dress in tight-fitting 
wraps woven from colorful seaweeds. Males wear loincloths of the same 



materials. Nixies can breathe both water and air; travel on land is possi¬ 
ble, but they prefer not to leave their lakes. Nixies speak their own lan¬ 
guage and the Common tongue. 

Combat: U one or more men approach within 30 feet of a group of nixies, 
the nixies pool their magic to create a powerful charm spell, one such 
spell per every 10 nixies. The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell at 
-2 on the die roll. Before a charmed man enters the water, there is a 75 % 
chance that a dispel magk will break the charm. Once the victim is in the 
water, the chance of dispelling the magic drops to 10% Nixies keep each 
charmed slave for one full year, forcing him to do all their heavy labor, 
but thereafter the charm wears off and the victim is set free. During this 
enslavement, the nixies keep a witter breathing spell on the human cap¬ 
tive. Nixies can cast this spell on any creature, nr dispel it r once per day; 
the spell's duration is one day. 

Male nixies carry daggers and javelins. The javelins are used to spear 
things in the water, or can be thrown. A group of 10 nixies can use a large 
fishing net against adversaries who are in the water with them. Nixies 
make one net attack against AC 10 to ensnare a single man-sized crea¬ 
ture, -2 AC for each additional victim, up to five total victims land AC 
0), Nixies sometimes employ guardian fish in battle 

Even with 25% magic resistance, nixies fear fire and very bright lights, 
so a flaming sword or a spell keeps them at bay. Nixies try to negate 
a coitfmuflJ %ltf spell by summoning small fish to crowd around the light 
and dim it. 

HabitaUSociety: Nixie dwellings are woven from living seaweed and dif¬ 
ficult to detect &lt;5% chance within 20 feet, impossible from farther away). 
Nixies keep giant fish as guards, either 1-2 gar (20%) or 2-5 pike &lt;80%); 
these ate taught to obey simple commands. Small bright, ornamental fish 
are kept as pels and trained to perform elaborate tricks. Trout, bass, and 
catfish are herded as food. Nixies can also summon 10-100 small fish 
which takes 1-3 rounds, 

Nixie tribes have 20-80 members, about one third are youth. Families 
have 4-8 members, and the tribe usually includes 10-15 families, all re¬ 
lated through common ancestors. A nixie tribe controls an area with a 
radius of 3-5 miles; when a tribe gets too large, 2-3 families split off to 
form a new tribe. Nixies live for several centuries. 

Nixie tribes are ruled by the Acquar (water mother), a hereditary posi¬ 
tion held by a direct descendant of the original founding ancestor. She 


329 











Sprite 


decides major disputes and chooses the most apt warrior to he the S *a- 
quar. the warlord responsible for hunting and defense. The Acquar is ad¬ 
vised by a council of elders, whose spokesperson is called the Luquar. the 
keeper of the tribes oral history, Treasures, whether the spoils of war or 
the results of work or luck, are divided equally by the Acquar* Intertribal 
rivalries are often Herce, and females are sometimes kidnapped as brides, 
for nixia- are polygamists, keeping 2-3 wives. Nixies worship water and 
nature powers. 

Ecology: Lakes with nixie tribes art kept clean and well stocked; often, 
human slaves work to improve the environment through the removal of 
trash and obstructions. Nixie artifacts include jewelry of shells, pearfs 
and opals, silk from water spiders, and potions of water breathing. 

Atomic 

Atomies avoid most serious-minded creatures, but mix freely with grigs, 
and are 20% likely to be found in their company, The lightest and quick¬ 
est of all the sprites, atomies are less than 1-toot lalL Atomies have four 
dragonfly-like wings. Their features are eiven. their skin is pale with a 
him of woodland green, Atomic clothing is innately magical, bright and 
festive while at the same time blending with woodland surroundings. 

Atomies have twice the hearing range of humans, and they have infra- 
vision to ^0 feet, Their voices are high-pitched, almost a bee-like buzz. 
Atomies speak their own language and often the languages of sprites, 
pixies, and some broken Common, They can also speak with plants and 
animats. 

Combat: Atomies attack as 3rd-level fighters. About 20% of atomies car¬ 
ry tiny crossbows and spears. Atomic crossbows have a 3-foot range and 
inflict Id3 points of damage. Atomie spears cause id4 points of damage, 
The remaining atomics are armed with either spears (40% I or sprite 
swords (40 %}. Atomies have the following magical abilities, usable once 
per round at Sth-level ability; Wink, riroisrbiJify, pass plant, speak with 
animals and summon inserts* 

Atomie* are surprised only on a 1: opponents suffer a penalty to 
surprise rolls. Upon hearing an intruder, atomies hide and try to make the 
intruder go away using false lights, clattering voices, and pesky, sum¬ 
moned insects. Repeat intruders are warned with crossbow' bolts. If com¬ 
bat is inevitable, or the intruders are ores, the atomies regroup and 
attack. Atomies with spears fly in and dive on surprised opponents (usu¬ 
ally aiming at their posteriors). Diving attacks inflict double damage 
(244k 

Habitat Society: Atomies live in the upper branches of old hardwood 
trees (usually oaks), one family per tree. Each family hollows out a series 
of tiny rooms, decorating with walnut chairs, woven pine needle rugs, 
acorn dishes, and the like. A network of balconies, landings, and rope 
bridges connects the dwellings, forming a village high above the forest 
floor. A typical atomie village house* 3d4 x 10 adults and 4db children. 

Atomies seldom bother with outsiders, even standard sprites (whom 
they view as tedious and too serious), but they will sometimes help a lost 
child, A rescued child is well cared for and entertained before being re¬ 
turned to the outside world. 

The concept of pets is unknown, but atomies often grow mushroom 
■"friends" in their living rooms. 

Atomies have loose leadership, choosing a chieftain based on storytell¬ 
ing and singing ability. 

Ecology; Atomies are herbivores and find the eating habits of their cous¬ 
ins repulsive. They favor nuts above fruit, and prefer honey when they 
can trick bees into giving them some. 

Atomies make a perfect, bite-sized morsels for most creatures, and 
sometimes lall prey to evil animals, such as worgs. 

Atomies view magic as a force connected with life and are fascinated 
by inanimate magical items. Atomies collect magical items and display 
them in their home* or communities.. Nan-magical treasures are consid¬ 
ered clutter and are either thrown away or given to forest creatures who 
value such things. 



A grig has the head, iorso. and arms of a sprite, with the wings, anten¬ 
nae, and legs of a cricket. They can leap great distances. Grigs have light 
blue skin, forest green hair, and brown hairy legs. They usually wear tu¬ 
nics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. Grigs 
speak atomie brownie, pixie, sprite, and Common. They have double 
normal hearing range and IfW-fbofc inf revision The origin of the grigs 
remains a mystery. 

Combat:Fierce (by sprite standards), each grig carries six small darts and 
a sprite sword. Grigs gain a f 2 bonus to attack rolls with darts. Darts 
and swords do normal damage when used by grigs, but only 1 point of 
damage when used by non-grigs. 

Grig* have the following spell-tike abilities usable once per found at 
6th-Jeve! ability: change self, entangle, invisibility, pyrotechnics, trip, 
and ventriloquism. Grigs move silently in woodlands; they are surprised 
only on a 1* while opponents suffer a —6 penalty to surprise rolls. Some 
grigs throw darts, while others leap to attack, and one grig fiddler (grigs 
never go anywhere without a fiddle), plays a song with the same effect as 
Ottos fmestsfib/e dance. All non-sprites within 30 feet of the fiddler must 
make a successful saving throw vs. spell or dance until the grig ceases 
playing* Grigs can play for hours* 

Habitat Society: Grigs roam the forests in small bands They have no per¬ 
manent homes but often sleep in the limbs of treants, or near unicorns 
fwho protect grigs even unto death). 

Grigs are cautious but trusting. They delight in playing pranks on big 
people Common ploys include stealing food, collapsing a tent, and using 
ventriloquism to make objects talk. Once a prank is set, the grigs sit back 
and watch, laughing at ihe unfortunate person. People who make Fools of 
themselves are apt to be plagued by harmless jokes until they reach the 
fores! edge. At that point, one ol the grigs comes out of hiding and makes 
amends with a gilt, either a harmless bauble such as a ld6* 100 gp gem 
(25%) or a precious jar of really fresh honey (75%) 

Ecology: Grigs live on nuts, berries and honey*

Grigs arc mischievous and lighthearted They have no fear of big people 
and take great joy in playing tricks upon them,

Giant squids are huge varieties of the normal, peaceful, tentacled 
cephalopods (unshelled invertebrates). 

They have ten long tentacles, two of which are always used to 
maintain stability when attacking or defending, and long, pro¬ 
tected heads with two eyes. Their beak-like mouths are located 
where the tentacles meet the lower portion of their bodies. 

Combat: Giant squids prefer to grab their opponents in their 
tentacles and constrict them, while they bring the thrashing vic¬ 
tims into their huge jaws. As many as eight tentacles can attack 
one opponent , but only one at a time can constrict a man-sized 
opponent (the rest are free to attack anything else within reach). 
The rubbery tentacles are so strong they cannot be broken by 
force and must be severed. A giant squids tentacles hit for ld6 
points of damage and constrict for 2dt points of damage every 
round after the initial strike. The beak of a giant squid inflicts 5d4 
points of damage. 

Any character vyho is constricted may have one arm {01-25% 
left, or 26-50% rightL no arms (51-75%), or both arms (76- 
100%) pinned, A constricted character cannot cast any spells, 
but he can grab a weapon and attack the tentacle (if only one arm 
is free, he attacks with a -3 penalty to the attack roll; if both arms 
are free, the penalty is - 1 ). A giant squids tentacle requires 12 
points of damage from sharp or edged weapons to sever (these hit 
points are in addition to the hit points from Hit Dice), 

If a giant squid has four or more tentacles severed, the monster 
is 80% likely to squirt out a cloud of jet-black ink 60 feet high by 
60 feet wide and 80 feet long. The squid then jets away and re¬ 
treats to its lair. The ink completely obscures the vision of all 
within the cloud. 

A giant squid can drag ships of small size to the bottom and 
can halt the movement of larger ones in one turn of dragging, 
After six or more tentacles have squeezed the hull of the ship for 
three consecutive rounds, the vessel suffers damage as if it had 
been rammed and it begins to take on water and sink. 

Kraken 

A kraken is a rare form of gargantuan squid. It is one of the most 
deadly monsters in existence. 

Combat: Krakens attack as huge varieties of giant squid. Two of 
their tentacles are barbed and cause 3d6 points of damage when they 
hit. They then try to drag prey toward their gaping maws for a bite 



of 7d4 points of damage, The other six free tentacles inflict 2d6 
points of damage when they hit and constrict for 3 d 6 points each 
round thereafter. A kraken's tentacle must suffer 18 points of dam¬ 
age from shajp or edged weapons to be severed (these hit points are 
in addition to those the kraken gets from its Hit Dice). 

If three of more of its tentacles have been severed, the monster 
is 80% likely to retreat , leaving behind a cloud of ink to discour¬ 
age pursuit. The kraken is 50% likely to retreat to its den if four 
or more of its tentacles have victims. It leaves behind an ink 
cloud in this case also. The ink cloud of a kraken is 80 feet high 
by 80 feet wide by 120 feet long and is poisonous (it dissipates in 
2-5 rounds). Those within the cloud receive 2d4 points of damage 
every round they remain. Krakens jet away to their lairs at a 
movement rate 21 . 

Krakens can drag ships oF 60 feet long down in the same way as 
normal giant squids attack. They have the innate power to cause 
airy water in a sphere 120 yards across or in a hemisphere 240 yards 
across (they can do this continuously ). They can employ the follow¬ 
ing spell-like powers, one at a time, at will: faerie fire for up to eight 
hours, control temperature in a 40-yard radius continuously control 
winds once per day weather summoning once per day and artimal 
summoning HI (fish only) three times per day (note that this spell 
does not grant control of the fish once summoned). 

Krakens are not affected by the conch horns of tritons. 

Habitat Society; Krakens have Intelligences of genius or higher 
and often control entire regions of the underwater world. Their 
lairs lie thousands of feet below the surface and they maintain 
huge complexes of caverns where they keep and breed human 
slaves to serve and feed them. 

Ecology; Krakens can breathe either air or water and are ag¬ 
gressive hunters. Many tropical islands have been completely 
stripped of all inhabitants (animal and human) by krakens. 

It is said that krakens retreated to the depths w T hen the forces of 
good thwarted their attempt to rule the seas, but it is also said 
that in the future krakens will rise again.

Stirges are bird-like creatures that drink the blood of their vic¬ 
tims for sustenance. They have four small, pincer-Uke legs that 
they use to clamp onto the necks of their victims. They are rusty- 
red to reddish brown in colon and their eyes and feet are yellow¬ 
ish* The dangling proboscises of stirges are pink at the tip, fading 
to gray at the base (near their heads). 

Combat: Due to an instinctive ability to find and attack weak 
points, stirges attack as 4-Hit Die creatures, rather than 1 + 1. 
Their long proboscis inflicts 1-3 points of damage when it hits, 
and drains ld4 points of blood every round thereafter. When a 
stirge drains a total of 12 points of blood from a victim, it be¬ 
comes bloated and flies off to digest its protein-rich meal. 

Stirges must be killed to be removed, due to their strong grip. 
If an attack against an attached stirge misses, make another at¬ 
tack roll against the victim's Armor Class to see if the attack hits 
the victim instead. Caution is advisable when attempting to re¬ 
move an attached stirge. 

Habitat,Society: Stirges form nest-like colonies in attics, 
dungeons, and copses of trees* Although they resemble birds, 
they hang upside down when sleeping, indicating that stirges 
may be closely related to vampire bats, 

Stirges can breed in captivity, but a constant supply of blood is 
needed. Stirges mostly kill lowdevel humans, animals and chil¬ 
dren, so the arrival of these predators in any civilized territory is 
always a cause for alarm. Fortunately even a low-levd group of 
adventurers or town militia is usually capable of ending the men¬ 
ace with little or no loss of life. 

Ecology: Stirges have an acute sense of smell, can see m the dark, 
and can sense heat sources within 200 feet* These senses keep 
stirges informed when living creatures enter their habitat. Crea¬ 
tures with a natural AC of 3 or better are usually immune to a 
stirge's blood draining attack, since their hides are too thick to 
penetrate. As a consequence, huge nests of stirges live symbioti- 
cally with some evil dragons. Characters who protect their entire 
bodies with special leather or better armor (this special armor 
costs two to three times more than normal armor) can safely ap¬ 



proach a stirge, Even the slightest gap in the protection is seen 
and smelled by the creature, and a successful attack roll means 
the creature has broken through the weakness and locked on. 

After a stirge has gorged itself by draining blood, it sleeps for 
one day, plus one day for every 2 points of blood it drank (the 
maximum sleep period is after drinking 12 points of blood— 
seven days). During this period of rest, silent attackers can im¬ 
pose a —2 penalty to the stirges' surprise roll* as the beasts wake 
slowly and remain drowsy for a few moments. They are most 
vulnerable at this time. While certain species of stirges prefer to 
dine on human blood, most are content with any large mammal, 
like cows, moose, and deer. Experienced druids and rangers usu¬ 
ally recognize the traces of a stirge colony by the occurrences of 
mysteriously drained and dead animals in the vicinity* 

A stirge colony's territory extends for only a mile in diameter, 
so stirges move around a lot after they've drained a region of the 
available blood. Often, the presence of stirges is only discovered 
long after the colony has departed, making it very difficult to 
track them, 

Jungle Stirges 

There are rumored to be exceptionally large varieties of stirges 
deep in the densest tropical jungles. Though they are only 2+2 
Hit Die creatures, they attack as 8 Hit Die monsters* Purportedly, 
they have a paralyzing poison in the tips of their sharp snouts 
that is highly prized by local tribesmen. Jungle stirges have been 
known to mingle with giant vampire bats. None of these larger 
versions have ever been captured or examined by sages, so noth¬ 
ing else is known about their strengths or weaknesses. What little 
of them is known came from the cannibals and head hunters of 
the jungle regions*

Su-monsters look like big gray monkeys, 4 to 5 feet talk They 
have large bones and muscular limbs, but they always appear a 
bit underfed, because their ribs and vertebrae show prominently. 
Their long, prehensile tails can easily support their weight. Their 
hands and feet are virtually alike, each having three long, thick 
fingers and an opposable thumb, all equipped with claws. Like 
the tail, their hands and feet are very strong, allowing them to 
hang by one limb for several hours. Short, dirty gray fur covers 
most of their body. Their face and tail are black, while their paws 
are always bloody red (making them look like they just finished 
killing something, which is the case more often than not). They 
frequently grin, but this is usually a sharp-toothed threat rather 
than a gesture of friendliness. 

Com bah Su-monsters attack with all four legs when possible, 
raking their extremely sharp nails across their victim. They can 
also deliver a powerful bite with their canine-like mouth, These 
creatures like to hunt in small packs (ld !2 members). Their fa¬ 
vorite hunting grounds are well-traveled trails through the 
jungle/forest. They search for a sturdy branch overhanging a 
trail, and perch in the trees, waiting patiently. When a victim 
passes beneath them, they an swing down, using their tails as an¬ 
chors, This way they can attack with all four claws plus the bite. 
Victims of this kind of ambush suffer a =*4 penalty to their sur¬ 
prise rolls. 

What really makes these beasts ferocious is their tribal protec¬ 
tiveness. Half the time (50% chancel the entire family takes part 
in the hunt; male, female, and two young. If the young are at¬ 
tacked or threatened, the females fight as if under a haste spell 
(Le., double movement and number of attacks). Likewise, if the 
they females are attacked, the males appear to fight with haste. A 
surge of adrenaline accounts for this ferocity. Females can main¬ 
tain the effect for up to 6 turns (an hour), and males can maintain 
it for up to 4 turns, Psionically these creatures can be deadly. 
They know three attack modes. They are also impervious to tele¬ 
pathic attacks. When su-monsters are using enhancement, they 
can attack both psionically and physically if they choose (instead 
of a double attack rate).

Su-monsters always know the following powers, and there is a 
10 % chance that they will have one more science and two more 
devotions in the psychometabolk discipline.

Habitat Society A su-monster family is composed of two parents 
(adult male and female) and two young. When two or more fami¬ 
lies live together, they form a clan, Su-monsters are very territo¬ 
rial and have a particular hatred for the psionically empowered. 

According to legend, su-monsters were created by a powerful 
evil cleric or mage, who wished to guard his forest from intruders 
(especially psionic ones), The creatures do make a formidable at¬ 
tack force, which tends to support this theory, According to 
some sages the creatures are magical hybrid of humanoids and 
apes. In any event, many evil wizards and priests employ su- 
monsters as forest guards today. 

Ecology: Su-monsters keep their valuables well hidden in the 
high boles of the trees in their territory. They have no food value, 
since their meat is mildly poisonous. Characters who eat su- 
monster meat must save vs. poison or become ill, and no natural 
healing is possible for 1 week.

Swanmays* are human females who can assume swan form. In human 
form, swanmays are indistinguishable from other people. They nor¬ 
mally wear light armor and carry rangers" gear, as well as a sword, 
dagger, bow, and arrows. These items are unaffected by a swanmay'$ 
shapeshiHingr so they must be hidden. Swanmays may be recognized 
by a feather token, feathered garment, or signet ring. Such items are 
transformed into part of the swans plumage or worn on a leg. 

Combat: In human form, the swanmay functions as a ranger. To de¬ 
termine the level and Hii Dice of a swanmay, 2db are rolled. She at¬ 
tacks with whatever weapons she possesses. 

In swan form, a swanmay is harmed only by +1 or better weap¬ 
ons. She attacks with buffeting wings, a flying leap, and a bite, 

HabilabSoeiety: Swanmays arc members of a special sorority of ly- 
canthrope rangers. Unlike other lycanlhropes, their shapeshifting 
ability is gained voluntarily from a special token: a feather token, a 
feather garment. or a signet ring. Such items reveal their magical au¬ 
ras when exposed to a detect magic spell Without the item, she is 
forced to remain in her current form. Tokens only function for swan- 
mays. 

Swanmays are extremely secretive about their sorority, Qnly hu¬ 
man women are admitted: the other requirements are unknown. It is 
suspected that women are invited to join when they unknowingly 
perform a great service for another swanmay If a PC Is invited to 
join, it is 50% likely that she will retire from casual adventuring to 
devote herself full time to her new responsibilities. 

Swanmays art guided by their swan personalities, They dislike 
noisy, brash creatures, ferocious beasts, and anything of an evil 
alignment They are friendly with forest folk, such as sylvan elves 
and dryads. They tend to avoid normal humanoids. Only nature 
priests are known to regularly associate with swanmays; such alli¬ 
ances are generally initiated by swanmays when they need help 
against a common evil. 

Swanmays build communal lodgings near bodies of water, deep in 
the forest Such lodgings are lightly fortified against land attack. 
They usually contain two means of escape — a secret tunnel to the 
lake and a ceiling hatch, Swanmays in swan form can use either 
route Swanmay lodgings may be recognized by the number of wa¬ 
terfowl living nearby- The remains of poachers may also be left here 
as a warning to others. 



Ecology; Swanmays are independent protectors of the forests and 
wildlife. They actively oppose evil races or monsters that might 
otherwise decimate wildlife and the countryside. They protect swans 
more out of sympathy for their similarity than out of any kinship. 

Bird Maidens 

In the mountains and cool valleys of the lands of Zakhara lives a race 
of bird maidens, related to the swanmays. Just like their sisters, they 
depend on a token to change forms: a colorful shawl or veil ol feath¬ 
ers, They can assume many bird shapes, including falcons, swallows, 
parrots, and even fat 8th level) giant eagles. 

Though they have no sorority bird maidens are loosely united by 
their faith. All bird maidens are kahina, idol priestesses who believe in 
the divinity of all things. They live as wandering teachers, protecting the 
land from those who despoil it. They get along best with those who re¬ 
spect the land: desert riders, mystics, and fisherfolk. In the fertile river 
valleys, they preach the faith and maintain the fertility of the land and 
livestock. Some tribesmen believe bird maidens are hama t spirits of the 
departed, who return to help the living. Bird maidens deny this and may 
cut themselves to prove that they are flesh and blood 

Bird maidens 1 Hit Dice are equal to their priestly level from 2-8. 
They have major access to the All Animal. Divination, Elemental 
Healing, Plant and Weather spheres and minor access to the Crea¬ 
tion. Protection, and Sun spheres. They carry spears, darts, and 
slings, but may not wear armor or shields (even magical) heavier 
than hide. If they do, they cannot use spells. Bird maidens cannot 
turn undead. 

In bird form, bird maidens can peck and claw, but most don’t fight as 
birds. Only a bird maiden's shawl or veil changes with her when she 
shifts form. All other equipment is unchanged and must be hidden or 
cared for by others until the bird maiden again changes her form. 

Bird maidens are sometimes forced to many men who steal their 
shawls: if they ever recover them, they leave their husbands, killing their 
sons and taking the daughters with them to become bird maidens. If the 
feathered garment is destroyed, the bird maiden dies as well 

Rumors tell of a great wooden fortress among the clouds of the 
high hills, called the Crown of All Feathers, where young bird maid¬ 
ens are taught the rituals and duties of kahinas by the aaracockra.

Tabaxi have spotted coats ranging in color from light yellow to 
brownish red. These graceful feline humanoids are tall and slender, 
with retractable claws, and eyes of green or yellow. 

Some tabaxi have solid spots and are also called leopard men; they 
pronounce their name ta-BAX-ee. Tabaxi in other regions have rose¬ 
ate spots, are called jaguar men, and pronounce their race's name 
tah-BAHSH-w. 

Combat; Tabaxi are great hunters, combining quick, stealthy move¬ 
ments with natural camouflage to surprise prey. Enemies suffer a - 2 
penalty to surprise rolls, Tabaxi are clever and organized, often driv¬ 
ing prey into an ambush (though some play with prey before killing 
it}* Tabaxi climb and swim, and can use those abilities in combat, 
Because of their cleverness and acute sense of smell, tabaxis are al¬ 
most impassible to trap. 

Tabaxi often use weapons of wood, bone, and stone, including bo- 
las, slings, obsidian studded dubs (treat as battle axes), and faveJms 
with atlatl. They are as likely to use claws and teeth as any other 
weapon. If both forepaws hit, a tabaxi rakes with its rear daws* A 
group encountered in the wild will include a Hunt Leader with maxi¬ 
mum hit points, and may 150% chance? indude a 3rd-ievel priest 
with appropriate Hit Dice and spells, 

Ha hi flit Society: Tabaxi dans contain equal numbers of males and fe¬ 
males, and a full dan has Ido+ 1 Hunts of 2d4 tabaxi. The Hunts 
work the area around the clan lair. Some lairs are temporary, but 
most are small villages of ramadas (huts with grass roofs supported 
by tall poles, and no walls). In a lair, 3d4 young with 1 HD each will 
be found. An elder with 4 HD leads the dan, and 50% of the leaders 
are aided by a Sthdevel shaman. A clan has a 10% chance of owing 
allegiance to a tabaxi lord; these darts tend toward evil, warlike 
ways, and their shamans worship evil powers* Shamans ol other 
clans worship powers related to sunlight, rain, or animals. 

Tabaxi are reclusive and avoid other intelligent beings, even other 
tabaxi dans They do not engage in trade, which they consider de¬ 



meaning, but some few have agents who trade for them. Tabaxi 
speak their own ancient language* Legends tell of a great tabaxi civili¬ 
zation that was supplanted by other races, 

Ecology: Tabaxi have few natural enemies. For food, they prefer the 
boar-like peccaries and huge rodents called eapybaras; only a very 
degenerate dan attacks members of another intelligent species for 
Food. Tabaxi are sometimes hunted for their pelts, worth up to 250 gp 
each. Their skins and daws are also useful in some types of natural

A tabaxi lord appears as a huge jaguar or leopard, depending on 
where it is found. They are intelligent, malicious, and cunning. They 
speak tabaxi and languages commonly used by nearby societies. The 
antithesis of couatls, tabaxi lords hate them (the feeling is mutual) 
and attack couati on sight. 

Tabaxi lords use trickery, ambush, allies, and spells to weaken foes 
before dosing for combat* Some 55% are 7th-level wizards, while 
40% are 7th-it?vel priests of a dark power known as Zaltec, Five per¬ 
cent are both wizard and priest. Wizard spells are chosen from the 
schools of illusion, enchantment/charm, or necromancy; spells from 
the schools of alteration and invocation/evocation are never used. In 
addition to spells that require only verbal components, they can use 
the following powers at will: defect gpod/evit, detect invisibility, 
bind t and hypnotism. The bravest and cruelest tabaxi lords can use 
dimension door three times per day. 

Tabaxi lords are closely related to tabaxi, perhaps a cursed version. 
All tabaxi lords are male and must lake a tabaxi mate to produce 
offspring (always a male tabaxi lord). Although usually solitary, a 
tabaxi lord sometimes takes leadership of a rabaxt dan for the pur¬ 
pose of mating and insuring offspring. Some choose to stay with the 
clan even after the offspring is bom and sent off to make Its way in 
the jungle*

The tako are a race of intelligent octopi who can move onto land 
and use weapons and other tools. 

Tako have no bones; their plump bodies are protected by 
tough mantles of leathery skin. They have eight supple tentacles,, 
similar to those of octopi, lined with circular muscles that act as 
suction cups. They have a single golden eye centered in their 
heads, and sharp, protruding jaws that resemble the bill of a par¬ 
rot. Although tako can change color with ease, a mature male's 
normal color is light green, while a mature females is orange-red. 
Young tako appear in a variety of colors, including black, brown, 
white, blue r and golden, 

Tako have their own language based on tentacle movements 
and skin-color changes. Characters with an Intelligence of at 
least 17 {or with the reading/writing proficiency) have a 25% 
chance ot understanding the tako's language. 

Combat: Though normally docile, tako attack any creature who 
invades their territory. In addition, they have a strong sense of 
honor, and will avenge attacks and ally with members of other 
races who assist them. They are crafty opponents. Tako can 
change their color and pattern to match any natural terrain in a 
single round. This camouflage makes them 90% undetectable, 
and modifies the surprise rolls of opponents by -3. 

Most tako war parties are exclusively male. The tako attack 
with their beaks. They also can anchor themselves with a single 
tentacle, leaving the remaining seven tentacles free to make at¬ 
tacks. Usually the tako carry seven weapons—one spear or hand 
axe in each free tentacle, 

Tako can make constriction attacks similar to octopi. Any vic¬ 
tim under 7 feet tall for 7 feet long) can be grappled by one tenta¬ 
cle at a time. Male tako have a 10% chance of pinning both of the 
victims arms with a single strike; females have a 15% chance. 
The chance ot pinning only one upper limb is the same. If both 



limbs are pinned, the victim has no attack. If only one limb is 
pinned, the victim attacks with a *3 penalty to his attack roll. If 
no limbs are pinned, the victim attacks with a —1 penalty. 

Tako tentacles grip with a Strength of 1S/QG; a victim with a 
Strength equal to or greater than 18/OG can grasp the tentacle and 
loosen it, negating the constriction. To break completely free, a 
tentacle must be severed; males have 4 hit points per tentacle, 
females have 6 hit points per tentacle. Unless loosened or sev¬ 
ered, tentacle constriction automatically inflicts 1-4 hit points of 
damage per round from males, or 2-8 (2d4) points from females, 

Young tako cannot perform constriction attacks. Their AC is 
7, and they have 1 HD. Their THACO is 20. They inflict 0-1 hp of 
damage per tentacle attack, and 1*3 hp with their beak, Other¬ 
wise, they're just small, feisty versions of their parents, with an 
MR of 1 (5w3) and XP value of 35. 

Habitat-Society: A tako tribe comprises 3-12 (3d4) males, half as 
many young, and 1-2 females. Females make all decisions for the 
tribe, while the males act as defenders and hunters, The creatures 
establish their lairs in coastal underwater caves, making occa¬ 
sional raids on land for food, weapons, and treasure items. In 
some areas, tako coexist with humans, cooperating to attack sea 
monsters and to help fishermen, but such cases are extremely 
rare. 

Ecology: Tako cat oysters, crabs, lobsters, and other shell fish, 
which they crack open with their powerful jaws. They can eject 
small clouds of rich blue ink, but the clouds are too limited to 
serve as a defense. Humans greatly prize the ink, however, and 
use it to create calligraphy.

TanarVi are, in the broadest terms, chaos and evil defined. The 
less intelligent often attack without question and fight until slain. 
True and greater tanar'ri often roam the Astral and Ethereal 
Planes—their attention is attracted by those in an ethereal state.

T greater tanar ri suffer half damage from silver weapons, 


All tanarri with average or above average intelligence have a 
form ok telepathy that enables them to communicate with any 
intelligent life form, regardless of any language barriers. 

Frequently, the Abyss-forged, magical weapons of the tanar ri 
dissolve upon the death of the creature. When one doesn’t, it is 
likely that the weapon in question originated somewhere else. 

Habitat/Sodety: There are five dasstficalions of tanar ri, listed in 
ascending order of power, and with species, below: 

Least: dretch, manes, rutterkin 

Lessee alu-fiend, bar-lgura, cambion, succubus 

Greater: babau, chasme, nabassu 

True: balor, glabrezu, hezrou, marilith, nalfeshnec, vrock 
Guardian: molvdeus 

Balor True Tanar'ri): The greatest and most terrible of the true 
tanarVi , the balors are the undisputed terrors of the Abyss. They 
are the very motivation behind the tanarri involvement in the 
Blood War. In every sense of the word, balors are the quintessen¬ 
tial tanar ri. They derive great pleasure from the suffering of oth¬ 
ers and go out of their way to torment lesser beings and cause 
them pain. 



Balors are repulsive and loathsome to behold. They are tower¬ 
ing humanoids with deep, dark red skin. They have huge wings 
lhai propel them with unnatural speed and agility, They have 
long, wicked claws and grotesque fangs that drip with venom. 
Balors are commonly surrounded by searing flames. 

Combat: Balors attack with their great fists for 2-12 points of 
damage. Anyone struck by a baloris fists must roll a saving 
throw vs. spells with a ~t penalty or flee in terror for 1-6 turns 

Balors much prefer weapons to fists in combat. Each carries a 
great sword that looks like a bolt of lightning. In the hands of a 
balor these swords are vorpal and can detect evil/good in a 30 
foot radius. Any creature that picks up a balors sword, regard¬ 
less ot whether its skin acLuallv touches it, immediately suffers 
10-60 points of damage and must roll a saving throw vs. spells, or 
die immediately. 

Balors also use a great whip with many tails. These whips will 
inflict but 1-4 points of damage per hit. However, they magically 
wrap the victim, allowing the balor to draw the victim into his 
ever-present bodily flames. Once dragged into the flames, the 
victim suffers 4-24 points of damage per round. Escaping the 
whip requires a successful one-half strength check. When the 
whip holds a victim, it cannot be used in other attacks. 

Balors may use one of the following additional magical powers 
at the 20 th level of spell use per round at will: detect invisibility 
(always active), defect magic (always active}, dispel magic, fear 
pyrotechnics, read magic suggestion, symbol (any type) teleki¬ 
nesis, and tongues. 

They may also gate 1-8 least, 1-6 lesser, 1-4 greater, or 1 true 
tanar’ri to thdr location. The gate is always successful but may 
only be used once per hour. 

Balors are completely immune to gas. If a balor is slain in the 
Abyss, it explodes in a blinding flash of light, inflicting 50 points 
of damage to everything in a 300-foot radius around the creature 
(saving throw vs. spell for half damage). 


317 










Tanar’ri 


Habitat/Society: Balors exist for one purpose only: to wage the 
Blood War They are driven by the strongest primal desire to 
fight and will command whole legions of beings into battle, 

Balors also recognize a subtle but important aspect of the War: 
the prime material plane. They will often make pacts with mor¬ 
tals to perform services for the purpose of gaining power in the 
prime material plane, Balors know that the more followers or al¬ 
lies they can gain in the prime material, the more power they will 
have there. 

There are at least 24 balors known to exist. The creatures do 
not inhabit any particular area of the Abyss, but wander about 
forming armies for battle with the baatezu (q.v J, 

Ecology: There is nothing more important in the Abyss than the 
Blood War. The balor r in a sense, are the Blood War from a 
tanarVi perspective, the ecology of the Abyss, driving the crea¬ 
tion of new beings and mandating their survival. 

Marilith iTrue Tanaririi: Bold and cunning, marilith are the gen¬ 
erals and tacticians for the Blood War. Where the balors are the 
influence and energy behind the war effort, the marilith are the 
brains and tactics. 

Terrible to behold, these creatures have the bodies of giant 
snakes, with huge, green, scaly coils. From the waist up, they are 
beautiful, comely females. Besides her obvious snake body the 
feature that reveals the true nature of this tanar Vi is her six arms. 
They are commonly adorned with precious jewelry and highly 
decorated weapons—marilith most often carry a different weap¬ 
on in each of their six hands. 

Combat: Although marilith are strategists and tacticians, they 
love to join combat and do so whenever the opportunity presents 
itself. They can attack with each of their six arms and constrict a 
victim with their snaky tails as well, 

Marilith always carry a different weapon in each hand, favor¬ 
ing exotic swords and axes. The DM should assign specific weap¬ 
ons: 90% of them should be enchanted versions of the common 
variety, and 15% of those should be a special weapon, Marilith 
favor their weapons highly If one should ever be lost or stolen, 
marilith go to great lengths to see that the weapon is recovered, 

A marilith can also constrict with her deadly tail. If the tail hits 
in combat, it wraps around a victim, automatically inflicting 4- 
24 points of crushing damage each round. Additionally due to 
the constriction of air, the victim must roll a successful Constitu¬ 
tion check every round or fall unconscious. No opponent with 
less than a IS Strength score can even hope to break free of the 
mariiitb's toils. There is a 10% chance per round, per point of 
Strength over 14, that the victim can escape. Marilith have the 
following additional magical powers that they can use once per 
round, one at a time, at will; animate dead, cause serious 
wounds, cloudkilh comprehend languages, curse, detect evil de¬ 
tect magic, detect invisibility, polymorph self (7 times per day), 
project image pyrotechnics , and telekinesis. 

They may also attempt to gate in 2-20 least tanar ri, l-o lesser 
tanariri, 1-4 greater tanar ri. or 1 true tanar ri once per hour with 
a 35% chance of success. 



Weapons of 4 1 or less magical enchantment cannot harm a 
marilith. These creatures are never surprised. They cannot be 
fooled by illusions and are immune to mind-affecting spells. 

Habitat Society: As noted, marilith are the strategists of the 
Blood War. They are in charge of devising ail tactics to be used 
during the battles and coordinate the activities of all true tanar ri 
(save the mighty balors, of course}* Due to the chaotic nature of 
the tanar ri, it is not really possible to coordinate their activities, 
but the marilith are charged with it, nonetheless. 

These stunningly powerful creatures have a hatred for the gla- 
brezu. They feel that the subtle warfare of the glabrezu is a chil¬ 
drens game and inferior to proper warfare. A marilith will 
attempt to discredit the workings of the glabrezu any chance it 
gets. They would completely destroy the subtle beasts, but the all 
powerful balors favor the giabrezus' tactics and would have them 
continue their ways. 

Ecology: Marilith are true tanar ri, which makes them a part of 
the driving force behind the Blood War. Moreover, they are the 
coordinators and generals of the war effort. Marilith feel that 
they are the true force behind the war. Secretly, they feel that the 
balors have their place only because of their great power, but are 
not absolutely necessary. They may be right in their belief, but 
the power of the balors remains unchallenged.

Combat: The tarrasque is a killing machine and when active 
(see below) eats everything for miles around, including all ani¬ 
mals and vegetation. Normal attacks are with its two forelimb 
daws (ld!2 points of damage each), a sweeping tail lash (2dl2 
points of damage), a savage bite (5d10 points of damage plus acts 
as a sword ofsharpness, severing a limb on a natural attack roll 
of 18 or better) and two thrusting hom attacks (ldlQ points of 
damage each), 

Once every turn, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can 
rush forward at a movement rate of 15, making all hom attacks 
cause double damage and trampling anything underfoot for 4dI0 
points of crushing damage. 

The mere sight of the tarrasque causes creatures with less than 
3 levels or Hit Dice to be paralyzed with Fright (no saving throw) 
until it is out of their vision. Creatures of 3 or more levels or Hit 
Dice flee in panic, although those of 7 or more levels or Hit Dice 
that manage to succeed with a saving throw vs. paralyzation are 
not affected (though they often still decide to run away). 

The tarrasque's carapace is exceptionally tough and highly re¬ 
flective. Bolts and rays such as lightning bolts, cones of cold, and 
even magic missiles are useless against it. The reflection is such 
that 1 in 6 of these attacks actually bounces directly back at lhe 
caster (affecting him normally), while the rest bounce off harm¬ 
lessly to the sides and into the air. 

The tarrasque is also immune to all heat and fire, and it regen¬ 
erates lost hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per round. Only en¬ 
chanted weapons ( + 1 or better) have any hope of harming the 
tarrasque. The Tarrasque is totally immune to ail psionics. 

Habitat/Society: It is fortunate that the tarrasque is active only 
for short periods of time. Typically, the monster comes forth to 
forage for a week or two, ravaging the countryside for miles 
around. The tarrasque then seeks a hidden lair underground and 


lies dormant, sleeping for 5d4 months before coming forth again. 
Once every decade or so, the monster is particularly active, stay¬ 
ing awake for several months. Thereafter its period of dormancy 
is 4d4 years unless disturbed. The ratio of active to dormant 
states seems to be about I;3Q. 

Ecology: Slaying of the tarrasque is said to be possible only ii 
the monster xs reduced io -30 or fewer hit points and a wish is 
then used. Otherwise, even the slightest piece of the Larrasque 
cart regenerate and restore the monster completely. Legend says 
that a great treasure can be extracted iroirt the tarrasque s cara¬ 
pace. The upper portion, treated with add and then heated in a 
furnace, is thought to yield gems (lOdlO diamonds of 1,000 gp 
base value each). The underbelly material, mixed with the crea¬ 
ture's blood and adamantite, is said to produce a metal that can 
be forged by master dwarven blacksmiths into ld4 shields of +5 
enchantment. It Lakes two years to manufacture each shield, and 
the dwarves aren't likely to do it for free. 

It is hoped that the tarrasque is a solitary creation, some hid¬ 
eous abomination unleashed by the dark arts or by elder 
forgotten gods to punish all of nature. The elemental nature of 
the tarrasque leads the few living tarrasque experts to speculate 
that the elemental princes of evil have something to do with its 
existence. In any case, the location of the tarrasque remains a 
mystery, as it rarely leaves witnesses in its w r ake, and nature 
quickly grows over all remnants of its presence. It is rumored 
that the tarrasque is responsible for the extinction of one ancient 
civilization, for the records of their last days spoke of a "great 
reptilian punisher sent by the gods to end the world." 

Note: Creatures with a minus THAC0 can only be hit on a 1.

Tasloi are long-legged, flat-headed humanoids. They walk in a 
crouching posture, touching their knuckles to the ground from 
time to time. Their skins are a lustrous green and are thinly cov- 
ered with coarse black hair. Their eyes are similar to a cat s and 
are gold in color. 

Often they can be heard at night, speaking in their high, whis- 
pery voices. Tasloi speak their own tongue and can also speak the 
languages of monkeys and apes. About 5% of their kind have 
learned a pidgin common that they use when trading. 

Combat: Tasloi like to hide in tree tops and drop down on the 
weak and unwary. They are quick and nimble in Lhe trees, but 
slow and clumsy on the ground. When they are in jungle, their 
stealthy movements impose a -4 penalty to opponents' surprise 
roils. They also hide in shadows, like a thief, with 75% effective¬ 
ness, Their infra vision enables them to see up to 90 feet in dark¬ 
ness, but they hate daylight and suffer a -1 penalty to their attack 
roll when fighting in broad daylight. 

Tasloi carry the following weapons: small shield (AC 5) and 
javelin—20 %. club and javelin—40% r short sword and small 
shield iAC 5)—10% f javelin and net—15%, short sword and 
net—10% or javelin and lasso— 5%. Tasloi without shields are 
AC 6. They customarily carry all javelins and shields on their 
backs when they travel through the trees. 

Tasloi eat anything, but they enjoy all kinds of flesh, especially 
humans and elves. They normally attack from above, trying to 
capture if possible. If they gain surprise, they use their 10-foot- 
djameter nets to trap their prey (the nets totally entangle those of 
less than 15 Strength: those of 15 or greater Strength need a suc¬ 
cessful open doors roll to rip the net and escape). If a party is too 
vigilant or prepared, the tasloi attempt to wear down the group 
through short, sudden attacks followed by retreat. If possible, 
tasloi try to steal the enemy s dead after an attack. 



Habitat/Sodety: The tasloi live in looseiy-struetured bands of 
several families. In every band of 70 or more, there is a chief of 5 
Hit Dice, There is a 30% chance that any band has a shaman. 
Tasloi shamans may advance up to 5th level. 

When found in their lair, in addition to the males, there are 
females and young equal to 70% and 50% of the number of 
males, respectively. Females fight as males, but the young do not 
light at all. The lair consists of a series of ld6 large trees with 4d6 
platforms 50-100 feet above the ground. All the trees are connect¬ 
ed by vines and ropes. There is a 60% chance that the tasloi have 
ld6 trained giant spiders and a 20% chance that they have 2d4 
trained giant wasps, Tasloi are able to ride these wasps for great 
distances, and the spiders aid in the construction, protection, and 
overall maintenance of the tree-village. 

Ecology: It is not known where and how tasloi originated. It is 
likely they have been around for many millennia, interbreeding 
in deep isolated jungles. Their primitive lifestyle has probably ex¬ 
isted in much the same fashion for thousands upon thousands of 
years. 

While certainly among the least fearsome of all jungle crea¬ 
tures, tasloi are perhaps worth worrying about in numbers, or 
after fleeing encounters with nastier jungle denizens, Tasloi know 
the location of such lairs and often set up obvious escape routes 
for any creature that foolishly finds itself confronting the beast. 
The tasloi then lay their traps along the escape path and wait for 
the weakened, unsuspecting creatures to run through blindly. 
This strategy is highly successful, apparently, as the tasloi boast 
many more trophies than their small size and limited prowess 
might otherwise indicate.

Thought eaters are natives of the Border Ethereal, and they only 
survive in ethereal form. They appear as sickly gray skeletal 
bodies with oversized platypus heads. They have webbed skele¬ 
tal paws, suited to swimming through the ether. 

A thought eater has only one desire—to avoid death. For some 
reason, they die almost instantly on the Prime materia) plane, 
Fortunately for them, they have several psionic powers which 
help to prevent this. 

Combat: Thought eaters are unique. They have no combat abili¬ 
ties except their innate psionic talents, even on the Border Ethers 
al, so they can be easily slain if encountered there. 

Thought eaters are far from harmless, however. Although they 
cannot survive outside the Border Ethereal, their psionic powers 
extend into the Prime material plane. This is one of the few 
known examples of transplanar extension. 

The thought eaters' psionic sense is always operating. Because 
of their unique abilities, they can sense psionic activity in the 
Prime material plane, as well as the Border Ethereal. When they 
detect psionic activity of any kind, they will shift to the location 
of the emanations. 

Their only "attack'' is their innate ability to absorb psionic en¬ 
ergy. They can absorb psionic energy within 60 feet of a true 
psionidst or psionic creature, or within 10 feet of a wild talent. 
Thought eaters drain 10 psionic points per round and they will 
also absorb any spell cast in the area as well as memorized spells 
&lt;5 points per spell level!. Finally, they can feed upon Intelligence, 
with each point converted to 10 PSPs that they absorb. They will 
feed until all victims die or escape, or until they themselves are 
sated. This occurs when they reach a number of points equal to 
their PSPs. 

Although they feed on brain power, thought eaters are essen¬ 
tially stupid. Because they lack intelligence, they are immune to 
ail telepathic attacks and controls (psionic or otherwise). Their 
preferences and the order in which they feed are always the same: 
1) psionic points being expended (causes power to fail); 2) magi¬ 
cal energy being expended (causes spell to fail; 3) PSPs; 4! memo¬ 
rized spells, 5) Intelligence. Note that if a thought eater consumes 
all of someone s Intelligence, the victim will become a vegetable 
(effectively dead). The Intelligence loss is permanent, unless it is 



relieved by restore or psychic surgery. Spells can be re- 
memorized and drained PSPs can be recovered naturally 

The thought eaters' feeding frenzy has the sole purpose of 
maintaining thought eaters in the ether, Their bodies process 
PSPs the way humanoids process food, at a rate of 3 PSPs/hour. 
If they run out of points, they drop out of the ether into the Prime 
material plane and meet an instant death. 

Note that ethereal beings are invisible to creatures on the 
Prime material plane, it is probable that a thought eater will at* 
tack and feed unnoticed and uncontested until sated, or until its 
victims are out of range. Although it only has a mo% r etnent rate of 
6, this is ethereal movement, allowing passage through walls 
trees, etc. as if they didn't exist. 

Any defense mode except those with a 0 maintenance cost will 
prevent the thought eaters from feeding. This includes spells like 
mind blank t and magical devices that thwart psionic attacks 

Psionics Summary: Thought eaters have ldlQO + lOQ (101*200) 
PSPs. Their score is 18. They boast a natural, innate form of psi¬ 
onic sense (in a metapsionic power), which operates continu¬ 
ously at no cost to PSPs. They also absorb PSPs-see Combat. 

Habitat/Society: Little is known about thought eaters, except 
that they exist solely in the ethereal plane and are very solitary 
beings, Magical research has indicated that they are not malevo¬ 
lent; their attacks are for the sole purpose of staying alive, the 
same as any humanoid hunter. Some sages believe that though 
eaters are the final fate of psionisists, once they die. 

Ecology: Thought eaters carry no treasure. When one dies, it au¬ 
tomatically drops out of the ether and materializes on the Prime 
material plane, Of course, they are usually dismissed as platypi 
that died from starvation.

Thri-kreen are a rate of large, intelligent insects often referred to as “man¬ 
tis warriors' They roam the deserts and savannahs, where they have 
marked-out hunting territories. They have no need of sleep and can re¬ 
main active through the day and night. 

Mature adult thri-kreen are roughly 7 feet tall at the shoulder and 11 
feet long. Ot the six limbs protruding from their midsection, two are used 
For walking; the other four end in four-fingered hands. The tough, sandy- 
yellow exoskeleton is extremely hard. A thri-kreen has two compound 
eyes. usually black with highlighted eyespots, two antennae, and a com¬ 
plicated jaw structure that manipulates food as the thri-kreen chews. The 
antennae help the individual to maneuver through brush and grasslands 
in the darkness (they also reduce any melee combat penalty from dark¬ 
ness or blindness by I: missile combat is not affected), Thri-kreen often 
wear harnesses and even some forms of clothing, but they never wear 
armor. 

The native thri-kreen language is made up of dicks and the grinding of 
its jaw appendages. While it is difficult for other creatures to speak this 
tongue, it is fust as difficult for a thri-kreen to imitate more standard 
speech patterns. Thri-kreen speak their own language, but some under¬ 
stand the Common tongue. 

Thri-kreen seldom live more than 35 years. 



two chatkcha per round, up to 90 yards. A chatkcha causes Id6 + 2 dam¬ 
age when it hits, and returns to the thrower when it misses. 

Venom; This venom is delivered through an older thri-kreens bite. 
Anyone bitten must make a successful saving throw vs, paralyzatfon or 
be paralyzed. Smaller than man-sized creatures are paralyzed for 2dlQ 
rounds,, man-sized for 2dS rounds, large creatures for ld6 rounds, and 
huge and gargantuan creatures for only one round 

Dodge missiles: A mature thri-kreen can dodge missiles fired at it on a 
roll of 9 or better on ld2Q; they cannot dodge magical effects, only physi¬ 
cal missiles. Magical physical missiles (arrows, thrown axes, etc .) modify 
this roll by their magica) bonus. 

Psion res: Some thri-kreen have psion ic wild talents. There is a 50% 
chance that any thri-kreen will have a psionic wild talent, described in the 
Complete Psionics Handbook , 

Magical Items: Thri-kreen can use most magical Hems, though those 
designed for humanoid creatures cannot be worn properly, so will not 
function for a thri-kreen. 

Hahit j[ Society: Thri-kreen organize into hunting packs; there are no 
permanenl thri-kreen communities. Packs range over wide territories 
that they call their own. Small groups consist only of mature adults. 
Groups of more than eight thri-kreen are two-thirds mature adults, and 
one-third other age categories (in about equal numbers). 

Ecology: Thri-kreen are carnivores. They seldom hunt other intelligent 
creatures for food, but will do so in times of need, Mantis warriors have a 
well-known taste for elves, which keeps both races at an uneasy peace at 
best. 


Combat: A thri-kreen's chitinous eKoskeleton gives it AC 5 naturally. Un¬ 
armed. it can attack with four daws and one bite attack per round. If 
using a weapon, the thri-kreen can attack with its weapon and bite. The 
guthka, a pole arm with a blade a! each end, can slash for ld6 hp damage 
against man-sized or smaller targets, or IdKJ hp damage against a larger 
target. The gythka can be thrown as a spear to inflict ld6 +2 hp damage. 
Thri-kreen also learn special combat maneuvers as they grow older, 
learning all by the time they are mature adults. 

Leap: This ability allows a thri-kreen to leap 20 feet straight up or up to 
50 feet forward. They cannot leap backward. 

Chatkcha; This is a crystalline throwing w edge. A thri-kreen can throw 


Related Species 

The tohr-kreen, or mantis nobles, are larger, more cultured versions of 
thri-kreen. Though many of them wander their w r orld to gain knowledge, 
they sometimes build cities as well. They regard thri-kreen as somewhat 
barbaric cousins, though there have been incidences of a tohr-kreen cre¬ 
ating a permanent settlement of thri-kreen. or teaching a pack more civi¬ 
lized ways. 

The xixthii are spacefaring mantis. These creatures are skilled surgeons 
and artificers, who enjoy replacing lost limbs with "more efficient" substi¬ 
tutes.

Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and woman. They, 
quite simply, look like 25’ tall people of great physical strength 
and beauty. They are commonly dressed in traditional Greek 
garb, favoring togas, loincloths, and such. They wear rare and 
valuable jewelry and in other ways make themselves seem beau¬ 
tiful and overpowering. 

In addition to speaking their own language, titans are able to 
speak the six main dialects of giants. All titans are also conver¬ 
sant in the common tongue as well as that commonly spoken by 
forest creatures, as these giants have close ties with nature, 

Combat: The basic attack of titans is their great maul (maul of the 
titans). These monstrous beings are capable of attacking twice in a 
melee round and inflicting 7-42 points of damage per hit, 

Titans may choose to make a single other attack in a round. 
This form of special attack is so destructive and deadly, that a 
titan will use it only if there are no other options left open, The 
form of each titan's attack will be different (some kick, some 
punch, others use a breath attack, lightning, etc.), but the effect 
is the same for each. The special attack inflicts 10-60 points of 
damage per hit and can be used every' other round. These mighty 
attacks have been known to destroy buildings and sink ships. 

Titans can become ethereal twice per day. All titans are able to 
employ both mage or priest spells (dependent on the individual 
titan’—only one, not both) as a 20th-level spell caster. In addi¬ 
tion, all titans have the following spell-like powers, at 20th level 
of spell use, usable once per round, one at a time, at will:

Titans arc not affected by attacks from nonmagical weapons. 

Habitat/Society: Titans are livers of life, creators of fate. These 
benevolent giants are closer to the well springs of life than mere 
mortals and, as such, revel in their gigantic existences. Titans are 
wild and chaotic. They are prone to more pronounced emotions 
that humans and can experience godlike fits of rage. They are, 
however, basically good and benevolent, so they tend not to take 
life. They are very powerful creatures and will fight with ferocity 
when necessary. 

To some, titans seem like gods. With their powers they can 
cause things to happen that, surely, only a god could. They are 
fiery and passionate, displaying emotions with greater purity 
and less reservation than mortal beings. Titans are quick to an¬ 
ger, but quicker still to forgive. In fits of rage they destroy moun¬ 
tains and in moments of passion will create empires. They are in 
all ways godlike and in all ways larger than life. 

And yet is should be noted that titans are not gods. They are 
beings that make their home in Olympus and walk among the 
gods. Yet they are not omnipotent, omniscient rulers of the 
planes. Sometimes their godlike passions and godlike rages make 
them seem like deities* however, and it is common for whole civi¬ 
lizations to mistake them for deities. 


343 







Titan 


In one society, Jeuron, a titan with dominion over knowledge, 
was revered as a god for centuries. Those mortals built their 
whole civilization around him and Jeuron revelled in the wor¬ 
ship. He even walked among them occasionally to see their love 
and admiration. But Odin, of the Norse mythos. discovered his 
deception and punished leuron by shackling him to the bottom of 
the deepest sea for 100 years. 

Titans have a natural affinity for storm giants. Those giants 
are the closest beings the titans have found to peers and they will 
readily befriend them. In any group of titans, there is a 35% 
chance that they will be accompanied by one or more storm gi¬ 
ants. Although titans can sometimes be condescending by na¬ 
ture, they never treat the storm giants as subordinates or 
inferiors. 

On Olympus, titans have developed a culture similar to what 
they found there. They wear similar clothing, eat similar foods, 
play similar music, etc. It is unclear why this has occurred. Per¬ 
haps the titans, m a godlike whim, adopted their favorite mortal 
lifestyle. Such would not be unusual for these great beings. 

Titans primarily dwell in great palaces and mansions in Olym¬ 
pus where they live their lives whimsically. There they will 
dance, sing, study debate and engage in ail other manner of ac¬ 
tivities with titanic proportion. If a titan finds something that in¬ 
terests him, it would not be unusual for him to study it in great 
detail for many weeks, only to leave it when his interest has 
waned. They may also engage in debates or arguments that last 
literally for weeks at a time. These debates might end in a jovial 
laughter and good spirits or in thunder and rage. Such are the 
whims of titans. 

Ecology; Titans are basically identical to humans, except much 
larger. What makes them immortal is not known. Perhaps it is 
their enchanted existence in the halls of Olympus. 

These giants are commonly known to experience the same 
range of emotions as humans do. They develop idiosyncrasies as 
humans do, also. In fact, titan mannerisms emulate those of hu¬ 
mans very closely. Again, it is difficult to tell if the titans are 
whimsically copying humans, or vice versa* 

Titans, being godlike creatures, tend to be very diverse and 
unique. Each individual titan (or sometimes group of titans) have a 
special power is that related to their personality or sphere of influ¬ 
ence, These powers are very different, and usually very strong. 
Some examples of the powers of a titan are explained below: 


Algorn, a titan that has influence over the seas, has the ability to 
create u&gt;af*?r whenever he chooses to. This water can be vast 
as he desires, up to the volume of a medium-sized lake. Al- 
gom can simply cause the water to flow, he can cause it to jet 
out from his hands (washing away everything In its path 
away), or he can even cause the water to be frozen. 

Mane, a titan with dominion over felines, has the ability to 
change into a giant form of any cat. When he transforms, he is 
instantly cured of all wounds, poisons, and diseases. Mane 
may change into a cat and back again five times per day. 
Porphyl is a titan with the power of growth. He may cause any 
immature life to grow to maturity. Thus, he can cause crops to 
grow, he can make a boy grow to manhood, etc. Porphyl is 
very wise and would never abuse his ability, 

Malephus, a titan with influence over law and justice can unerr* 
ingly detect any spoken lie and any bad intention. He is often 
used by many greater powers in trials of justice. Malephus is 
totally honest: he is incapable of lies or deception. 

Syliia. a titan with power over love, can remove any negative 
feelings from any being (except deities and powers). She has 
the ability to remove hatred, unhappiness, depression, etc* 
SyIlia cannot remove the feeling permanently, but for at least 
a day or so. The deities of the upper planes often employ her 
power when trying to stop wars, 

Girzon, a titan with dominion over death, can take the life from 
any living being. It should be noted that Girzon has never 
used this ability unless commanded to by a deity* Girzon"s re¬ 
straint and self-control is revered by other titans. 

Greater Titans: Rumors exist of a race of titans more powerful 
still than common titans. These greater titans are said to be very 
dose to the gods and always accompany one (with some deities 
and powers being attended by more than one greater titan). Per¬ 
haps greater titans were formally common titans who have 
grown so great in power that the gods brought them closer to 
themselves. Such matters are not common knowledge. 

It is very' difficult to provide combat statistics for greater ti¬ 
tans. Like the gods themselves, greater titans are simply not sub¬ 
ject to aggression from nondivine beings. They are never harmed 
by such attacks.

Giant toads are Found in most regions. Although their smaller cous¬ 
ins are beneficial insect eaters, the large toads devour {or at least at¬ 
tempt to devour) any creature which appears edible. 

Their exact appearance varies from species to species, but these 
beasts are all just what their name implies, giant versions of toads. 
Coloration runs the gamut from weak brown to iron red, but their 
skin is always dry, rough to the touch, and warty. 

Combat; All giant toads can jump up to their movement distance. 
This hop will dear any object up to one- third as high as the length ot 
the leap and requires but a single round to accomplish. A jumping 
toad can attack in midair or at the end of the leap. 

When hunting, giant toads remain motionless until likely prey 
walks or slithers within range. The toad then leaps to the attack; the 
victim has a -3 penalty on its surprise roll. 

Habitat Society: Giant toads often make their homes underground, 
where they enjoy both the damp air and the steady supply of food. 
They prefer temperate zones, near water where they can lay their 
eggs, but often survive in surprisingly cool or dry regions. 

Toads are often attracted to settled areas where they prey upon 
livestock (goats, chickens, and even sheepL Cities often have prob¬ 
lems with sewer toads, giant monstrosities which have grown fat on 
vermin, house pets, and, occasionally, civil engineers. 

Ecology: Giant toads keep no treasure, but worthwhile indigesti- 
bles are occasionally found in their droppings. Their skin can be fash¬ 
ioned into suitable leather armor, but its odor will be at least as 
distinctive as its appearance. 

Fire Toad 

These large, red toads are about 4 feet long and covered with rough, 
purple warts. Fire toads shun water, preferring drier surroundings. 
Fire toads are so named because of their ability to exhale small tire- 
balls. These fireballs are their only form of attack; a single fireball 
can travel up to 30 feet and has a blast radius of 5 feel. Damage is 
equal to 2-16 points, half that if a saving throw vs. spell is made. Fire 
toads rarely attack unless threatened, molested, or defending their 
lairs. Fire toads subtract 1 point of damage on all dice for fire-based 
attacks against them, but cold- or water-based attacks inflict an addi¬ 
tional point of damage per die, Throwing liquid—even water—at a 
fire toad will cause it to retreat, though it will immediately breathe 
twice at its assailant in the round of its retreat. 

Ice Toad 

Fully intelligent, ice toads dwell in cold dimes or far beneath the sur¬ 
face of the ground. In addition to its vicious bite, the creature can 


radiate cold in a 10-foot radius from its body Ice toads can generate 
this special attack once every other round. All noncold-using crea¬ 
tures within this sphere of cold suffer 3-18 points of damage. Charac¬ 
ters making a saving throw vs, spell suffer only half damage. Ice 
toads speak their own weird language and actively collect gems and 
jewelry, particularly diamonds. 

Poisonous Toad 

These toads, indistinguishable from common giant toads, secrete a 
weak, hemotoxic poison. A creature bitten by a poisonous toad must 
save vs, poison at +2. Failure means the victim falls comatose and 
will die within 24 hours unless treated.

Treants are strangely related to bath humans and trees, combin¬ 
ing features of both species, Peaceful by nature, ireants can cause 
great damage when roused to anger. They hate evil things and the 
unrestrained use of fire. 

Treants are almost indistinguishable from trees. Their skin is a 
thick, textured, brown bark. Their arms are gnarled like branch¬ 
es and their legs fit together when standing like the trunk of a 
tree. Above the eyes and along the head are dozens of smaller 
branches from which hang great leaves. In winter the leaves of a 
treant change color but rarely fall out. Treants are very intelli¬ 
gent and often speak a number of languages including their own. 
ell, dwarf, common, and a smattering of just about all other hu¬ 
manoid tongues (at least enough to say 'Get out of my trees! '), 

Combat; The combat ability of treants varies with their size. 
Young treants (13 or 14 feet) have 7 or 8 HlL Dice and inflict 2-16 
points of damage per attack Middle-aged treants (15 or 16 feet) 
have 9 or 10 Hit Dice, respectively and inflict 3-18 points of dam¬ 
age per attack. Elder treants (17 or IS feet) have 11 or 12 Hit Dice 
and inflict 4-24 points of damage per attack. 

Due to their tough, barklike skin, treants have a superior Ar* 
mor Class rating against almost all weapons. Their only weak¬ 
ness is fire. Any fire-based attack against a treant is at +4 to hit 
and +1 damage. In addition, treants save against all fire-based 
attacks at -4, This weakness to fire also applies to animated trees 
controlled by a treant. 

Treants have the ability to animate normal trees. One treant 
can animate up to two trees. It takes one round for a norma! tree 
to uproot itself. Thereafter the animated tree can move at a rate 
of 3 per turn and fights as a full-grown treant (12 Hit Dice, two 
attacks, 4-24 points of damage per attack), A treant must be 
within 60 yards of the tree it is attempting to animate* Animated 
trees lose their ability to move if the treant who animated them is 
incapacitated or moves more than 60 yards away, 

Treants (regardless of size) and t reant-con trolled trees can in¬ 
flict structural damage when attacking a building or fortification* 



HabitatSociety: Treants live in small communities, usually 
amidst old hardwood forests (oak. maple, mahogany, etc,). In 
the forest treants rarely reveal themselves, preferring not to inter¬ 
act with the more transient Jifeforms (anything with a lifespan of 
500 years or less). Humans and demihumans have only a slight 
chance of spotting a treant who is trying to blend in with the 
trees, Rangers have a fair chance of spotting a treant (10% per 
level), 

Treants are intolerant of evil particularly when fire and the 
wanton destruction of trees is involved* They hate ores and gob¬ 
lins with a passion and tend to be suspicious of anyone carrying 
an ax. 

Treants have no use for treasure, and usually place all such 
items somewhere out of sight, such as under a great rock* Occa¬ 
sionally a treant can be convinced to give up his treasure but only 
when some great good will be accomplished by this generosity. 

Ecology: Treants, like all trees, gain sustenance via photosyn¬ 
thesis, Treants often sleep for long periods of time (anywhere 
from a few days to several years) during which short roots grow 
into the ground beneath them gathering water and minerals from 
the soil. Reproduction is via off-shoot stalks which the female 
treants then protect and care for until the stalks are grown. 

The lifespan of a treant is not known, but is several thousand 
years at least* As they grow older, treants become slower and less 
agile, sleeping for longer periods and talking less of things that 
are and more of things that were. Eventually an old treant will 
not wake up, taking permanent root in the spot where he sleeps 
and living out the rest of his life as a normal tree.

Tritons are rumored to be creatures from the elemental plane of 
Water that have been placed on the Prime Material plane for 
some purpose unknown to man They are sea dwellers, inhabit¬ 
ing warmer waters principally but equally able to live at shallow 
or great depths. 

The lower half of a triton ends in two finned legs, while its 
torso, head, and arms are handsomely human. Tritons have a sil¬ 
very skin that fades into silver-blue scales on the lower half of 
their bodies. Their hair is deep blue or blue-green, Triton speak 
their own language as well as those of sea elves and lo cat hah, 

Combat: Tritons carry either tridents (60%) or long spears 
(40%), Some 25% are also armed with heavy crossbows. When 
equipped for battle, tritons wear armor made of scales [AC 4). 

Outside their lain tritons are 90% likely to be mounted, either 
on hippocampi (65%) or giant sea horses (35%). These mounts 
fight in defense of their riders. 

Exceptional tritons (see below) and triton leaders always carry 
conch shells with them. Not magical their sounds are well 
known to all marine creatures. When blown properly by an ex¬ 
ceptional triton, a conch summons 5d4 hippocampi, IdIO sea li¬ 
ons, or 5d6 giant sea horses. These creatures swim to the aid of 
the summoning triton arriving Id6 rounds after the conch is f irst 
sounded. Theconchs can also be sounded to frighten aquatic ani¬ 
mals as the fear spell. This latter noise causes all marine creatures 
within 60 feet and with animal Intelligence or less to flee in panic. 
Creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the fear 
effect, but even those who succeed with their saving throws have 
a -5 modifier on their attack rolls against the tritons. 

Triton are reclusive and nonviolent. They normally attack to 
capture. If a triton is killed in a battle, however, the fight immedi¬ 
ately becomes one of retribution. Should the fighting go poorly, 
the tritons withdraw to their lair to either gather reinforcements 
or make a last stand. 

In addition to their other abilities, tritons are nearly impervi¬ 
ous to magic with a natural magic resistance of 90%.

Habitat/Society: Tritons live either in great undersea castles 
(80% chance) or in finely sculpted caverns (20%). While tritons 
lean toward good alignment, they are very suspicious of outsid¬ 
ers and have no love for land dwellers in general. 

Tritons rarely kill unless provoked, but they are quick to ap¬ 
prehend those who intrude upon their seas. Trespassers found 
guilty of intentionally entering triton waters or treasure seeking 
are left "to the fate of the seas." This means being stripped of all 
belongings and set adrift at least 10 miles from any shoreline. 
Characters ruled innocent by the triton court awaken the next 
day on some distant shore. Tritons never aid land dwellers unless 
their own interests are involved in the matter. 

For every 10 tritons encountered there is an exceptional triton 
of 4-6 Hit Dice. For every 20 encountered there is an exceptional 
triton with 7-8 Hit Dice. Groups of 50 or more are always accom¬ 
panied by a triton leader (AC 2, 9 Hit Dice), There is a 10% 
chance for every 10 tritons encountered that they are accompa¬ 
nied by a triton mage of Ido levels. 

At a triton lair, the following additional tritons are always 
found: 

60 males (with related exceptional tritons) 

One mage of 7th- to 10th-level ability 

One priest of 8th- to 11th-level ability 

Four priests of 2nd- to Sth-level ability 

Female tritons equal to 100% of males (2 HD, AC 6) 

Young equal to 100% of males (noncombatants) 

There is also a 75% chance that the lair contains 2d6 sea lions as 
pets /guards. 

Ecology: Tritons are omnivorous and live on fish, shellfish, and 
sea weed. They have no natural enemies save the giant squid, 
which is immune to the effects of their conch shells. Normal tri¬ 
ton live approximately 300 years while their leaders and spell- 
casters have life expectancies of 500 years or more.

Troglodytes are a warlike race of carnivorous reptilian human¬ 
oids that dwell in natural subterranean caverns and in the cracks 
and crevices of mountains. They hate man above ail other crea¬ 
tures and often launch bloody raids on human communities in 
search of food and steel. 

Troglodytes stand about 6 feet tall, are covered in roughened 
leathery scales, and have a toothy lizard-like head. Males are eas¬ 
ily distinguished from females by the fin-like crest that runs 
across their heads and down their necks T Coloration for both 
sexes varies due to the troglodyte's chameleon-like ability to 
change skin tone, but grayish brown is most common. Most 
troglodytes wear little more than a leather weapons belt, with 
perhaps a small bag of semi-fresh meat. Leaders adorn their belts 
with pieces of steel, a sign of power in troglodyte culture. Troglo¬ 
dytes have excellent infravision (90-foot range). They speak their 
own language and no other. 

Combat: Fifty percent of a troglodyte force use their teeth and 
claws. The remaining 50% use weapons: swords (5%). stone 
battle axes (10% ) P stone morning stars (10%), or two troglodyte 
javelins (25%). Of special note is the troglodyte javelin. These 
great darts grant a +3 bonus to the attack roll when thrown by a 
troglodyte: they cause 2d4 points of damage. This bonus reflects 
the troglodytes' great skill with these darts. About 25% of troglo¬ 
dytes carry two such darts apiece, 

Troglodytes prefer ambushes to frontal assaults. Their favorite 
tactic is to pick a wdl-trod mountain or subterranean path and 
then use their chameleon power to blend in with the surrounding 
rocks, When a likely target walks by the troglodytes hurl a vol¬ 
ley of javelins (this attack gives opponents a -4 penalty to their 
surprise rolls, but only for the initial round). After a second vol¬ 
ley the troglodytes descend upon their hapless victims. 

When angered or engaged in melee, troglodytes secrete an oil 
that smells extremely disgusting to all humans and demihumans. 
Those failing their saving throws vs. poison are so revolted as to 
lose ld6 points of Strength. This loss remains in effect for 10 
rounds, 

Habitat-Society: Troglodyte society is organized into clans, 
with each dan led by a chieftain (usually the biggest and most 



fearsome troglodyte), A number of subchieftains also are 
present chosen from those troglodytes that most distinguished 
themselves in battle. Rank is loose and internal squabbles com¬ 
mon. Most chieftains lead only as long as the dan stays fed (and 
not one meal longer). 

For every 10 troglodytes encountered there is one leader with 3 
Hit Dice, For every 20 there are two subchieftains each with 4 Hit 
Dice. Groups of 60 or more always include the dan chieftain. 
The chieftain stands 7 feet tall, has 6 Hit Dice, and is accompa¬ 
nied by 2d4 guards with 3 HiL Dice each. 

Troglody tes usually set their lair near a human or demihuman 
settlement. This enables them to prey on both the settlers and 
their livestock. The lair itself is typically a large cave or cavern 
with a number of smaller chambers adjoining it for the females 
and hatchlings. Troglodyte lairs contain a number of females 
equal to 100% of the males. Females have 1 +1 Hit Dice each and 
fight to the death in defense of the hatchlings. Hatchlings number 
about 50% of the male population and are noncombatants. 

Troglodytes value steel above all else, using it to make javelins 
and as a form of wealth. Individual troglodytes carry nothing of 
real worth, but their lair may contain considerable treasure 
amassed from their raids on the outside world. Often this wealth 
is carelessly strewn about, mixed in with half-eaten food, or just 
shoved into some out-of-the-way corner. 

On moonless nights, raiding parties of 50 or more troglodytes 
venture forth in search of steel and food. These attacks usually 
target human settlements, where the troglodytes can use their 
infravision and their chameleon power to maximum advantage. 

Ecology: Strict carnivores, troglodytes prefer human flesh over 
ail others, but they won't hesitate to devour practically anything 
they can catch, including members of other troglodyte dans. Few 
creatures hunt troglodytes, for their taste is said to be even more 
vile than their odor.

Trulls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to 
tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, since trolls know no 
fear and attack unceasingly when hungry. Their frame appears thin and 
trail, but trolls possess surprising strength. Their arms and legs are long 
and ungainly. The legs end in great three-toed feel, the arms in wide, 
powerful hands with sharpened claws The trolls' rubbery hide is colored 
a moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. A writhing hairlike 
mass grows out of their skulls and is usually greenish black or iron gray in 
colon Their dull, sunken black eyes possess 90-foot infra vision. Females 
are easily distinguished from males; they are both larger and more pow¬ 
erful than their male counterparts. 

Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The 
trolls gait is uneven and. when running, the arms dangle free and drag 
along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very' agile 
They are masterful climbers and can scale even sheer cliffs with art 30% 
chance of success. Trolls have a poor hearing, but their sense of smell is 
superior. 

Trolls have no language of their own, using Urolkpeak' a guttural 
mishmash of common, giant, goblin, ore, and hobgoblin, Trollspeak is 
highly transient and trolls from one area are only 25% likely to be able to 
communicate with trolls from another, 

Combat: Trolls attack w ith two clawed hands and their bile, and they can 
attack at multiple opponents. In the rare case that a troll wields a weap¬ 
on. it attacks with a +3 damage bonus. Trolls regenerate at an amazing 
rate. Starting three rounds after first blood, the creatures recovers 3 hit 
points per round until healed. Trolls reduced to 0 or fewer hit points fall 
to the ground, incapacitated but not slain. Incapacitated trolls continue 
to regenerate and stand up to fight as soon as they have a positive number 
of hit points. 

When using an edged weapon, it Is possible to sever the thin limbs of a 
troll (a natural 20 with an edged weapon is needed). Severed limbs con¬ 
tinue to fight after separation from the body [hands squeeze, heads bite if 
stepped on, etc.), Attacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit. 
Separated limbs fight for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back 
and rebind with the body once the battle is over Umbs unable to reach 
the body to die within 24 hours, but this is of little consequence since 
trolls regenerate lost body parts (including the head) within a week. If a 
troll is dismembered and scattered, the largest surviving piece regener¬ 
ates. The others die within one day if they cannot rejoin that piece. Only 
fire and acid cause permanent damage to trolls. These forms of attack 
destroy its regenerative ability, A troll reduced to 0 or fewer hit points 
and immersed in add or burned with fire is killed. 

Trolls have no fear of death, and launch themselves into combat j flail¬ 
ing wildly at their opponents and biting whoever comes closest. They 
occasionally '25%) throw stones before dosing with their victims. 


Thrown stones have a maximum range of 20 yards, weigh 10 to 20 
pounds, and inflict ld8 points of damage, If confronted by a large natural 
or magical fire, trolls try to find some way around the flames. Trolls com¬ 
bine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence, so they are frequently 
distracted and break off pursuit 50% of the time to pick up food dropped 
by fleeing prey 

Habilat'Suuety: Trolls can survive in all dimes, but prefer dense forests 
and subterranean locales, since bright sunlight hurts their eyes; trolls suf¬ 
fer no combat penalties because of this. They usually make their lairs in 
caveSj using great boulders to block the entrances. Inside a troll cave are a 
number of rough nests made of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and 
treasure from victims. 11 there are no caves in an area, trolls dig them¬ 
selves a trollhole and cover its opening with twigs and leaves. Trollholes 
are usually built near trees and are 90% undetectable. Anyone who steps 
on a trollhole is 75% likely to fall through the leafy door and tumble into 
the den below. 

Trolls live in small packs of 3 to 12 trolls led by a dominant female who 
acts as shaman/chieftain. She casts priest spells at 7th level; spheres typi¬ 
cally include Charm. Divination, Sun (Darkness only), and Weather. 
Leadership is only retained by combat, so fights for pack control are fre¬ 
quent, Often trolls rend each other limb from limb, but these battles are 
never fatal. Still, it is the custom of trolls to loss the loser s head a great 
distance from the fight scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a 
week until their new head grows in. 

The pack chieftain's duties are few' She leads the trolls on nightly for¬ 
ages, loping along, sniffing the air for prey, If a scent is found, the trolls 
charge, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry once prey is 
spotted. In return for being the hunt leader, the shaman gets her choice of 
mates in the pack. Females give birth to a single troll about once every 
five years. 

Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from simple 
grubs to bears and humans. Their lairs are often located near human 
settlements or along well traveled roads, but not too near, for even trolls 
respect organized resistance by fire-bearing humans. Wandering trolls, in 
search of a new |air r travel by night and sleep by day. Ravenous from 
walking, these packs, on occasion, attack and devour entire humanoid 
villages. 

Ecology: Trolls prey on all but the most powerful of creatures. They re¬ 
spect and (car dragons, but they hate giants of good alignment and wage 
war with them frequently. The trolls green blood is used to manufacture 
both poison antidotes and healing potions. The blood from one troll, 
worth 400 gp, can make three such potions.

Troll 


Giant Two Headed Troll 

These ferocious troll, ettin crossbreeds posses a mottled greenish brown skin 
tone, and iheir dress is usually moth-eaten rags or animal skins. Twoheaded 
trolls use trollspeak as their language. Though part Ettin, these monsters re- 
tain many of the abilities of trolls, They regenerate like trolls, but only 1 hit 
point a round and severed limbs cannot reattach (their thicker limbs are not 
cleaved on a roll of 20). Two-headed trolls attack with two daws and two 
bites. Both bite attacks are against one opponent, but the daws may be di¬ 
rected against different foes. The troll can, though rarely, wield a weapon 
with a + o damage bonus. Like ettins, two-headed trolls are surprised only on 
a 1. These creatures live in damp, underground caverns and can be found 
leading groups of their smaller troll cousins. 

Freshwater Troll (Scrag; 

These gibed trolls, ako called scrags or river trolls, are the most loath¬ 
some of all the trolls, River troEls, as their name implies, travel the water¬ 
ways in search ot victims. Their arms are thin and frail but their mouths 
are wide and lined with dozens of needle-sharp tangs. Their color ranges 
from blue-green to olive. Scrags have all oi the abilities of normal trolls, 
but they only regenerate when immersed in fresh water. Scrags can but 
vive out of water for one hour and often come ashore in search of prey 
River trolls devour anything they catch, but prefer humanoids and have a 
fondness for dwarves. 

Scrags are devious hunters and often carry a few baubles with them. 
They lay gems, near the waters edge and wait for someone to spot them 
and reach down. Other traps include burying themselves in the sand, in 
shallow water, and waiting to be stepped on or tangling the rudders of 
small boats River trolls occasionally nest beneath bridges or near ferry 
boats, demanding a toll in exchange for passage. The toll varies, but av¬ 
erages the equivalent oi one cow per week, per troll. Livestock and chib 
dren frequently disappear when river trolls are near. Scrag shamans also 
have access to Eemental (water) spells 

Saltwater Troll [Marine Scrag) 

Like freshwater scrags, marine scrags cart breathe air for one hour and 
have all of the abilities ot normal trolls, except they regenerate only when 
immersed Ln saltwater, Large green, and pot-bellied, marine scrags are 
thick-skinned and heavily scaled. Limp hair, the color uf seaweed, hangs 
down to their shoulders. Their feet are wide and webbed to aid them in 
swimming. While their limbs are shorter and weaker than those of ordi¬ 
nary trolls* their mouths are larger and filled with hundreds of needle- 
sharp teeth Marine scrags can subsist on fish and shellfish, but crave 
human flesh. They create their lairs in shallow ocean caves or beneath 
city docks. They emerge from their caves at night, climbing over ship 
railings in search of sailors or hunting the piers for a strolling couple or a 
lone drunk. Their attacks are quick and stealthy; they usually hunt in 
packs of four to sbe, but occasionally, several dozen may attack a large 
ship. Marine scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water! spells. 

Desert Trolls 

Desert trolls are usually tan. but can modify their color from bleached 
tan to mottled rock brown, causing a -2 penalty to opponents surprise 
rolls. Their keen senses and animal cunning reduce their chances of being 
surprised to l-Ln-10. Like normal trolls the desert variety usually attacks 
with two claws and a bite. 

Desert trolls are immune to normal tiro, heat, and cold. They do not 
regenerate acid damage damage from magical fire, or fire breath weap¬ 
ons In addition, they suffer damage from normal water that cannot be 
regenerated Normal water inflicts ld4 points of damage per vial, 2d4 
points per flask, and 4d4 points per skin A foamier of endless water 
aimed directly at a desert troll (successful attack roll required) causes 25 
points of damage per round, Puri l ied water 1 including normal and holy 
water! causes double damage. A potion of sweet water causes 6d6 points 
of damage and the troll must make a saving throw vs. poison or die. 

These trolls are rougher and more tenacious than their more common 
counterparts, but they are also more solitary. They skulk at the edges of 
settled areas, waylaying travelers and polluting sources ol pure water 

Spectral Troll Troll Wraith) 

Spectral trolls, taking material form only in darkness, are tormented by 
the memory of life. They try to slay all living creatures they encounter. 
Resembling normal trolls in all respects except color, their jet black skin 
and hair make them easily distinguishable from other trolls, Spectral 
trolls have the same attacks us regular trolls and can divide them among 



many opponents, A silver or magical weapon is needed to attack them, 
making the final disposition of a spectral troll an even trickier prospect. 

Being undead, spectral trolls can be turned by priests as Lhough they 
were specters. It is noted that a humanoid slain by a spectra) troll be¬ 
comes one itself in three days, unless a proper burial ceremony is per¬ 
formed by a priest of the victim s religion Spectra] trolls vanish in direct 
sunlight. They do not take damage trom sunlight, they merely tade from 
view and reappear at the same spot at nightfall, Even those captured, 
unconscious, or trapped in temporal stash have escaped permanent im¬ 
prisonment in this manner. 

Giant Trolls 

Giant Trolls are hideous hill giant trol] crossbreeds. They resemble nor¬ 
mal trolls in all respects, except for their unnatural size. Their skin is red* 
dish brown and they have red-rimmed eyes. 

Despite their pot-bellied appearance, giant trolls are immensely strong 
and inflict damage [ike a hiJI giant when they are using their favorite 
weapon of attack—a large spiked dub made from a tree trunk or a house 
timber. These dubs cause 2d6 + 7 points ot damage. In those rare in¬ 
stances when a giant troll has no weapons, its claws inllict Ido + 1 points 
of damage; as with all trolls, the claw attacks can be divided among dif¬ 
ferent opponents as necessary, 

Instead of using their claws to attack weaponless giant trolls are more 
likely to grab medium-sized prey in their large hands and wield the strug¬ 
gling victim like a dub, beating a new target with the body. Refer to the 
rules on hand-to-hand combat in the Dungeon Masters Guide for guide¬ 
lines. 

Giant trolls who are overwhelmed by many small- and medium-sized 
opponents take time to grab and hurl the warriors into nearby trees, leav¬ 
ing more time to deal with the softer, weaker enemies. Note that, like hill 
giants, giant trolls can catch missiles 25% of the time, If in reach, and can 
hurl boulders that cause 2d8 points of damage. 

Unlike norma) trolls and their doser relatives, giant trolls never attack 
with their bite. This is due to the fact that they are much taller than the 
meals they like best (humanoids, of course), and they find i( difficult to 
bend forward with the flexibility normal trolls ertjoy.Then too. the head 
of a giant troll, more than any other part of the cross-breed anatomy, is 
almost identical to that of a hill giant, except that their skin is reddish 
brown. The giant troll also lacks the razor sharp teeth of normal trolls 
that strike fear in so many 


350 




Troll 


Giant [rolls regenerate damage as normal trolls, but at the rate of 2 hit 
points per round They cannot reattach severed timbs. Before a giant troll 
can be killed, at least 10 points of damage must be inflicted on il by fire. If 
this condition is not met, and the giant troll is reduced to a single hit 
point, further damage has no effect, except to prevent regeneration. 

They have a very acute sense of smell and 90-foot infra vision. Giant 
trolls are feared throughout the world, for not only do they possess the 
horrible ability to regenerate damage inflicted upon them, bul they also 
possess the power and strength of hill giant* i| fearsome in their own 
right). The combination is a deadly one. and, even worse, giant trolls 
travel in loose tribal bands of ldl2 members. They are rarely encountered 
alone, Lairs of giant trolls are always served by 2do normal trolls who act 
as simple lackeys "and sometimes food) for their larger cousins. 

Giant trolls are found in nearly every clime. Giant trolls are on good 
terms with strong hill giant tribes, lor which they serve as elite personal 
guardians for the ruling chief, 

Ice Troll 

The ice troll is a smaller, more intelligent relative of the normal troll, and 
is probably the result of magical experimentation. It closely resembles its 
more common cousin, but has semitransparent, very cold skin. Ice trolls 
are famous tor being cunning, evil creatures which keep humans and 
demi-humans as livestock. Because ice trolls need water to regenerate 
they never leave their Jakes and rivers, and will create elaborate traps to 
lure their prey to them. 

Ice trolls are organized and intelligent enough to know their weakness¬ 
es, and rarely start a light at a disadvantage. Unlike their larger and less 
intelligent cousins, they do not wade into combat blindly, bul will try to 
pick off weaker opponents one by one, hoping to bring back live prey. Ice 
trolls generally attack with claws for JdfS hit points of damage each, but 
have been known to use weapons on rare ticcasions 00%), at an addi¬ 
tional + 4 to each weapon s damage due to Strength, Attacks may be di¬ 
rected against different opponents. 

The regenerative powers of ice trolls are not as great as normal trolls. 
An ice troll must be immersed in water to be able to regenerate t hit 
points per melee round- The creatures often make their stand in a shallow 
pool of water to keep this advantage. 

Because of the thin, brittle nature of the ice troll, it is possible to sever 
one o! the creatures limbs with an edged weapon, on a natural attack roll 
of 20 with an edged weapon. Severed limbs also regenerate 2 hit points 
per turn, as long as they are immersed in water. If a severed limb is not in 
contact with water, it will move up to 30 feet in search of water, always 
moving toward it, if it is in range. 

Fire and acid are the only attack forms which negate the ice troll's ability 
to regenerate. 

Because ol the ice troll s physiology, fire-based attacks do double dam¬ 
age. Ice trolls are unaffected by cold or cold-based spells, and because of 
their magical nature, can only be hit by magical weapons or missiles. 

Ice trolls live in groups of 7-12 in arctic and sub-arctic regions, near 
open water. Because they are smaller and less resilient than their larger 
cousins, they have developed a higher sense of cooperation to stay alive. 
Each group has a leader, usually the most intelligent. Leaders are respon¬ 
sible for keeping the group safe and well-fed. 

Ice trolls live near settled regions, hoping to waylay and capture hu 
mans and demi-humans. Ice trolls will frequently bait traps for adventur¬ 
ers, using treasure they have salvaged from previously waylaid groups. 
Settlements also provide more common livestock, which, although less 
preferable than human flesh, is considered edible in times of need. Ice 
trolls establish their lairs near lakes or rivers. Here the ice trolls will have 
gathered all Lheir treasure, as well as 5-20 human or demi-human cap¬ 
tives, These prisoners are kept well-fed on grains and vegetables, so that 
the ice trolls need never go too long without food. 

Ice trolls mate in the spring and give birth to one baby ice troll in the 
late tall, When an ice troll tribe gets too largo it splits one group wander¬ 
ing off to find a new lair Ice trolls that live in arctic regions often hunt 
remorhaz, and will even pick off a solitary frost giant, ke troll blood is 
frequently used in the manufacture of frost brand swords, and ring* of 
cold resistance. 



Spirit Trolls 

The spirit troll is an odious mutation of the spectral troll. Several schools 
of thought completely separate this creature from the spectral variety, 
presenting evidence that the spirit troll b a perverted magical interbreed¬ 
ing of trolls and invisible stalkers. The spirit troll is invisible: characters 
able to see invisible objects observe it to be very similar to a Iroll. slightly 
shorter and with diffused features. The spirit troll can only be hit by mag^ 
ical weapons. Fire inflicts Lull damage, but it is invulnerable to cold-based 
attacks. It regenerates as does a troll, and at the same rate. 

It attacks with its tangs and two sharp claw r s, against three different 
opponents if it so desired. The damage inflicted by its fangs (2d4 +2) is 
normal damage, except that the spirit troll adds the damage to its own hit 
points—in effect healing itself! The damage inflicted by the spirit troll's 
daws (ld4 +2) is taken not only from the victim s hit points but also from 
Strength. Strength points lost in this way are recovered in 2d4 turns. If a 
characters Strength is reduced to 0. the PC dies. II the Strength is reduced 
to 1 or 2 points, the PC is rendered comatose, only recovering when land 
if) sufficient hit points are recovered to raise the Strength to 3 or more 
The spirit troll has an acute sense of smell and superior, 120 foot-range 
infravision.

Umber hulks are power!ul subterranean predators whose iron- 
like daws allow them to burrow through solid stone in search of 
prey 

Umber hulks are tremendously strong, standing nearly 8 feet 
tall and over 5 feet wide, Musdes bulge beneath their thick, scaly 
hides and their powerful arms and legs ail carry great claws. 
They have no necks to speak of, but the head features a powerful 
maw with rows of triangular teeth and 8-inch mandibles capable 
of biting through any hide or bone. Most peculiar of all are the 
four round eyes, spaced evenly across each umber hulks fore¬ 
head. Umber hulks are black, shading to a lighter shade of 
yellowish gray on the front, Their eyes are mere blackened 
dots each the size of a small coin. Umber hulks have their own 
language. 


Combat: For all of their monstrous features, umber hulks are 
intelligent opponents, They usually dig to a point adjacent to a 
main corridor, then wait, peeking through a crack they've made, 
until likely prey walks by. The umber hulk then springs out upon 
its startled victim. When using this technique, opponents have a - 
5 modifier on their surprise rolls. Other tactics involve planned 
cave-Lns and dead-end tunnels where an umber hulk can wait For 
victims to come to him. Their burrowing rate varies from 10 feet 
per turn in solid stone to 60 feet per turn in soft earth. 

In melee, umber hulks can deliver a vicious bite but, under¬ 
standably, their main weapon is their great daws. Worse, look¬ 
ing mlo an umber hulk's eyes causes confusion, as per the spell, 
unless a saving throw versus spell is made. In addition to this 
special confusion attack the outer eyes oi an umber hulk provide 
the creature with infravision to a distance of 90 feet. 

The one saving grace when lighting an umber hulk is their 
speed. Their gall is slow and ponderous and their balance is poor 
in wide spaces. 

Umber hulks never fight to the death unless cornered (which is 
rare, since the creature can dig through stone). If hard pressed, 
an umber hulk won t hesitate to cause a cave-in (23% chance of 
success per round) and then dig his way to freedom. 



HabitatSodety Umber hulks dwell in the depths of the earth. 
They raid dungeons for food, much Lhe way ant eaters raid ant colo¬ 
nies, eating their fill and then moving on to let the " colony' recover. 

Umber hulks are usually solitary hunters. Males and females 
mate, then go their separate ways. One to three young are born 
about a year later in a special nursery which has been hollowed 
out by the female. Two years later, once the hulklings are big 
enough, the female begins taking them with her when hunting. It 
is during this period that unfortunate victims may stumble across 
more than one umber hulk at a time. 

No umber hulk culture is known, but it is rumored that there 
may be entire cities of these beings underground with tunnels 
that radiate out, like threads in a spider s web, toward the nearer 
dungeons and mountain ranges. If true, this would explain much, 
for umber hulks seem to disappear or spring up in a region at will 
and always take great care in hiding their tunnels behind them, 

Ecology: Umber hulks eat young purple worms, ankhegs, and 
similar creatures. Their favorite prey however, is humankind. 

Vodyanoi 

These aquatic predators are closely related to the umber hulk, 
Vodyanoi live in deep bodies of fresh water* They are similar in 
appearance to umber hulks but have only two eyes and thus lack 
the ability to confuse opponents. Their skin is green and slimy to 
the touch, but beneath it is a thick, knobby hide. Their claws are 
webbed. Vodyanoi prey upon all manner of creatures but prefer 
human flesh. They can rend the hulls of small vessels and fre¬ 
quently sink or overturn small boats. Once per day a vodyanoi 
can attempt to summon 1-20 electric eels with a 50% chance of 
success. The existence of a saltwater variety of vodyanoi of twice 
the size and greater ferocity is rumored but unconfirmed.

Unicorns dwell only in temperate woodlands, away from human 
habitation. These fierce but good creatures shun contact with all 
but sylvan creatures (dryads, pixies, sprites, and the like): how¬ 
ever, they will show themselves to defend their woodland home. 

Powerful steeds with gleaming coats of pure white hair, Uni¬ 
com eyes are usually deep sea blue or fiery pink. Long, silky 
white strands of hair hang down from the mane and forelock. A 
single ivory-colored horn, 2 to 3 feet In length, grows from the 
center of each unicorn s forehead. Males are distinguished by the 
white beard beneath the chin: females by their more elegant and 
slimmer musculature. The hooves of a unicorn are cloven and 
yellow-ivory in color. Unicorns speak their own language as well 
as those of other sylvan creatures and elves. 

Combat; Unicorns can sense an enemy from 240 yards away. 
Likewise, unicorns move very silently, so opponents are penal¬ 
ized -6 on their surprise rolls. Unicorns can kick with their front 
hooves and thrust with the horn each round. Due to the horn's 
magical nature, it always has a +2 bonus to hit, Unicorns can 
charge into battle, using the horn like a lance. To make this 
charge, there must be at least 30 feet of open space between the 
unicorn and his opponent. Opponents struck by a charging uni¬ 
corn suffer 3-36 points of damage from impaling. Unicorns may 
not attack with their front hooves in the round they charge. 

Once per day a unicorn can use a teleport spell of limited 
range. This spell will transport the unicorn {and its rider) to any 
place that the unicorn desires* up to 360 yards away. Unicorns 
often use this ability as a last resort to avoid death or capture. 

In addition, unicorns can never be charmed or he/d by magic. 
They are immune to death spells and make all saving throws 
against spells as if they were wizards of 11th level. Unicorns are 
immune to poison. 

Habitat Society: Unicorns mate for life and make their home in 
an open dell of the forest they have chosen to protect. There, in 
the boles of the trees, unicorns etch a glyph, recognizable to syl¬ 
van creatures, indicating that the forest is under unicorn protec¬ 
tion, Rangers have a 10% chance per level of determining 



correctly whether a forest is guarded by unicorns. Once a wood¬ 
land has a unicorn protector, no other unicorn will enter that for¬ 
est unless the forest is very large. Each family of unicorns stakes 
out a territory approximately 400 square miles (20 miles by 20 
miles). 

Travelers may pass through a unicorn's forest freely and even 
hunt there* but anyone killing for sport or damaging the forest 
maliciously will be attacked if the unicorn is nearby (10% 
chance), The ferocity of this attack is determined by the evil of 
the trespasser. Truant youths throwing stones at animals, for ex¬ 
ample, would be driven off with just a few bruises as a reminder, 
while pillaging ores would be hunted down and slain 

Lone unicorns occasionally allow themselves to be tamed and 
ridden by a human or elf maiden of pure heart and good align¬ 
ment. A unicorn that submits once and is treated kindly will act 
as the maiden's steed for life, even carrying her beyond the realm 
of his forest if she so desires. Unicorns make exceptionally loyal 
mounts and will protect their riders even unto death. 

Ecology: Unicorns are herbivores, living on tender leaves and 
grasses. Their only enemies are griffons and those creatures who 
destroy forests, in particular red dragons and ores. 

The life span of unicorns has never been recorded but is known 
to surpass 1,000 years. They are believed to maintain their youth 
until death is only weeks away. The secret to this longevity is the 
strong magical nature of the horn, Unicom horns are highly 
sought after, since possession of one is a sovereign remedy 
against all poisons. Alternately, a single horn can be used, by an 
alchemist, to manufacture 2-12 potions of healing Unicom 
horns sell for 1,500 gold pieces or more on the open market.

Urchins are a family of marine creatures that, like oysters, are 
hunted for the value of the stones found in their bodies. 

They resemble 3-foot-d La meter balls covered with thousands 
of 3-inch-long, needle-sharp spines. There are several species of 
urchins, which can be distinguished from each other by their dis¬ 
tinctive colors. 

Combat: Urchins can fire their spines with the distance and ac¬ 
curacy of light crossbows. An urchin can fire multiple spines per 
round as listed above under "No. of Attacks.' 1 Urchins have no 
eyes with which to see their opponents; instead they possess an 
innate clairvoyance ability. This ability gives all spines fired by 
urchins a +2 bonus to the attack roll. Damage from an urchin 
spine varies from species to species and many spines contain par¬ 
alytic or even lethal poisons. Since urchins are covered with 
thousands of spines, they have a virtually unlimited supply of 
ammunition. 

Habitat Society: Urchins are primarily scavengers, scouring 
the ocean floors for remains of shellfish. Occasionally they hunt 
fish, but they never attack man-sized beings unless threatened or 
approached within 10 feet. 

Urchins live in the shallows and upon shoals near the coast. 
They occasionally (10% chance) remain on land during low tide 
to scavenge for food. While on land, urchins move via rolling, 
They are capable of surprisingly high speeds when moving this 
way 

Ecology: inside each urchin is a crystalline organ-gem that 
seems to have some connection to their innate clairvoyance abili¬ 
ty. While this gem has little value as a stone, it is highly prized by 
alchemists. The exact value of the organ-gem depends on quality 
and the type of urchin it was taken from. To determine a stone's 
value, consult the Treasure" entry above. 

Land Urchin 

These distant cousins of sea urchins live strictly on land, Land 
urchins move on five spindly legs. They are shy creatures and 


only attack if approached within ten feet. Their paralytic poison 
lasts for six turns. Land urchins have no organ-gem but often 
(80% chance) form pearls inside their bodies. Old urchins con¬ 
tain 2d6 such pearls, each valued at ld6 x 100 gold pieces.

Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the world, none 
is more dreadf ul than the vampire. Moving silently through the 
night, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compas¬ 
sion, Unless deep underground, they must return to the coffins in 
which they pass the daylight hours, and even in the former case 
they must occasionally return to such to rest, for their power is 
renewed by contact with soil from their graves. 

One aspect that makes the vampire far more tearful than many 
of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead 
creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men with¬ 
out drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are 
sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a 
vampires true nature is revealed only when it attacks. 

There are ways in which a vampire may be detected bv the 
careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, 
cast no shadows, and move in complete silence. 

Combat: When engaging in combat, vampires are savage and 
fearsome opponents. They are physically very powerful, with a 
Strength score of 16/76, receiving a bonus of +2 to hit and +4 to 
damage The crushing blows of a vampire's attack are so tierce 
that they inflict 5-10 points of damage. 

The gaze of a vampire is one of its most powerful and danger¬ 
ous weapons. Any person who allows the vampire to look into 
his eyes will be affected as if by a charm person spell. Due to the 
power of this enchantment, a -2 is applied to the victim's saving 
throw vs. spell. In this manner, vampires are often able to pass 
posted sentries and surprise their chosen victims. 

Like all undead creatures, vampires exist in both the Positive 
Material and Negative Material planes at the same time. Their 
powerful negative essence allows them to drain two life energy 
levels from anyone they strike. If the vampire is making use of 
some form of weapon in the attack, it cannot employ this power. 

Weapons of less than +1 enchantment pass through vampires 
without harming them in any wav. Even if attacked with and 
harmed by magical weapons, vampires regenerate 3 hit points 
per round. If reduced to zero hit points, a vampire is not de¬ 
stroyed, but is forced to assume gaseous form. Once in this state, 
it will attempt to flee and return to its coffin where, after eight 
hours of rest, it regains its corporeal form. If the defeated vam¬ 
pire is unable to reach its coffin within 12 turns, however, its es¬ 
sence breaks up and the creature is truly destroyed. 



S/eep. charm ( and hold spells do not affect vampires. Similarly, 
they are unharmed by poisons and immune to paralysis Spells that 
are based on cold or electricity cause only half damage. 

At will, vampires are able to disperse their bodies into clouds 
of elemental vapor and assume gaseous form , In this state, they 
are all but immune to attack and can escape from almost any 
confinement. In addition, vampires can shape change so as to 
take on the form of a large bat (hence the flying movement rate 
given above). 

Vampires can summon lesser creatures for aid. In a subterra¬ 
nean environment, they will typically call forth a swarm of 10- 
100 rats or bats. In the case of the latter, these do not physically 
attack but serve to confuse and obscure the vision of the vam¬ 
pire's toes. In the wilderness, a vampire will normally cal) upon 
3-18 wolves for assistance. In all cases, the summoned animals 
arrive in 2-12 rounds. 

At will, a vampire can use a spider climb ability and scale sheer 
surfaces. Often, they will employ this power to gain access to 
rooms on upper floors without alerting those on watch down¬ 
stairs. This power also permits the vampire to seek refuge in plac¬ 
es which are all but beyond the reach of mortal men. 

Despite the great powers w T hich vampires obviously possess, 
they are not without weaknesses of their own. The odor of strong 
garlic repels them and they will not approach it. Further, they will 
recoil From the face of a mirror or lawful good holy symbol if ei¬ 
ther of these is presented to them wiLh courage and conviction. It is 
important to understand, however, that this will not actually harm 
the vampire in any way nor drive it off. Garlic will prevent the 
creature from attacking or entering the area, while mirrors and ho¬ 
ly symbols farce the vampire to find some means of removing the 
offending object before it can be bypassed. In most cases, the vam¬ 
pire will seek to overcome these hazards with the aid of its min¬ 
ions, For example, a charmed person might be called upon to 
attack someone who is holding the vampire at bay with a holy 
symbol. Another important point to keep in mind is that a lawful 
good holy symbol wiJ) affect the vampire regardless of the vam- 


355 













Vampire 


pi re's original religious background. Vampires which are splashed 
with a vial of holy water or struck with lawful good holy symbols 
are burned by them, suffering 2-7 points of damage. 

Just as vampires can be kept at bay so too can they be slain by 
those who have the knowledge to do so. Any vampire which is 
exposed to direct sunlight is instantly rendered powerless and, 
after one round, utterly annihilated. If the vampire can be im¬ 
mersed in running water, it loses one-third of its hit points each 
round, until destroyed on the third round. Last, a vampire can be 
killed by having a wooden stake driven through its heart. In this 
case, however, the creature can be restored simply by removing 
the stake if further measures are not taken to ensure the fate of 
the vampire. In order for it to be completely destroyed, the vam¬ 
pires head must be cut off and its mouth stuffed with holy wafers 
for their equivalent). 

In addition to its aversion to items like garlic and holy sym¬ 
bols, the vampire acts under many other limitations* One of the 
most powerful of these is the creatures inability to enter a home 
without being first invited to do so by a resident of the dwelling. 
This does not apply to public buildings and places of business 
which, by their very nature, extend an "invitation" to all* Once a 
vampire has been invited to enter a residence, it may come and 
go freely afterward. A common maimer for obtaining permission 
to enter a home is the use of the vampires gaze to charm a ser¬ 
vant or other inhabitant. 

Any human or humanoid creature slain by the life energy 
drain of a vampire is doomed to become a vampire himself. 
Thus, those who would hunt these lords of the undead must be 
very careful lest they find themselves condemned to a fate far 
worse than death. The transformation takes place one day after 
the burial of the creature. Those who are not actually buried* 
however, do not become undead and it is thus traditional that the 
bodies of a vampires victims be burned or similarly destroyed* 
Once they become undead, the new vampire is under the com¬ 
plete control of its killer. If that vampire is destroyed, the con¬ 
trolled undead are freed from its power and become self-willed 
creatures. 

In most cases, vampires do not lose the abilities and knowledge 
which they had in life when they become undead. Thus, it is pos¬ 
sible for a vampire to have the powers of. for example, a wizard, 
thief, or even priest. In all cases, of course, the new vampire be¬ 
comes chaotic evil. 

Habitat/Society: Vampires live in areas of death and desolation 
where they will not be reminded of the lives they have left be¬ 
hind. Ruined castles or chapels and large cemeteries are popular 
lairs for them, as are sites of great tragedies or battles. Vampires 
often feel a strong attachment to specific areas with some morbid 
significance, like the grave of a suicide or the site of a murder. 

When deciding on a course of action or planning a campaign, 
vampires move very slowly and meticulously. It is not uncommon 
for a vampire to undertake some scheme which may take decades 
or even centuries to reach its conclusion. Because of the curse of 
immortality that has fallen upon them, they feel that time is always 
on their side and will often defeat foes who might otherwise over¬ 
come them; the vampire can simply go into hiding for a few dec¬ 
ades until the passing of the years brings down its enemies. 

Vampires are normally solitary creatures* When they are 
found in the company of others of their kind, the group will cer¬ 
tainly consist of a single vampire lord and a small group of vam¬ 
pires which it has created to do its bidding* In this way, the 
vampire can exert its power over a greater range without running 


the risk of exposing itself to attack by would-be heroes. 

In general, vampires feel only contempt for the world and its 
inhabitants. Denied the pleasures of a true life, they have become 
dark and twisted creatures bent on revenge and terror. When a 
vampire creates another of its kind, it considers the new creature 
a mere tool. The minion will be sent on missions which the vam¬ 
pire feels may be too dangerous or unimportant for its personal 
attention* If the need arises, these pawns will gladly be sacrificed 
to protect or further the ends of their master* 

Ecology: The vampire has no place in the world of living crea¬ 
tures. It is a thing of darkness that exists only to bring about evil 
and chaos. Almost without exception, the vampire is feared and 
hated by those who dwell in the regions in which it chooses to 
make its home* The vampires unnatural presence is all-pervasive 
and will cause dogs and similar animals to raise a cry of alarm at 
the presence of the creature* 

Vampires sustain themselves by draining the life force from liv¬ 
ing creatures. Unless they have a specific need to create addition¬ 
al minions, however, they are careful to avoid killing those they 
attack. In cases where the death of a victim is desired, the vam¬ 
pire will take care to see that the body is destroyed and thus will 
not rise as an undead. 

Eastern Vampires; 

This breed of vampire is, if anything, even more frightful than its 
western cousin. Although they share many of the western vam¬ 
pires strengths and weaknesses, they have the ability to fade 
from sight at will* Once they have become invisible, they receive 
all of the normal bonuses which such a state normally bestows, 
including being attacked at -4. These monsters are unable to 
charm their victims, however, and cannot assume gaseous form 
at will as western vampires can.

Wemics are leonine counterparts to centaurs. 

A wemic's body consists of a leonine body with a humanoid 
torso extending from what would be a lion's neck. The typical 
wemic measures ten feet from head to rump. When standing erect 
in centaurian posture, the wemic stands 6 to 7 feet tall. 

Most of the body is covered in dusky golden fur, The tail is 
tipped by a brush of long, black hair. Adult males also have a 
mane of long black hair: the mane covers the top and back of the 
head and extends to the neck and shoulders. Male cubs develop 
this mane in their third year. The underbelly is covered in short, 
white fur. The nose may be black or russet. The eyes are gold 
with vertically slit pupils. The digits on all Hmbs end in daws. 
The claws on the forelegs are retractable, 

Wemics speak their own leonine language and a highly accent¬ 
ed dialect of the common tongue. 


Combat: Wemics use forepaws and weapons to attack. A daw 
delivers a vidous swipe that inflicts ld4 points of damage. Nor- 
mally the wemic uses his forelegs to daw and employs his hands 
to wield a weapon. 

Wemic males carry javelins and either a stone dub or short 
sword. They often carry a tough leather shield (AC 5) for protec¬ 
tion. Females are AC 7 and do not use weapons; however, they 
gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls if their cubs are attacked* Cubs 
under 2 years do not attack, 

Wemics possess keen senses* They are masters of ambushes 
and hunting strategy If they cannot surprise an intended victim, 
1-3 wemics move to outflank prey. 

Wemics possess powerful leg muscles. They can leap 10 feet 
upward or 30 feet forward. 

Habit at/5 ode !y: Wemic sodety is a blend of leonine and ab¬ 
original human cu ltures* They live in groups called prides. A typ¬ 
ical pride consists of 4d4 adult males, 2dl2 adult females, and 
ld!2 cubs. 



Up to 3dl0 prides often band together into a tribe that is led by 
a chief. The chief has an Armor Class of 5, 6 + 4 Hit Dice, and its 
daws inflict ld6 points of damage, It gains a +1 bonus to its 
attack rolls with any weapon. 

Sometimes 2d4 tribes join together into a clan or nation. Such 
a grand gathering is led by a king and 2d4 chieftains. The king 
has an Armor Class of 3, 9 Hit Dice, and claws that inflict ldB 
points of damage. It has a +2 bonus to its attack rolls with any 
weapon. 

Some wemics are able to use magic. There is a 70% chance that 
any tribe includes a witch doctor. Such wemics may attain a max¬ 
imum level of 7th-leve! priest and 4thdevei wizard. 

Mating occurs at any time of year. The female bears a litter of 
one to three cubs in ten months. The cubs are born with a camou¬ 
flage pattern of black spots: these fade within two months* 
Wemic cubs are playful and curious; they possess few instincts 
and thus must learn everything. Cubs are born with 1 HD and 
gain 2 HD each year. They reach maturity at age 3* 

Wemics have human-level intelligence. They possess a Stone 
age culture, using fire and possessing modest manufacturing 
skills with which they can create stone weaponry, pottery and 
ornaments. They can be taught more complex skills. They are 
excellent trackers and guides. They may hire out their services in 
exchange for treasure and tools, such as weapons and magical 
items. They may also charge travelers a toll for safe passage 
through their nation's territory. 

Ecology: Wemic cubs are worth 500 gp. They can be trained as 
servants or allies.

Whales are the largest sea mammals. They are highly intelligent 
creatures that occupy a number of ecological niches. The com¬ 
mon whales include plankton eaters like blue or hump-backed 
whales and carnivores like sperm whales, 

Common whales range in size from a 10-foot-long calf to 110- 
foot-long blue whales. The skin is normally blue-gray. Whales 
share a common language that is difficult for land creatures to 
learn since it uses tones below human hearing. 


Ecology: Although they are neutral in alignment toward hu¬ 
manoids, their alignment toward sea life is generally lawful 
good. With their great size, power, and diversity, they are Lhe 
masters of the sea. They preserve order through their conflicts 
with evilly inclined sea monsters. 

Unfortunately, their relations with seafarers are less certain, 
Because of the value placed on parts of the whale's body the crea¬ 
tures are hunted to excess by greedy whalers. Despite the hostib 



Combat: All common whales can attack with their tails, These 
can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the 
whale's Hit Dice. 

Plankton-feeding whales can attack with either of their flukes 
(fins). Whales of 12-17 HD cause Id8 points of damage, those of 
18-24 HD inflict 3d8 points, and those of 24-36 HD cause 5d8 
points. 

Carnivorous whales can bite. Whales of 12-17 HD inflict 5d4 
points of damage, those of 18-24 HD cause Id4xl0 points, and 
those of 24-36 HD inflict 3d4x5 points. 

Whales are vulnerable to surface ships only when the whales 
are on the surface. 


Habitat Society: Whales live in tribal gatherings called pods. 
They maintain strong personal and family ties. Their culture is 
based on complex songs that can be heard for miles underwater. 
Whales are curious about humanoids but if attacked they can be¬ 
come deadly foes. Whales rarely initiate combat . Whales are cu¬ 
rious about other intelligent beings. They welcome 
communication with other beings. They do not lie. but they may 
not reveaJ everything they know. 

Most whales teed on a variety of plankton, shrimp, and small 
fish that they suck up as they swim along. Sperm whales feed on 
larger fish, octopi, and especially giant squids. 

Whale cows normally give birth to a single calf. Twins occur in 
5% of births. The calf remains with the cow for the next five to 
ten years, depending on the species. After five years, the cow 
may give birth again, The calves are protected and taught by all 
members of the pod.

Whale 


ity of the humanoids, whales remain curious and basically 
friendly toward non-whaling seafarers. 

The carcass of a common whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. 
both for its meat and blubber. Whales possess a stinking, yellow 
mass called ambergris that is valuable for making perfumes; they 
vomit this tip when ilk The ambergris is worth ld20 x 1,000 gp. 

Giant Whale 

Giant whales are immense versions of sperm whales* 100' to 400' 
long. In the cetacean culture, they serve functions similar to 
knights or barons by protecting common whales against evil sea 
monsters and whalers. Giant whales are attended by 2d4 com- 
mon whales. 

Giant whales attack by biting or crushing. Whales of 18-25 HD 
inflict Id4xl0 points of damage, those of 26-35 HD cause 2d4xl0 
points, and those of 36-54 HD inflict 3d4xl0 points. The tail can 
deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the 
whale's Hit Dice. Giant whales can ram the sides of surface ships, 
delivering a crushing blow that, if successful sinks the ship. 
They can also leap halfway out of the water and fall onto a target 
vessel (50% chance of success). If successful, the ship is immedb 
ately driven under the surface. If a giant whale is facing an oppo¬ 
nent under 20 feet long, it can swallow the target intact on an 
attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit. 

Their stomachs contain large air chambers in which a victim 
might survive until he escapes or is digested. The stomach add is 
diluted by seawater; characters or objects trapped in the stomach 
gain a +1 bonus to saving throws vs. this acid, A swallowed 
character suffers 2 points of damage per round (1 if the saving 
throw is successful each round) from the add. The stomach 
might contain undigested possessions of previous meals. Each 
type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of 
being present in the giant whales gullet. There may be 1,000- 
3,000 coins of each type, ld20 gems, or ld4 magical items. 

The carcass of a giant whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The 
ambergris is worth 2d20 x 1,000 gp. 

Leviathan 

The leviathan is an almost unimaginably immense whale, 500 to 
1/000 feet long. It is the lord of all whales and the intermediary be¬ 
tween cetaceans and the gods. Under normal conditions, only one 
leviathan dwells in each ocean. The leviathan is not always active. It 
may hibernate for years on the ocean floor. During these long sleeps, 
the leviathan is attended and protected by its entourage of other 
whales. The leviathan awakens if summoned by the needs of other 
whales or in answer to a divine request. Leviathans are aw f esome 
foes with a variety of attacks. Their bite damage is determined by 
their Hit Dice. Leviathans of 24-35 HD inflict 3d4x5 points of dam¬ 
age, those of 36-47 HD cause 3d4xl0 points, and those of 45-72 HD 
inflict 3d4xi5 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that causes 
damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. On an attack roll that is 4 
or more greater than it needs to hit, a leviathan is capable of swal¬ 
lowing a target up to SO feet long. When attacking a mass of surface 
vessels, the leviathan creates a powerful wave by swimming deep, 
rushing to the surface, and leaping halfway out of the water. The 
resulting wave causes every ship within 500 feet to roll a saving 
throw vs. crushing blow and every ship within 500 to 2,000 feet to 
roll a saving throw vs, normal blow. Ships that fail a saving throw 
immediately sink. 

Once each century, leviathans gather in arctic waters to confer 
and to mate. This gathering lasts six months. Each leviathan is 
attended by 2dl0 giant whales and IGdlO whales of other species. 

The stomach of a leviathan contains air pockets that are capa¬ 
ble of sustaining a victim until he escapes or is digested. The 
stomach may also contain undigested possessions of previous 
meals or even sea vessels. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance 


per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's 
gullet. There may be 2,000-6,000 coins of each type, 5d20 gems, 
or IdS magical items. 

The carcass of a leviathan is worth 100 gp per Hit Die, The 
ambergris is worth 4d20 x 1,000 gp. However, the killing of a 
leviathan will result in every whale within that ocean converging 
on the killer to avenge their lords death, 

Killer Whale (Orcal 

The killer whale is one of the largest predatory sea mammals. It is 
a deadly killer able to hold its own against all but the most pow¬ 
erful sea monsters, A killer whale is likely to attack humanoids; 
it is capable of swallowing a man whole, should the need arise. 

Killer whales measure 15 to 30 feet long. Their black bodies are 
marked by a brilliant white belly and markings that vary from 
individual to individual 

Killer whales are not inherently hostile and do not attack un¬ 
less hungry or provoked. There is a 20% chance that encoun¬ 
tered killer whales are hungry. If they are communicated with 
rather than attacked, killer whales may prefer to talk rather than 
feed. 

The killer whale's diet consists of both fish and warm-blooded 
animals. It is a crafty hunter that can recognize the shadows and 
sounds made by animals atop ice floes* It will break through the 
ice to visually confirm the presence of prey. Smaller ice Hoes are 
rammed and shattered to force the prey into the water. When the 
killer whale smashes into the ice, every being on the ice must roll 
a saving throw vs. paralyzation, Failure means Lhe being has 
slipped into the water and can be attacked the following round. 

When a killer whale makes a successful hit, its prey is held In 
its jaws where it can automatically bite each round. Victims risk 
drowning in two to four rounds and lhe loss of 1 point of 
Strength and Dexterity per round, due to the numbing effect of 
the icy water. When either Strength or Dexterity reaches 0, the 
victim dies. 

The killer whale's main weapon is its terrible bite. Killer whales 
of 9-10 HD inflict 4d6 points of damage, while those of 11-12 HD 
cause 6d4 points. 

When hunting larger creatures, the pod acts together to bring 
down prey of up to 100 feet in length. 

Most pods consist only of adults, but 25% of encountered 
pods also have ldft calves (2-5 HD. swim 15, bite for 2d4). Adults 
defend their calves to the death. They also assist each other. 

Although killer whales prey on other whales, they also act as 
their protectors by battling other sea monsters that might deci¬ 
mate the entire cetacean family. Killer whales may enter into alli¬ 
ances with aquatic elves. 

The carcass of a killer whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The 
ambergris is worth ldl0 x 500 gp. 

Narwhal 

The narwhal is common to cold, subarctic waters. It is called the 
'"unicorn of the sea" because of the 6- to 12-foot-Iong spiral horn 
that the narwhal uses to dig into the sea floor for shellfish. If a 
narwhal is provoked, the horn can also be used like a lance to 
attack. When a narwhal attacks with its horn, its Hit Dice deter¬ 
mine the damage caused, A narwhal of 4 + 4 HD inflicts 2dl2 
points of damage, one of 5+5 HD causes 6d4 points, and one of 
6 + 6 HD inflicts 7d4 points. Only a male can develop this horn. 
A female attacks by ramming headfirst into its target, inflicting 
2d4 points of damage. 

Narwhals are basically peaceful creatures. They may serve as 
companions or guards for dolphins. They may also be trained 
and used by aquatic elves. 

The carcass of a narwhal is worth 1Q0 gp per Hit Die. The ivo¬ 
ry is worth Id4xl0 gp. The ambergris is worth Id10 x 200 gp.

In ages long past, the word wight" meant simply 'man" As the 
centuries have passed, though, it has come to be associated only 
with those undead that typically inhabit barrow mounds and cat¬ 
acombs. 

From a distance, wights can easily be mistaken for any number 
of humanoid races. Upon closer examination, however, their true 
nature becomes apparent. As undead creatures, wights are night¬ 
marish reflections of their former selves, with cruel, burning eyes 
set in mummified flesh over a twisted skeleton with hands that 
end in sharp daws. 

Combat: Wights are fierce and deadly foes in combat. When 
attacked, they are unharmed by any weapons that are not forged 
from silver or enchanted in some manner. 

The wight attacks with its jagged claws and powerful blows, in¬ 
flicting 1-4 points of damage with each successful strike. In addition 
to this physical harm, the wight is able to feed on the life essence of 
its foes. Each blow that the wight lands drains one level from the 
victim, reducing Hit Dice, class bonuses, spell abilities, and so forth. 
Thus, a 9th-Ievel wizard struck by a wight loses 1-4 hit points and 
becomes an 8th-levd wizard; he has the spells and hit points of an 
Sth-levei wizard and he fights as an 8th-level wizard. 

Persons who are slain by the energy draining powers of a 
wight are doomed to rise again as wights under the direct control 
of their slayer. In their new form, they have the powers and abili¬ 
ties of a normal wight but half their experience levels, class abili¬ 
ties, and Hit Dice. If the wight who "'created' 1 them is slain, they 
will instantly be freed of its control and gain a portion of its 
power, acquiring the normal 4+3 Hit Dice of their kind. Once a 
character becomes a wight, recovery is nearly impossible, requir¬ 
ing a special quest. 

Wights are unaffected by sleep, charm, hold or cold-based 
spells. In addition, they are not harmed by poisons or paralyza- 
Hon attacks. 

Wights can be engaged and defeated by individuals who are 
well prepared for battle with them. Physical contact with holy 
water is deadly to wights and each vial splashed on one bums it 



for 2-8 points of damage. In addition, a raise dead spell becomes 
a powerful weapon if used against the wight. Such magic is in¬ 
stantly fatal to the creature, utterly annihilating it. 

Wights cannot tolerate bright light, including sunlight, and 
avoid it at all costs. It is important to note, however, that wights 
are not harmed by exposure to sunlight as vampires are. 

Habitat/Society: Like the other undead that infest the world, 
wights live in barrow mounds, catacombs, and other sepulchral 
places. They despise light and places which are vibrant with liv¬ 
ing things. As a rule, the wight is hateful and evil, seeking to sat¬ 
isfy its hatred of life by killing all those it encounters. 

Although wights are often found in small groups, they are ac¬ 
tually solitary creatures. Without exception, encounters with 
multiple wights will be a single leader and a number of lesser 
creatures which it has created to serve it. In these cases, the leader 
of the group will be more than willing to sacrifice some or all of 
its minions to assure its own survival or victory. 

Ecology: Like all undead, wights exist on both the Prime Mate¬ 
rial and Negative Material planes simultaneously. It is this pow¬ 
erful link to the negative world that gives them their fearsome 
level-draining ability. Further, it is this draining which provides 
them with sustenance. 

As they are not living creatures and have no rightful place in 
our world, many animals can sense the wight s presence. Dogs 
will growl or howl with alarm, horses will refuse to enter an area 
which wights inhabit, and birds and insects will grow silent when 
the creature passes near them. In addition, their presence will 
gradually cause the plant life around their lairs to wither and die, 
marking the region as unclean.

The will o'wisp is a malevolent entity that makes its home in 
swamps, bogs, and moors. It subsists by luring unsuspecting 
creatures to their deaths amid the natural hazards of such places 
and feeding on the energies which their death struggles release. 

When encountered in the wild, will o'wisps normally appear as 
Faintly glowing balls of light. They can alter their own color, shape, 
and size to some extent and can be easily mistaken for lanterns, light 
spells, and similar sources of artificial Illumination. 

If they do not attack, will o'wisps are able to utterly blank out 
their glows, rendering them m visible to all those who cannot spot 
invisible objects, for 2-8 melee rounds. 

The will o'wisp language is a most unusual one. being purely 
optical in nature. All communication between will o'wisps is by 
means of changes in color or brightness, many of which are far 
too subtle for the average observer to notice. Because this form 
of exchange is almost impossible to mimic, it is very difficult for 
travelers to communicate with these creatures. Exceptional ex¬ 
amples of this race have mastered a very simple sound-based lan¬ 
guage, They produce sounds by vibrating very rapidly and thus 
have a shallow and ghostly-sounding voice when they “speak." 

Combat: As a rule, will o'wisps seek to avoid physical combat 
with other creatures, preferring to lead them to their deaths in the 
swamps around them instead. When pressed, however, they are 
dangerous adversaries who must be attacked with the greatest 
care. In combat, they glow blue, violet, or pale green. 

Will o'wisps are very versatile flyers. They can hover in place 
without effort, often looking like lanterns or similar beacons to 
lure others toward them. When they decide to move, they can do 
so with rapid bursts of speed or slow drifting movements. 

A will o wisp s main weapon in combat is its ability to manifest 
a powerful electric charge. In melee, it swoops at its foe and at¬ 
tempts to brush against the victim, discharging the stored energy, 
A successful strike by one of these creatures will cause 2-16 
points of damage. 

Those attacking a will o'wisp with any form of physical weap¬ 
on are able to inflict damage normally. Persons making use of 



magical attacks, however will find their powers almost ineffec¬ 
tive against them. As a rule, the only spells which have any effect 
on the will o'wisp are protection from evil rmgic missile, and 
maze. A will o'wisp which is reduced to 5 or fewer hit points 
will attempt to escape. If it is unable to flee, the creature will sur¬ 
render to its attackers and attempt to buy its safety by offering up 
any treasure which it may have. It is important to note, however, 
that the chaotic alignment of the will o'wisp can make any agree¬ 
ment with the creature uncertain. 

Habitat/Soriety: For the most part, will o'wisps will be found 
on their own. On rare occasions (10% of the time) groups of up 
to three may be found near a particularly fertile hunting ground. 
In the latter case, they will work together to trick victims into the 
traps which they have arranged. 

Ecology: Although difficult to say with certainty, evidence in¬ 
dicates that the will o'wisp feeds on the fury of electrical activity 
given off by the brains of panic stricken individuals as they real¬ 
ize that death is inescapable, In order to prolong the suffering of 
their victims and increase the amount of "food" which they give 
off, will o’wisps will typically lure their victims into areas like 
quicksand pits which promise a slow- and frightening death. 

Tt seems certain that the unusual environment found in bogs 
and swamps is important to the creature s existence in some way, 
but the exact nature of this link is uncertain. It seems probable 
that the ominous and haunting nature of these places increases 
the fear and dread which their victims feel, and thus the energy 
which they give off prior to death.

The wolf is a very active, tunning carnivore, capable of surviving in 
nearly every dimateH Shrouded in mystery and suspicion, they are 
viewed as vicious killers that slaughter men and animals alike for the lack 
of better things to do. The truth is that never in recorded history has a 
non-rabid or non-rficrmied wolf attacked any creature having an equal or 
higher intellect than itself, (The chance of encountering a rabid wolf that 
would attack anything is 1%, if a lone wolf is encounteredJ 

Northern wolves exhibit colors from pure white, to grey, to black. 
Southern wolves are reddish and brown in color. Although fur coloration 
vary with climate, all wolves have various features in common. They are 
characterized by power* yt jaws; wide strong teeth; bushy tails; tall, 
strong ears; and round pupils. Their eyes, a gold or amber color, seem to 
have an almost emptttkic ability. 


Winter Wolves 

The most dangerous member of the species, the winter wolf is known for 
its great size and foul disposition. Living only in chill regions, they can 
unleash a stream of frost from their lungs once every 10 rounds, causing 
od4 points of damage to everything within 10 feet. A save vs, breath 
weapon is allowed for half damage. Cold-based attacks to not harm the 
winter wolf, but fire-based attacks cause an additional point of damage, 
per die of damage. Winter wolves are more intelligent than their cousins 
and, in addition to being able to communicate with worgs, have a fairly 
sophisticated language of their own. The winter wolf is beautiful, with 
glistening white or silver fur and eyes of pale blue or silver, If in good 
condition, a pelt is worth 5.000 gold pieces. 



Combat; Wolves hunt in packs during winter and late fall when only 
large herbivores are available. Wolves prefer small prey over the larger 
variety, because of the amount of energy required to run them down. 
Even then, they catch only the weak and sickly animals. Wolves usually 
hunt only one large quarry per week, per pack, going without food for 
days at a time. During summer months, a single wolf can consume over 
30 mice in a single day, 

If a wolf or wolf pack is attacked by humans, they run away looking 
back momentarily to make sure they are not being followed. If backed 
into an inescapable location, they will attack by tearing at clothing or 
legs and arms until they have an opening to escape. 

Habitat Society: Wolves, like humans and demi-humans, are social ani¬ 
mals. They live, hunt and play in families. There is a very strict social 
structure in these iamily groups that is continually followed. Each pack is 
led by an alpha mak; his mate is the nlphn female. Only the alpha male 
and alpha female breed, but the second ranking female often helps in 
whelping and nursing duties. 

Wolves prefer areas not inhabited by other large predators. Their do¬ 
main has many terrain features in which they can play. Large rocks, fallen 
trees, and brooks play an important part in their recreational activities. 
Wolves will leave an area once humans move in. 

Ecology: Wolves are valuable hunters in the wild. Fear of the wolf has 
resulted in their extinction in many areas. This genocide results in a 
marked increase in rodenls and deer population that has nearly demol¬ 
ished the surrounding ecosystems. 

Dire Wolves 

The dire wolf is an ancestor of the modem species. Though larger in size, 
they are otherwise similar to their descendants. 


Woigf 

Worgs are an offshoot oi dire wolf stock that have attained a degree of 
intelligence and a tendency toward eviL Worgs have a primitive language 
and often serve as mounts of goblins,

The wolfwere is an evil and hateful creature that delights in the 
brutal slaying of humans and demihumans alike. In many cases, 
the wolfwere is able to attack its victims with utter surprise be¬ 
cause of Us ability to assume the shape of a human of exceptional 
charisma. 

The wolfwere is able to assume a wide variety of shapes at will. 
Transformation from one form to another takes only a single 
round Its true shape, and that in which it prefers to spend the 
vast majority of Us time, is that of a large wolf. When in this 
state, it is almost indistinguishable from a dire wolf. 

When a wolfwere is attempting to lure humans or demihumans 
into an ambush, it will assume the shape of member of their race. 
Almost without exception, the new persona will not be of the 
same sex as the potential victim, Thus, a wolfwere which is stalk¬ 
ing a male elf will transform itself into a female elf. In ail cases, 
the newly disguised wolfwere will have exceptional physical 
beauty, 

Combat: The wolfwere is a sly and dangerous adversary. In ad¬ 
dition to its great fury and fighting prowess, its high intelligence 
must not be overlooked or underestimated. 

When a wolfwere first spots unsuspecting humans or demL 
humans in its territory, it will change into its fully humanoid 
form and assume the guise of a pilgrim, minstrel, or similar wan¬ 
derer The wolfwere will normally carry some form of stringed 
instrument which it seems to absent-mindedly play at while it 
travels. The true nature of its song, however, is terrible and often 
fatal. Anyone who hears the wolfwere s song and then fails a sav¬ 
ing throve vs, spell will be overcome with lethargy. The effects of 
this enchantment are the same as those of the skw spell. Once 
this effect begins, it cannot be countered and lasts for 5-6 rounds. 

When a wolfwere is ready to attack, the creature again changes 
its shape. Now, in a form which is half-wolf and half-human (or 
demihuman • it strikes. The wolfwere will almost always change 
into this form when it engages in combat because it has the ability 
to bite like a wolf and also wield a weapon of some type. 

In any form but its fully humanoid one, the creature can deliv¬ 
er a savage bite with its powerful jaws. It is this mode of attack 
which the monster prefers to employ above all others. 



When in its humanoid or half-humartoid state, it is also able to 
carry and employ weapons. Although the exact type of weapon 
used will depend upon the specific tastes of the creature encoun¬ 
tered, wolfweres lend toward axes, swords, and similar cutting 
edges. 

If the creature is forced to engage in battle while in its human¬ 
oid form, it will be forced to rely wholly on its weapons for de¬ 
fense. In such cases, it normally seeks to escape and transform 
into its ha If-humanoid state before returning to battle. 

The magical nature of the wolfwere makes it immune to dam¬ 
age inflicted by any weapon which is not made from cold 
wrought iron or enchanted to +1 or better. All other weapons 
are simply turned aside by the creature's hide. 

It is possible to protect oneself from attacks by wolfweres, 
however, For they are disgusted by wolfsbane and will avoid it 
whenever possible. 

Habit.it.Society: The wolfwere is generally fairly solitary in na¬ 
ture. When encountered in the wild, it is rare that more than 
three of these creatures will be found. In almost all cases, en¬ 
counters with more than one wolfwere will be with a mated pair 
or a group which has decided to work together to increase the 
success of their hunting. 

Ecology: There is a 75% chance that any encountered wolfwere 
will be running with a pack of wild wolves. In such cases, the 
animals will be worgs 70% of the time. If they are not worgs, 
they will be common wolves. In all cases, the influence of the 
wolfwere will make the creaLures far more vicious and evil than 
they might normally be. 

Despite their fondness for wolves and worgs. wolfweres loathe 
the company of werewolves. The enmity between these two 
monsters is so great that they will often attack each other on 
sight.

Though they vary widely in size, all the worms in this listing 
have some common characteristics. They are all burrowers with 
long, cylindrical shapes. 

Purple Worm 

A constant threat to subterranean explorers, the purple worm 
burrows through the earth in search of prey. The worm is sensi¬ 
tive to minute vibrations in the earth, and can sense prey at a 
range of 60 feet. Adult purple worms as large as 8-9 feet in diame¬ 
ter and 140-150 feet long have been reliably reported. 

The worm attacks by biting; an attack roll that exceeds the re¬ 
quired score to hit by 4 or more indicates the victim has been 
swallowed whole. This worm can devour creatures up to 8 feet 
tall and 6 feet wide, A swallowed creature dies in six rounds, is 
digested in two hours, and cannot be raised from the dead. Any¬ 
one trapped inside a purple worm may attempt to cut their way 
out. The interior is AC 9, but digestive juices weaken the victim, 
causing a cumulative -1 penalty to the damage the victim can 
cause, This worn has a stinger on its tail. Anyone hit by the 
stinger suffers 2d4 points of damage and must make a successful 
saving throw vs. poison or be slain instantly. 

The purple worm is solitary and seeks a companion only to 
mate. The moment a new worm hatches, it burrows into the 
ground, never to be seen by its siblings again. As the worm tun¬ 
nels, it consumes vast amounts of material that are excreted 
when it returns to its lair. Among the discharged substances are 
precious metals and gems. 

The mottled worm is an aquatic variety of the purple worm. It 
inhabits shallow bottom muck, but it often surfaces to search for 
prey. Otherwise, it is the same as a purple worm. 

The thunderherder is desert variety of the purple worm; they 
travel in herds of 10-100, several feet under the sands. They feed 
on small creatures in the sand, their bodies ejecting sand. They 
are 3-5 feet in diameter and 5-10 feet long, and have 7 Hit Dice. 
Their mouths are unable to cause damage, but their passage be¬ 
neath an area causes an earthquake-like effect. 

Giant Bloodworm 

These worms are mottled green in color, with a dark, slimy, 
brown underbelly* A giant bloodworm attacks when hungry or 
when stepped on, by trying to fasten its mouth to its victim. If it 
hits, it causes 1 d8 damage, and continues to cause ld8 damage 


per round from blood drain, until killed or removed (removal 
requires a successful open doors roll). 

These worms are especially vulnerable to fire, taking double 
normal damage from such attacks, or full damage when they 
make a successful saving throw despite a ~2 penalty to the roll. 

Bookworm 

This worm can change its normal gray color to match its sur¬ 
roundings; opponents suffer a -6 to surprise rolls. Bookworms 
inhabit libraries, eating through the pages and bindings found 
there. They cannot eat living matter, but they will burrow 
through dead wood, leather, and other normal book materials al 
a rate of 3 inches per round. They are very fast and seek to avoid 
capture and combat when discovered. 

Rot Grub 

These maggot-like creatures live in refuse* If they touch exposed 
skin (they have a percentage chance to do this equal to the vic¬ 
tim's AC, not counting shield), they burrow into the flesh and 
secrete a mild poison that deadens the burrowing area; a victim 
must make a successful Wisdom check to notice the burrowing; 
one check is allowed each round* Fire kills 2dl0 grubs per appli¬ 
cation to infested flesh, but after ld6 rounds they are too deep to 
be burned. A cure disease will kill the rot grubs. If the worms are 
not stopped, they reach the heart in ld3 turns, killing the victim.

The wraith is an evil undead spirit of a powerful human that 
seeks to absorb human life energy. 

These horrible creatures are usually seen as black, vaguely 
man-shaped clouds. They have no true substance, but tend to 
shape themselves with two upper limbs, a torso, and a head with 
two glowing red eves This shape is a convenience born from the 
habit of once having a human body. 

Combat: The touch of a wraith does damage in two ways. 
First, the chilling effect of the touch inflicts 1-6 points of damage, 
even to creatures immune to cold. Second, such a hit drains a 
level of experience from its victim. This includes hit points and 
all abilities associated with that level, such as spell casting or 
combat ability. The damage from the chill can be healed normal¬ 
ly, but the experience points are gone forever and must be earned 
again or magically restored. 

Wraiths are immune to normal weapons. An attack with such 
a weapon merely passes through its body with no effect, Silver 
weapons cause only half normal damage. Magical weapons in¬ 
flict their full damage, causing a black vapor to boil away from 
the body of the wraith, A wraith slowly regains its full hit points 
if left alone for at least a week (recovering one point every eight 
hours). Like most undead, wraiths are immune to sleep, charm , 
hold, death and cold-based spells. They are immune to poison 
and paralyzation* A vial of holy water causes 2-8 points of dam¬ 
age (as arid) upon striking the body of a wraith, A raise dead 
spell will utterly destroy one if a saving throw vs. spell is failed. 

Wraiths attack humans or demihumans in preference to other 
creatures. However, animals will sense their presence within 30 
feet and refuse to advance further, panicking if forced. A pack of 
wraiths will try to get surprise when attacking, and will wait and 
position themselves for the most advantageous moment to at¬ 
tack. Wraiths are very intelligent and tend to cluster around the 
weaker members, or stragglers, when attacking. Any human 
killed by a wraith becomes a half-strength wraith under its con¬ 
trol (e.g,, a lOth-level fighter will become a 5 Hit Die wraith un¬ 
der the control of the wraith that slew Kim). 

This foul creature has no power in direct sunlight and will flee 



from it. Sunlight cannot destroy the wraith, but the undead crea¬ 
ture cannot attack in sunlight. It shuns bright (e.g., continue?/) 
light sources in general, but will occasionally attack if the com¬ 
pulsion to do so is strong. 

Habitat'Sodety: A wraith is an undead spirit of a powerful, 
evil human. As such, it is usually found in tombs or places where 
such men and women would have died. Since such men and 
women are frequently buried together, in the case of the wealthy, 
or with their families, wraiths are most commonly encountered 
in packs. Those that died or were buried alone might still be en¬ 
countered in packs, because a human who dies from the touch of 
a wraith becomes a wraith under the sway of its slayer. The trea¬ 
sure of the wraith is usually its possessions in life, now buried 
with it, or those of its victims. Wraiths exist only to perpetuate 
evil by absorbing the life force of as many people as possible, A 
character who becomes a wraith is nearly impossible to recover, 
requiring a special quest. 

The wraith cannot communicate, except through a speak with 
dead spell. They do not even seem to communicate with each 
other, except as master to slave for combat strategy. Any attempt 
to speak to a wraith is met with scorn, unless by a very powerful 
party. In that case, the wraith desires only to flee. Wraiths can be 
dominated by powerful evil creatures, particularly other undead, 
priests, and wizards, and made to serve their will. 

Ecology: The wraith has no proper niche, serving no useful 
purpose in nature and providing no byproducts that others can 
use. It requires no nourishment, killing only for the sheer hatred 
of life. All creatures close to nature will shun the presence of a 
wraith. It exists more in the Negative Material plane than in the 
Prime Material plane, and thus is not a natural part of this world.

A distant cousin to the dragon, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard 
with a poisonous stinger in its tail 

The 35-ioot-long dark brown to gray body of the wyvern is 
half tail. Its leathery batlike wings are over 50 feet from tip to tip. 
The head alone is 4 feet long and filled with long, sharp teeth. 
Unlike the dragon, it has only hind legs, using them the same way 
a hunting bird would The tip of the tail is a thick knot of carti¬ 
lage from which a 2- foot-long stinger protrudes, very much like 
that of a scorpion. The eyes are red or orange. A wyvern does 
not have a strong odor, although its lair might smell of a recent 
kill. These beasts can make two sounds; a loud hiss, which 
sounds like a hot sword plunged into water, and a low, deep- 
throated growl, much like that of a bull crocodile. 

Combat: Rather stupid, buL aggressive, wyvems will nearly al¬ 
ways attack. In combat, the wyvern always prefers to be flying, 
and will seize any opportunity to take flight and continue com¬ 
bat. If trapped on the ground it will bite (2-16 points of damage) 
and use its stinger (1-6 points of damage), attacking the most 
convenient target or targets. The lad is very mobile, easily strik¬ 
ing over the back of the wyvern to hit an opponent to its front. 
The stinger injects poison (type F) into the wound, against which 
the victim must make a save vs. poison or die. Even if the saving 
throw is successful, the victim suffers 1-6 points of physical dam¬ 
age from the sting. 

From the air the wyvern is a far more deadly opponent. It dives 
upon ground targets, attempting to snatch them up in its two tal- 
oned daws (1-6 points of damage each) and fly off. Man-sized 
victims are snatched if at least one talon hits for damage. Large 
victims require both talons to hit in order to snatch them up. The 
wyvern cannot fly while carrying anything bigger. After a dive, 
it takes the wyvern a full round to circle around. On the next 
round it can dive again. Once airborne with prey in its talons, the 
wyvern stings and bites each round, both at +4 to hit, until the 
victim is motionless. In aerial combat, the wyvern will make a 
pass during which it will either bite or sting. Then it will land and 
feast, not hunting again until the next day. 

As a hunter, the wyvern is cunning. It will avoid letting its 
shadow fall across its prey as a w T aming. The final approach of 



the dive is done in complete silence, imposing a -2 surprise modi¬ 
fier on the target. It trails its prey from downwind whenever pos¬ 
sible. A mature wyvern often waits for the right moment to 
strike, and is willing to let prey go that is too powerful or within 
easy reach of cover. Such a wyvern understands that men, partic¬ 
ularly those armed in bright metal, are stronger than their size 
would indicate. Given a perfect opportunity, it will attempt to 
snatch up an unarmored member and fly out of range. 

Habitat/Sodety: The wyvern is a solitary creature, nesting only 
with its mate and young. It tends to lair on mountainsides that 
overlook forests, jungles, or sometimes plains. A wyvem makes 
its lair in large caverns that can be found in such places, staking 
out a territory about 25 miles across. If game is sparse, it will 
hunt with a small group of its own kind. Only young wyverns 
attack others of their kind, usually to establish new territory. 
Older wyverns settle disputes in an unknown manner without 
actual combat. 

Some wyvems have been known to work with evil dragons. 
Usually these dragons completely dominate the weaker and 
smaller wyverns. 

Ecology: An adult wyvern consumes the equivalent of a man- 
sized to large creature once per day. This could translate to a 
horse, pig, or a handful of sheep. While it eats them whole the 
bones are not digested, and neither are metal objects, The 
wyvern eats carrion only if desperate. 

The wyvern has no natural enemies, although it would not be 
a match for certain powerful creatures. It is noted for the foul 
taste of its flesh. No one has found a way to cure its hide and the 
bones are light and brittle to aid in flying. Certain body parts are 
used by spell casters as spell components, for which they will pay 
a reasonable price.

The xom (zom) are natives to the elemental plane of Earth, 

The wide body of a xorn is made of a pebbly, stone-like material. It 
has a large, powerful mouth on top of its head with three long arms, 
tipped with sharp talons, symmetrically positioned every' 120 degrees 
around it. Between the arms are large, stone-lidded eyes that see in all 
directions. At its base are three thick, short legs, each directly beneath an 
eye. The whole body is designed for burrowing, mouth first. 

Combat: Xorn do not attack flesh creatures except to defend them- 
selves or their property, since they can not digest flesh, Xorn have no 
excessive love or hate for creatures of the Prime Material plane. The 
sole exception to this is anyone carrying a significant amount of pre¬ 
cious metals or minerals, which it can smell up to 20 feet away. The 
normally peaceful xom can become quite aggressive when after food, 
especially on the Prime Material plane, where such sustenance is 
harder to find than it is on its native plane. Xom expect to be given a 
reasonable portion in exchange for peaceful passage, or else they at¬ 
tack (90% chance) to get food. 

In combat, xom have two different methods of fighting. Against a sin¬ 
gle opponent, they bend the two legs nearest the opponent deeply, an¬ 
gling their bodies toward the enemy. In this way all four attacks can be 
brought to bear. Against several opponents, they attack with arms in all 
directions, each striking at a different target. One of the targets suffers a 
second attack, as the xom angles its body down to bite. 

If necessary, a xom can use its ability to blend into the surrounding 
stone to impose a —5 penalty to opponents surprise rolls when it 
attacks. This incorporates a blending of coloration and its physical 
ability to pass into and through stone. This does not happen very 
often, since a xorn is more likely to ignore a party, or openly demand 
metals. However once combat begins, it can use a variation on this 
theme. The xom may pass through the nearest stone (usually the 
floor) and vanish for 1-3 rounds, It then lunges out of a stone surface 
to gain surprise, often at the feet of an opponent, attacking with three 
arms and its mouth. This guerrilla warfare can continue indefinitely. 
During any round that it passes through stone, a phase door spell 
kills it instantly. If fight goes against it, the xom retreats to the near¬ 
est stone surface. 

A xom is immune to fire and cold, both magical and normal. Elec¬ 
trical attacks cause half damage if the xorn fails its saving throw, and 
no damage if the saving throw is successful. Edged weapons cause 
only half damage to xom. though blunt and piercing weapons do full 
damage. A move earth spell flings a xorn back 30 ieet, and the crea¬ 
ture is stunned for one round A stone to flesh or rode to mud spell 
lowers its AC to 8 for one round. During that round the xom will 



attack, as it is readjusting its substance back to stone. Lastly, a 
pusswatl spell inflicts Idl0 + 1Q points of damage on a xom. 

Habitat Society: A xom is normally found on the elemental plane of 
Earth, It is only on the Prime Material plane if forcibly summoned or 
if it was the victim of an interplanar accident. 

On their native plane, xom are as peaceful as Prime Material plane 
herbivores. While xorn are intelligent, their society is limited to small 
clans of mineral gatherers. These dans wander from place to place, 
leaving behind open pockets where they have eaten out a vein of 
mineral. On the Prime Material plane they always seek wide regions 
of stone underground, What humans would consider treasures, xom 
consider food. They keep their store of food in a nearby air pockets. 

Ecology? On the Prime Material plane, they are visitors that serve no 
ecological function. On their own plane, they are gatherers, eating 
only stone and minerals. The empty pockets in the stone are quickly 
inhabited by various creatures of the plane, Dao have been known to 
hunt them for sport. Equally as often, xom serve dao as slaves. 

Xaren 

Xaren are relatives of the xom f with identical abilities in combat. 
Xaren resemble xorn closely, though they are slightly smaller and 
their hides are shinier, almost metallic. Unlike ordinary xom, they 
crave magical metal as food. For each plus of enchantment they eat, 
they permanently gain I hit point, up to their maximum of 45. Even 
after reaching their maximum growth, they still require magical 
metal to maintain their health. They can smell magical metal up to 40 
feet away. 

Like xorn, xaren expect handouts. They demand magical metal 
from creatures with enchanted weapons or armor, and attack if they 
are denied. They prefer iron, copper, silver, gold and electrum (in 
that order), though they will also snack on metallic ore. 

It attacked with a magical weapon, xaren can make an attack roll 
against AC —2 to bite an opponent s weapon. If they hit. the weapon 
must save vs. crushing blow or be destroyed, 

Xaren and xom are indifferent to one another and rarely cooper¬ 
ate, Dao do not enslave xaren, though they do hunt them.

Sometimes confused with the abominable snowman t the yeti is a 
distant cousin to the great carnivorous apes of warmer climates. 

An adult yeti stands 8 feet tall and is covered in long, white fur. 
Their feet and hands are wide and flat, which helps to disperse 
their great weight (about 300 pounds) on treacherous snow 
fields. They travel on all fours like the apes, but fight very com¬ 
fortably standing erect. Unlike most apes and gorillas, the yeti 
does not have an opposable toe on its feet. They wear no clothing 
or ornamentation. The spoor, or smell, of a yeti is very subtle in 
cold climates, but in confined or warm areas, they have a strong, 
musky odor. The eyes of a yeti are icy blue or almost colorless, 
Their claws and flesh are ivory white. Unlike many arctic crea¬ 
tures, the yeti does not have a thick layer of body fat to keep it 
warm. Instead, it relies upon the special properties of its thick, 
warm fur. It has a transparent second eyelid, which allows the 
creature to see in blowing snow, and prevents its eyes from freez¬ 
ing in extreme temperatures. 

Combat: The yeti is a fierce hunter of the polar regions. It stalks 
its prey and lays an ambush, attempting to gain surprise. A fa¬ 
vorite trick is to get ahead of its prey and lie in a depression in the 
snow, or dig a shallow pit and cover itself with snow. Such 
works can be detected only by natives of the arctic regions, and 
then only 25% of the time. Against the snow, the yeti is invisible 
due to its coloration until its prey is 10 yards away. Under a thin 
layer of snow' it is completely invisible, 

Any opponent surprised by a yeti must save vs. paralyzation 
or go rigid with fright for three rounds, indicating that he has 
looked into the icy blue depths of the yet i s eyes. Any opponent 
that is paralyzed in this way can be automatically hit by both 
daws and squeezed. 

Although the yeti does have fangs (1-4 points of damage), it 
does not usually attack with them, preferring to use its formida¬ 
ble claws, If any hit with daws is made with a natural 20, the 
victim is pulled in for a chilling squeeze, The creature's fur actu¬ 
ally absorbs heat, making it extraordinarily cold if contacted (2- 
16 points of damage if squeezed). The heat-absorbing property of 
the yetis fur can work against it: damage from heat is 50% 
greater than normal. 



Habita ^Society: Although the yeti is of average intelligence, it 
has no civilization. They can use simple tools, including man¬ 
made weapons, but will not make any themselves. Yeti live in ice 
caves in hills and mountains. Sometimes these are natural, some¬ 
times they are excavated by the yeti or enlarged to accommodate 
the family. Most yeti treasure consists of Items recovered from 
the bodies of explorers. 

Life is harsh in the arctic, and friends and food ate hard to find, 
making survival and reproduction the yeti's only goals. The yeti 
will associate only with its immediate family, the young leaving 
to fend for themselves as soon as they mature. A family usually 
consists of an adult male with one to three females and a 50% 
chance of 1-6 young if females are present. In an attacking group, 
the largest yeti is the male, the next largest ones are his mates. 
Any others are small males or females that are due to leave the 
family soon. 

Ecology: Any living creature not of its family is considered po¬ 
tential food, including other yeti. This does not make them fool¬ 
hardy: only a starving yeti will attack an obviously stronger 
party Their typical diet consists of herd creatures, such as cari¬ 
bou, bears, wolves, and other creatures inhabiting the snowy 
mountains in which they live. The yeti may turn to scavenging in 
hard times. They range across a wide area in search of food, usu^ 
ally 15 miles in all directions from their lair. 

Yeti daws and teeth have value only because of the rarity of 
the creature. They sell for about a gold piece a tooth or claw on 
the open market. Yeti fur is another story. It is prized by those 
living in cold climates for its extraordinary ability to keep its 
wearer warm, A full grown yeti pelt can fetch up to 300 gold 
pieces on the open market.

Descendants of humans whose blood has been fouled, yuan-ti have 
varying degrees of snake!ike body parts. They are highly Intelligent 
and evil, always plotting to advance their causes. 

There are three major varieties of yuan-ti: pwreh/ood!s r halfbreeds, 
and abominations. A pureblood can pass for human 80% of the time. 
It has only slight differences from true humans, such as slit eyes, or a 
forked tongue, maybe even small fangs. Halfbreeds are part human 
and part snake. Roll a d6 twice on the table below: a duplicate roll 
produces no result, but is not rerolled. Ignore unworkable combina¬

Abominations are either all snake (50%) or have only a single human 
feature, either head or arms, and are of large size (10 feet long). 
Halfbreeds and abominations disdain wearing human clothing or armor, 
while purebloods do not , All yuan-ti use weapons and other items. Yuan- 
ti do not give off an odor that humans can detect, However, animals will 
detect a dry. musty smell on them. The snake features of these foul crea¬ 
tures vary greatly from simple green and brown scales to wild patterns of 
stripes, diamonds, and whorls In reds and blues. Yuan-ti speak their own 
language. They can also speak with any snake or snakelike creature. 
Those with human heads speak common besides. 



Combat: Yuan-ti are geniuses, and fight as such. They plan elabo¬ 
rate traps and utilize their surroundings superbly in combat. They 
prefer ambushes to direct confrontation. In a mixed group, the least 
valuable and powerful attack the opponent first. This means that the 
purebloods go before the half-breeds, which go before the abomina¬ 
tions. The group leader may order particular members forward be¬ 
fore others if it provides for a better strategy. When encountered 
outside their temple area, only one to four of them are in a group. In 
the temple area they can be found in much larger groups. 

Purebloods have 6 Hit Dice, half-breeds have 7 or 8 Hit Dice, and 
abominations have 9 Hit Dice. All yuan-ti, if they have hands, al¬ 
ways use weapons, preferring those with an edge. They use poison, 
particularly slow acting types, but in traps, not on weapons. 

Any yuan-ti with a human head can cast the following spells once 
per day; cause fear darkness £15 foot radius), snake charm, sticks to 
snake s, neutralize poison, suggestion, and polymoq^h other 

Habitat/Society; Yuan-ti are devout worshippers of evil. They also 
hold all reptiles in high esteem, The center of yuan-ti life is the tem¬ 
ple. They tend toward old ruins far away from man, but have even 
been known to build underneath human cities. Their own works tend 
toward circles, with ramps and poles replacing stairs. In all cases they 
are secretive about the location of their city or temple. The abomina¬ 
tions rule over the yuan-ti, and are the leaders of the temple, with the 
high priest (human-headed) ruling over all. Their rituals often in¬ 
volve bloody sacrifices. The purebloods take care of all outside nego¬ 
tiations, always pretending to be human. Yuan-ti speak their own 
language and common. 

Ecology: Ages ago, a cult of humans worshiping a reptilian elder 
god recieveda ' blessing ' from their dark lord: their offspring all were 
part snake. Since then the breeding line has been polluted and mixed, 
producing purebloods (those least favored), half-breeds, and abomi¬ 
nations {the truly blessed). They are strictly carnivorous, eating any 
warm-blooded creature they can catch. They have a special taste for 
birds and human flesh. They are clever enough about their ecology 
not to overturnt any particular region. Larger groups keep captive 
herds of wingless birds or other warm-blooded creatures.

Once human, yuan-ti histachii are near-mindless abominations 
who have been transformed into reptilian humanoids to serve 
their yuan-ti masters. Most often, they are found guarding yuan- 
ti brood chambers. 

Histachii are hairless creatures. Their clothing, little more than 
filthy rags, hangs limply over their emaciated bodies. Their gray 
or yellow-green skin is tough and scaly, and smells faintly of rot¬ 
ting meat. They have beady bloodshot eyes, and their forked 
tongues continually dart in and out of their mouths. Their dull 
yellow teeth are like tiny hooks, razor-sharp. Their fingernails 
are black and twisted, resembling the claws of a lizard. 

Histachii speak in short, hissing phrases. They know the lan¬ 
guages of yuan-ti and all snakes and snakdike creatures, as well 
as the languages they spoke in their original human lives. 

Combat: Histachii attack any nonreptilian creature or humanoid 
on sight, unless their yuan-ti masters give them orders to the con¬ 
trary. Unsophisticated fighters, most histachii charge directly at 
their opponents, attacking with their claws and teeth, To protect 
their yuan-ti masters, histachii will fight to the death. 

Regardless of their abilities in their former lives, histachii do 
not wield weapons or use magic. Once per day they can become 
berserk. In this state, they are so enraged that they gain a +2 
bonus to their attack rolls. The berserk condition persists for 2-12 
(2d6) rounds. 

Unlike yuan-ti, histachii have no natural magic resistance. 
However, they are immune to all types of hold and charm spells. 

Habitat Society: Yuan-ti create most histachii servitors from hu¬ 
man prisoners. They also may transform human worshippers 
who voluntarily agree to become histachii. Humans become his¬ 
tachii by drinking a distillation of yuan-ti venom mixed with cer¬ 
tain herbs and roots. (The yuan-ti prepare this special 
concoction.) If a human is unwilling to drink, the yuan-ti pin 
their captive to the ground and pour the mixture down his 
throat. 

Any human who drinks this mixture, whether by choice or by 
force, must make a saving throw vs. poison with a -4 penalty. If 
the saving throw fails, the victim becomes a histachii in 7-12 
(ld6 + 6) days. If the save is successful, the victim immediately 
lapses into a coma: death will Follow in one hour, A comatose 
victim can be revived with a s/ou? pofson or neutralize poison 
spell, presuming the spell is cast within 1 hour after the mixture 



has been swallowed. Human-headed yuan-ti have the ability to 
neutralize poison, and they may save a comatose victim them¬ 
selves, It is not for the victim's benefit. A human who fails his 
save after drinking the mixture may suddenly find himself alive 
again, only to face another flask of the mixture when the yuan-ti 
attempt another transformation. 

Only humans can become histachii. Nonhumans who drink 
the yuan-ti mixture must also make a save vs. poison with a “4 
penalty, however, if the save is successful, the nonhuman will be 
violently ill, unable to take any action for 1-4 turns. If the save 
throw fails, the nonhuman becomes comatose and dies in 2-5 
rounds. 

If a human falls his saving throw after consuming the mixture, 
a few desperate measures may prevent his transformation into a 
histachii. If neutralize poison, dispel magic , remove curse , and 
heal are cast on the victim, in precisely this order, the transfor¬ 
mation process will be reversed. However, the victim will perma¬ 
nently lose 1 point of Intelligence. A wish or a limited wish will 
reverse the transformation with no loss of Intelligence. Once the 
transformation is complete, only a wish can restore the victim to 
his former self. Histachij live 20-60 (2dS x 10) years after their 
creation. They cannot breed: histachii only can be created from 
human beings. 

Histachii are completely submissive to their yuan-ti masters, 
carrying out their every order without hesitation. The servants 
share the lairs of their yuan-ti masters. Usually, these lairs are in 
ancient ruins deep in tropical jungles, but sometimes yuan-ti 
dwell in subterranean caverns beneath human cities. A histachifs 
duties include hunting, caring for the yuan-ti's reptile menag¬ 
eries, guarding prisoners, and various custodial chores. In rare 
moments of leisure, the servants enjoy soaking in pools of cool 
water. Histachii do not collect treasure. 

Ecology: Like yuan-ti, histachii are strictly carnivorous, feasting 
on rats, worms, and other vermin. They also eat yuan-ti left¬ 
overs.

These yugoloths are summoned by evil wizards or priests to 
guard something of importance. Yugoloth guardians always de¬ 
fend their charge with great l-erocity. 

There are three types of yugoloth guardians—least, lessen and 
greater. The least and lesser yugoloth guardians vary in size ami 
form, often being homed and frog-like (least) or ape- or boar-like 
(lesser), Greater yugoloth guardians always appear as gigantic, 
winged bears with ram horns protruding from their foreheads, 
and eagle talons for hands. 

yugoloths guardian have the ability to speak all languages. 

Combat: yugoloth guardians can breath fire three times per day 
in a cone 3D feet long with a 10-foot base diameter, Damage de¬ 
pends upon the type of daemon breathing. Least and lesser yugo¬ 
loths cause 3do and 5d6 points of damage, respectively, while 
greater yugoloths inflict 7d6 points per breath attack. A success¬ 
ful saving throw vs. breath weapon reduces damage by half. 
Yugoloth guardians never use their fire breath if the Hre might 
damage whatever they are assigned to protect. 

All yugoloth guardians are immune to charm, hold, sleep , 
polymorph, and fear spells. Lesser and greater yugoloths are also 
impervious to weapons with less than a +2 bonus. Many of these 
creatures are invulnerable to one or more additional forms of at¬ 
tack (e.g., sword, cold, fire, electricity). 

Habitat Society: Yugoloth guardians must remain at all times 
within 90 yards of the object they have been summoned to pro¬ 
tect. Within this 90-yard radius, yugoloth guardians prefer to re¬ 
main at a distance in battle, using their breath weapon to 
maximum advantage. 

Ecology: Summoning a guardian daemon is a dangerous affair. 
There is a 10% chance for each level the summoner is over 7th 
level of having his request for a guardian daemon granted (maxi¬ 
mum chance of 90%). Conversely if the summoning fails, there 
is a 30% chance (-2% per level of the summoner over 10tht that 
the daemon takes offense and gates in to slay the spellcaster 

Least Yugoloth 

These creatures are often summoned to protect treasures valued 
at less than 25,000 gold pieces. Least yugoloths have a 50% 
chance of being immune to one additional type of attack. 


Lesser Yugoloth 

Lesser yugoloths are usually found guarding treasures of 25,000 
gold pieces or more. They have a 80% chance of being impervi¬ 
ous to one additional attack form. 

Greater Yugoloth 

These yugoloths are dispatched only to protect objects of exceed¬ 
ingly great value. Greater yugoloth guardians are resistant to 
magic (25%) and are always immune to two additional forms of 
attack. They can make a suggestion, as the spell, once per round, 
even when engaged in combat,

The zaratan is an enormous, passive turtle found in the warm 
currents of Zakharas seas, in the Al-Qadim campaign setting. 
Thankfully the zaratan spends most of its existence in a pro¬ 
foundly deep slumber. 

The shell of a zaratan (plural, zaratani) looks like a sloped, 
rocky mound several hundred feet in diameter The zaratan's 
head, over 50 feet across, is often mistaken for a partially- 
submerged, bamacle-encrus ted boulder. The zaratan usually 
keeps its eyes shut, covered with stony lids that blend with the 
rest of its head in texture and color. The zaratan's four flippers, 
each over a hundred feet long, appear to be small reefs, support¬ 
ing a variety of corals, barnacles, and small fish. The zaratans 
rocky shell is considered AC —6, while its head and flippers are 
only AC 0. In its dormant state, a zaratan appears to be a small, 
floating island. 


Combat; More often than not, once wakened from its slumber, a 
zaratan wilt react to an enemy by withdrawing into its rocklike 
shell, against which nonmagical weapons have absolutely no ef¬ 
fect. In addition, no known poison will effect a zaratan with its 
incredibly slow metabolism. A zaratan will remain in its shell for 
1-10 years (if not further provoked) before re-emerging. 

However, if pestered and wounded for more than 5% of its 
total hit points, a zaratan becomes a terrible opponent. Although 
it attacks last in every round, a single bite from its 40' maw deliv¬ 
ers 10-100 points of damage and will swallow any beings within a 
10' radius of its target (no save), should its attack roll succeed by 
4 more than needed. 

The stomach of a zaratan is a tough, tube-shaped cave. Usu¬ 
ally there is enough stale, trapped air for a creature to survive 
indefinitely {if they survived the bite attack), but creatures 
trapped within also suffer 2 points of damage per day unless they 
can figure out a way to protect themselves from the stomachs 
corrosive digestive juices. The stomach lining is AC 5. Damage 
equal to 5% of the zaratans total hit points (a case of painful 
indigestion) will result in the victims regurgitation. A zaratan s 
stomach might contain just about any tiling, depending upon the 
whim of the DM, from pieces of driftwood and chunks of ships, 
to weapons, armor, and even a small amount of treasure (sug¬ 
gested type Z). 

After a battle, a zaratan will immediately fall into a deep slum¬ 
ber, which typically lasts 1-100 years. 



Habitat/Society; The slow metabolism of the zaratani assure 
them incredibly long (if uneventful) lives, measured in millennia. 
The zaratani are said to have been floating in the sea long before 
the genies first visited the Land of Fate, 

At any given time, a zaratan is 99% likely to be sleeping. As it 
slumbers, it keeps its mouth wide open. Any small to mart-sized 
creatures stupid enough to swim inside (large fish mostly) are re¬ 
flex ively swallowed. The zaratan spends the rest of its time either 
mating or conversing with others of its own kind. 

Every few centuries, by sheer coincidence, a pair of zaratani 
will drift into each other. Should they awake (and be of the oppo¬ 
site sex), they will mate. The courtship ritual may take decades, 
and the mating itself lasts as long as a year. 

The zaratani communicate with one another in a language sim¬ 
ilar to that of the whales. Conversations between the zaratani 
often last decades. On rare occasions, they have been known to 
communicate with other beings via telepathy. 

Ecology; The older a zaratan gets,, the longer it sleeps. As a re¬ 
sult, many actually become indistinguishable from a floating is¬ 
land or reef, supporting their own mini-ecosystems on their 
broad, rocky carapaces and underbellies. Many sport stunted 
palm trees and vegetation on their shells* 

The older and wiser zaratani are perfectly content to be attend¬ 
ed by lesser symbiotic beings, provided the symbiotes are not too 
bothersome and don't interfere with a zaratan s sleep. A few are 
known to support small, uncivilized villages, while others have 
even been used as a mobile base for pirates and corsairs! 

Visitors will find most inhabitants of a zaratan highly supersti¬ 
tious. Many revere their island home as a god. They believe 
(rightly) that were their deity to awaken due to hunger, their is¬ 
land might sink beneath the sea, destroying their village. As a 
result, these villagers strive at every opportunity to keep the 
zaratan well-fed and content, sacrificing large quantities of 
caught fish and even visitors to placate their floating deity

Zombies are mindless, animated corpses controlled by their crea¬ 
tors, usually evil wizards or priests. The condition of the corpse 
is not changed by the animating spell. If the body was missing a 
limb, the zombie created from it would be missing the same limb. 
Since it is difficult to get fresh bodies, most zombies are in sorry 
shape, usually missing hair and flesh, and sometimes even bones. 
This affects their movement, making it jerky and uneven. Usu¬ 
ally zombies wear the clothing they died (or were buried) in. The 
rotting stench from a zombie might be noticeable up to 100 feet 
away, depending upon the condition of the body. Zombies can¬ 
not talk, being mindless, but have been known to utter a low 
moan when unable to complete an assigned task. 

Combat: Zombies move very slowly, always striking last in a 
combat round* They are given only simple, single-phrase com¬ 
mands. They always fight until called off or destroyed, and noth¬ 
ing short of a priest can turn them back* They move in a straight 
line toward their opponents, with arms out-stretched, seeking to 
daw or pummel their victims to death. Like most undead, zom¬ 
bies are immune to steep, charm, hold, death magic , poisons, 
and cold-based spells, A vial of holy water inflicts 2-8 points of 
damage to a zombie* 

Habitat Sodetyr Zombies are typically found near graveyards, 
dungeons, and similar charnel places. They follow the spoken 
commands of their creator, as given on the spot or previously, of 
limited length and uncomplicated meaning (a dozen simple 
words or so). The dead body of any humanoid creature can be 
made into a zombie. 

Ecology: Zombies are not natural creations and have no role in 
ecology or nature. 

Ju-Ju Zombie 

These creatures are made when a wizard drains the life force 
from a man-sized humanoid creature with an energy drain spell. 
Their skin is hard, gray, and leathery. Ju-ju zombies have a spark 
of intelligence. A hateful light bums in their eyes, as they realize 
their condition and wish to destroy living things. They under¬ 


stand full-sentence instructions with conditions, and use simple 
tactics and strategies. Since they became zombies at the moment 
of death, their bodies tend to be in better condition. Ju-ju zom~ 
hies use normal initiative rules to determine when they strike. 
They are dexterous enough to use normal weapons, although 
they must be specifically commanded to do so. These zombies 
can hurl weapons like javelins or spears, and can fire bows and 
crossbows. Their Dexterity allows them to climb walls as a thief 
(92%) and they strike as a 6 Hit Die monster. Ju-ju zombies are 
turned as specters. 

The animating force of a Ju-ju zombie is more strongly tied to 
the Negative Material plane. The result is that only +1 or better 
magical weapons cart harm them. Regardless of the magic on the 
weapon, edged and cleaving weapons inflict normal damage, 
while blunt and piercing weapons cause half damage. In addition 
to normal zombie spell immunities, ju-ju zombies are immune to 
mind affecting spells and pskmics. illusions, and to electricity 
and magic missiles. Fire causes only half damage. 

Zombie Lord 

The zombie lord is a living creature that has taken on the foul 
powers and abilities of the undead. They are formed on rare oc¬ 
casions as the result of a raise dead spell gone awry. Zombie lords 
look as they did in Life, save that their skin has turned to the pale 
grey of death, and their flesh is rotting and decaying. The odor of 
vile corruption and rotting meat hangs about them, and carrion 
feeding insects often buzz about them to dine on the bits of flesh 
and ichor that drop from their bodies. 

The zombie lords can speak those languages they knew in life 
and they seem to have a telepathic or mystical ability to converse 
freely with the living dead. Further, they can speak with dead 
merely by touching a corpse. Zombie lords are turned as vam¬ 
pires. 

When forced into combat, it relies on the great strength of its 
two crushing fists. The odor of death surrounding the zombie 
lord is so potent it causes horrible effects in those who breathe it. 
On the first round a character comes within 30 yards, he must 
save vs, poison or be affected m some way* The following results 
are possible: 


373 





Zombie 


ld6 Roll Effect 

1 Weakness (as the spell). 

2 Cause disease (as the spell). 

3 -1 point of Constitution. 

4 Contagion (as the spell), 

5 Character unable to act for ld4 rounds due to nau¬ 
sea and vomiting, 

6 Character dies instantly and becomes a zombie un¬ 
der control of the zombie lord, 

All zombies within sight of the zombie lord axe subject to its 
mental instructions. Further the creature can use the senses of 
any zombie within a mile of it to leam all that is happening with¬ 
in a very large area. Once per day, the zombie lord can animate 
dead to transform dead creatures into zombies. This works as 
described in the Players Handbook except that it can be used on 
the living. .Any living creature with fewer Hit Dice than the zom¬ 
bie lord can be attacked in this manner, A targeL who fails a sav¬ 
ing throw vs. death is slam. In Jd4 rounds, the slain creature rises 
as a zombie under the zombie lord s command. 

Zombie lords seek out places of death as lairs. Often, they live 
in old graveyards or on the site of a tremendous battle—any 
place there may be bodies to animate and feast upon. The mind 
of the zombie lord tends to focus on death and the creation of 
more undead. The regions around their lairs are often littered 
with the decaying bodies, half eaten, of those who have tried to 
confront the foul beast. 

The zombie lord comes into being by chance, and only under 
certain conditions. First, an evil human must die at the hand of 
an urtdead creatures. Second, an attempt to raise the character 
must be made. Third, the corpse must fail its resurrection surviv¬ 
al roll. Fourth and last, a deity of evil must show 'favor*" to the 
deceased, and curse him or her with the 'gift of eternal life."' 
Within one week of the raise attempt, the corpse awakens as a 
zombie lord. 

Sea Zombie 

Sea zombies &lt;also known as drowned ones) are the animated 
corpses of humans who died at sea. Although similar to land- 
dwelling zombies, they are free-willed and are rumored to be ani¬ 
mated by the Will of the god Nerull the Reaper (or another similar 
evil deity). 

The appearance of drowned ones matches their name: they 
look like human corpses that have been underwater for some 
time: bloated and discolored flesh dripping with foul water, emp¬ 
ty eye-sockets, tongue frequently protruding from between 
blackened lips. Their visage and the stench of decay surrounding 
them are so disgusting that anyone seeing a drowned one or com¬ 
ing within 20 feet of one must roll a saving throw vs. poison. A 
failed saving throw indicates that the character is nauseated, suf¬ 
fering a -1 penalty to his attack roll and a +1 penalty to his AC 
for 2d4 rounds. On land, drowned ones move slowly, with a 
clumsy, shambling gait. In water, however, they can swim with 
frightening speed. 

Drowned ones have an abiding hatred for the living and attack 
them at any opportunity. These attacks often show surprising 
cunning (for example, luring ships onto the rocks and attacking 
the sailors as they try to save themselves from the wreck). 
Drowned ones take advantage of their swimming speed by at¬ 
tacking ships as they lie at anchor—climbing aboard the vessel 
and trying to drive the sailors overboard, where they can deal 
with them more easily. 



Drowned ones attack with the weapons typical of sailors: 
short swords, daggers, hooks, clubs, belaying pins, etc. Because 
of the unnatural strength of the creatures, these weapons all in¬ 
flict IdlO points of damage. The putrid water that drips from the 
drowned ones contains many bacteria, so any successful hit has a 
10% chance of causing a severe disease in the victim. The water¬ 
logged condition of the creatures flesh means that fire and fire- 
based magic cause only hall damage. Lightning, electrical, and 
cold-based attacks inflict double damage. Drowned ones are im¬ 
mune to sleep, charm spells, illusions, and other mind-altering 
spells. Because they are created by the direct will of a deity they 
cannot be turned. 

Many of the humans who become drowned ones were priests 
while alive, and they retain their powers as undead. There is a 
50% chance that each drowned one encountered is a priest of 
level ld4. These creatures are granted their spells directly from 
Nerull (or similar deity), receiving only baneful spells. 

Drowned ones congregate in loose packs. Their only motiva¬ 
tion is their hatred for the living. They have no need to eat, al¬ 
though they rend and chew the flesh of their prey (this Is 
probably just to strike terror in others). Underwater, drowned 
ones are active around the clock and are often found in the sunk¬ 
en wrecks of the ships in which Ihey drowned. They are active 
above the surface during the night. Drowned ones normally stray 
no more than 100 yards from the water. If the wind drives the fog 
onto the coast, however, they can roam Inland as far as the tog 
reaches. When the fog retreats, or when the sun is about to rise, 
they must return to the water. 

Drowned ones communicate among themselves by a form of 
telepathy: they have no need of a spoken language (other than 
for spelkasting). The verbal components for spells are spoken in 
unintelligible whispers.

Appendix 1: Instructions for the Blank Monster Form 


When designing a monster avoid extremes. It is a common 
mistake to make a monster incredibly tough for no reason. Re¬ 
ally tough monsters are very rare! If a monster has an extreme 
ability or combat statistic, there should be a good reason. In 
the same light, Fit the monster's abilities to its description. 
Players need a fair chance to anticipate what the monster 
might do. For example, a monster that can fly should have 
wings, or else usually be encountered aloft, If a monster will 
have a surprising ability, keep it to just one, and have a good 
reason for the surprise. 

Not all monsters have to be evil. There are many other rea¬ 
sons a monster can be dangerous without arbitrarily making it 
evil. For example, any creature will fight to protect its family or 
territory whether it is good or evil. 

Characters should be able to negoitate with or intimidate 
many creatures, but negotiating with a monster does not always 
mean giving it treasure Most animals will put off an attack if 
tossed a free meal they can eat in peace: intelligent creatures have 
many different motivations. Try not to force characters into hav¬ 
ing to kill every monster they meet. IF a monster is left alive after 
an enounter it might be encountered again, and become a regu¬ 
lar part of the campaign, 

CLIMATE TERR.VIN: Restrict your monsters reasonably. As a 
rule, only tool-making creatures can be found in every dimate or 
every terrain. Remember that the physical design of a monster 
should make sense for the climate and the terrain. 

FREQUENCY: Monsters should not dominate the landscape 
unless your campaign plot requires them to. Most monsters 
avoid settled areas because organized groups of humans and 
demihumans tend to kill them. 

ORGANIZATION: Give a lot of thought to this entry; it deter¬ 
mines the group tendencies of the monster, A pack can be con¬ 
trolled by controlling its leader, A flock, on the other hand, has 
no leader, but it does have a pecking order. 

ACTIVITY CYCLE: Most monsters need to rest. When are they 
out and about? When are they sleeping] These habits should 
make sense with the diet and climate/terrain of the monster, 

DIET: What does the monster eat? Not every monster is a man- 
eater, A wild bull is just as dangerous as a tiger, but it does not eat 
meat. Remember, fangs and claws imply carnivores, tusks and 
horns imply herbivores. 

INTELLIGENCE: Avoid the tendency to make monsters too in¬ 
telligent or too stupid. A creature living in the middle of the jun¬ 
gle with no manipulative organs is not likely to be intelligent. 
Really high intelligence usually implies civilization, or at least so¬ 
phisticated tools. On the other hand, monsters that must fight to 
survive must have enough intelligence or other natural ability to 
conquer their f oes. 

TREASURE: Treasure is usually collected only by intelligent 
creatures. An animal type may guard a treasure for another crea¬ 
ture, but the treasure itself belongs to the intelligence that set it 
there as a guard. Monsters that care little for riches and magical 
items might still have some as a result of encounters, but things 
will be scattered and ill-kept, often rusting away to worthless¬ 
ness. Intelligent monsters, on the other hand, will use their magi¬ 
cal treasures to their best advantage—which may be no help at 
all to the characters! 

ALIGNMENT: This is a broad description of the moral and eth¬ 
ical tendencies of the monster. A creature of animal intelligence 


has no morals or ethics, and hence is of neutral alignment. In 
general, try to avoid extremes, unless these fit the monster. 

NO, APPEARING: The number of monsters typically encoun¬ 
tered should correspond to the other facts about the monster. A 
solitary monster does not travel in a pack pf 201 In general, carni¬ 
vores travel in small groups, herbivores travel in large groups. 
This number is also a good way to keep things balanced; weak 
monsters are dangerous in large numbers, while a strong monster 
all alone is easy prey to a well-organized group of heroes. 

COMBAT STATISTICS: This includes such values as Hit Dice 
and Armor Class. They should match the physical description of 
the monster. A well-designed monster fights the way il looks, A 
small. Fuzzy creature with big, soft eyes should not have 25 Hit 
Dice, an Armor Class of -8, and swoop through the air to attack. 
The amount of damage done should reflect the weapon being 
used. Avoid the tendency to give monsters excessive Hit Dice and 
damage capabilities. The DM is the only person who gets a kick 
from seeing a PC suffer 40 points of damage in one round; play¬ 
ers don't find that amusing at all. 

See Chapter 9 of the DMG to determine THACO for monsters* 

APPEARANCE: Include in the physical description of the mon¬ 
ster its size, weight, color (skin, hair eyes, etc,), smell noises, 
type of movement (graceful walk, shambling gait, etc.), typical 
clothing, and preferred weapons. 

COMBAT: Include any special combat abilities or disabilities. 
Be sure to cover any basic strategies or tactics the monster might 
use. Remember, smart monsters use smart tactics. The strategies 
should reflect their natural advantages and disadvantages. 

HABUAPSOCIETY: How does the monster relate to others of 
its kind, and to strangers? When do they work together and 
when do they fight? How do they choose leaders and how do 
these leaders rule] What are the goals of these monsters? Where 
do they live and how does this affect their behavior? Do they use 
or make tools7 If so, what types and how are they made? Why 
does this monster have treasure? How does it get it? What is the 
nature of the family, and how many live together? Does the mon¬ 
ster have special guards or allies and how frequently are they 
Found together? 

ECOLOGY: This should Include the types of food eaten—as 
well as what eats them, if anything. Any useful by-products 
should be listed, such as fur credible parts. You may list uses for 
magical items or spells. On the other hand, don't turn your mon¬ 
ster descriptions into shopping lists. The PCs are heroes, not 
butchers or fur trappers. List other creatures that live in harmony 
with the monster or compete against it, along with information 
about the size and nature of its territory. 

VARIANTS: If there are major subraces, they should be de¬ 
tailed here. This may be a stronger leader type, an inferior ser¬ 
vant race, or a DM special, such as skeletons that hurl their finger 
joints like magic missiles, 

XP VALUE: Guidelines for awarding experience are found in 
Chapter 8 of the DMG, Hit Dice Value Modifiers for psionie 
monsters are +1 if the creature has access to only devotions, +2 
it the creature has both sciences and devotions. 

In addition to the Hit Dice Value Modifiers listed for monsters 
in the DMG, consider the following optional modifiers: +1 for 
any special movement which gives an advantage, not just flying; 
+ 2 for magic resistance over 50%, +1 for magic resistance of 
50% or under; +2 for breath weapons which can cause more 
than 20 points damage per attack, +1 for other breath weapons.

Appendix III: npcs 


NPC Parties 

To avoid delays, create NFC parties before play. 
The tables allow such parties w be set up qukkiy 
and impartially, and the DM is encouraged to 
make any changes that will enhance play. The ta¬ 
bles should be considered a starting point, 

A typical NPC party has 2-12 members—2-S 
major characters and the rest henchmen or men- 
af-arms. 

Characters: The Character Subtable provides a 
typical party structure by limiting number and 
classes of the NPC characters encountered. Deter¬ 
mine character race 120% demihuman) and demi- 
human tnullklassvs on ihe Racial Subtable 
{multidasa fesuJu can exceed the Character Subt¬ 
able limits), 

Character Level and Equipment: These will usu¬ 
ally be comparable to those ot the player charac¬ 
ters. but NPC level will rarely exceed 12th, Arms, 
armor, and equipment will be typical a 1st level 
warrior would have scale or chain armor and min- 
irn.il gear At 2nd level, banded or plate mail is 
typical, weapons profuse, and equipment com¬ 
plete (much oil, holy water, mirrors. etc.) NPC 
magir will be used if a fight breaks out. Note that 
if the NPCsare defeated, their magical items will 
enter your campaign. 

Character spalls: These are selected by the DM 
according to those most fruited to the NPC party. 
Wizards are subject to the limits of spells known. 
Henchmen spelkasttrs are treated likewise. 

Henchmen: The major MFCs will have a total 
cst 2-5 henchmen, up to the party size, with any 
remainder men-at-arms. If the encounter is below 
the 3rd dungeon level, alt those with the major 
NPCs will be henchmen. 

Henchman class and race is determined as for 
the major characters. Major NPQ&gt; are assigned 
henchmen in order of Charisma, allowing lor 
compatibility &lt;e.g,, a paladin would not follow a 
thief, nor would a ranger below 6th level have 
henchmen). A henchmans level is one-third of 
that of his master (round up or down). If the mas¬ 
ters level is above 3th. the henchman has 1 addi¬ 
tional level per 3 full levels of the master, Thus, a 
5th level mage would have a 2nd level henchman, 
while an 11 th level mage would have a 5th level 
henchman 14 + 1) Henchmen are armed much as 


major NPCs, though they are not as heavily ar¬ 
mored. Their magic is assigned as for major 
NFCs, but Ls usually less powerful, 

Mert-at-Arms: Little detail is needed for these 
other than hit poinis. They often have poor armor 
and few weapons: for example, studded leather, 
crossbow and dagger, or (at best} scale mail, 
shield, spear, long sword and backpack. They 
are seldom found underground below the 3rd 
dungeon level.
